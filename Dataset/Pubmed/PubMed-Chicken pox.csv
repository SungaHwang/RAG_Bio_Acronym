37648424,"Catch-up vaccination and enhanced immunization against hepatitis B, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella in children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.","BACKGROUND: Limited data exist about the vaccination of children with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) against vaccine preventable diseases. This study identified the vaccination status of children with ITP against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, completed the immunization of children with inadequate immunization, re-evaluated post-vaccination antibody titers and identified probable vaccination-related complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All of 46 children had chronic ITP were included. Seroconversion of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella, measles, rubella and mumps vaccines was screened. All children with seronegative antibodies against vaccine preventable disease were given a vaccination appointment. Antibody levels were re-measured during a period ranging from 1 to 6 months. Potential complications were detected.
RESULTS: There were 46 children with a mean age of 12.25 years. All children had chronic ITP and received intravenous immunoglobulin at least once previously. Considering the vaccination status, 50% (23 children) had vaccinations appropriate for their age, 47.8% (22 children) did not know their vaccination status and 2.2% (1 patient) did not have vaccinations. Seven children (15.2%) were seropositive for all antibody types and the remaining 39 children were scheduled for vaccination. Post-vaccination antibody titers confirmed that all children became seropositive for each disease. There was no complication in any patient.
CONCLUSION: Immunization against hepatitis B, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella is insufficient in a considerable number of children with ITP, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) immunization being the most frequently inadequate. After immunization, adequate seroconversion levels were achievable without complications.","['Taşar S', 'Taşar MA', 'Saç RÜ', 'Alioğlu B']",2023,69,4,J Trop Pediatr,"Taşar S, et al.

37643745,Estimating the health economic impact of the universal varicella vaccination in Argentina from 2015 to 2019.,"Since the introduction of Universal Varicella Vaccination (UVV) in the Argentinean National Immunization Program in 2015, a significant decline in the incidence of varicella has been reported. This study aimed to estimate the economic impact of single-dose UVV in Argentina from 2015 to 2019. The economic impact was assessed based on the observed incidence of varicella in the post-UVV period and the number of cases avoided, obtained from a previously published study that used an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The weighted average cost per case was calculated using local studies. The post-UVV cost reductions were calculated by multiplying the number of cases avoided from 2015 -2019 by the weighted average cost per case. Data were summarized yearly and by peak (September-November) periods for the target (1-4 years) and overall populations. We estimated avoided costs of United States dollars (USD) $65 million in the target population and $112 million in the overall population over 4 years following UVV introduction. We observed a trend toward greater reductions in costs over time, with substantial differences observed in peak periods. We estimated that the single-dose UVV program considerably reduced the economic burden of varicella in Argentina by avoiding direct and indirect costs associated with varicella management.","['Giglio N', 'Lasalvia P', 'Pawaskar M', 'Parellada CI', 'Rosselli D', 'Babic VV', 'Neyro SE']",2023,19,2,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Giglio N, et al.

37639575,Mpox and Chicken Pox Coinfection Complicated by Acute Urinary Retention: A Case Report.,"INTRODUCTION: Mpox and Chicken pox have similar presentations, sometimes causing a diagnostic dilemma. Reports have emerged of coinfections, mostly in the central African region.
CASE REPORT: Index patient is a 23-year-old female who presented with a 2-week history of exanthematous vesiculopustular rashes which started from her genital and groin area with accompanying vulvar swelling. It was then followed by other similar rashes involving mainly her face and limbs with some on her trunk. There was also an associated high grade continuous fever. Rashes were painful and itchy with associated cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Following admission, patient had increasing dysuria with accompanying acute urinary retention due to the discomfort accompanying micturition which was relieved by urethral catheterization and resolved with intravenous infusion and parenteral empirical antibiotics for superimposed bacterial infection. Polymerase chain reaction from her skin lesion sample was positive for both monkey pox and chicken pox. She was also given a course of acyclovir and made an uneventful recovery after 12 days of admission and was discharged.
CONCLUSION: We report a rare manifestation of acute urinary retention in a HIV-negative female patient with Mpox and chicken pox co-infection.","['Onukak AE', 'Nga CN', 'Ubani BC', 'Umoinwek E', 'Umoette N']",2023,40,8,West Afr J Med,"Onukak AE, et al.

37632006,The Spectrum of Neurological Manifestations of Varicella-Zoster Virus Reactivation.,"Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) is a pathogenic human alpha herpes virus that causes varicella (chicken pox) as a primary infection and, following a variable period of latency in different ganglionic neurons, it reactivates to produce herpes zoster (shingles). The focus of this review is on the wide spectrum of the possible neurological manifestations of VZV reactivation. While the most frequent reactivation syndrome is herpes zoster, this may be followed by the serious and painful post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and by many other neurological conditions. Prominent among these conditions is a VZV vasculopathy, but the role of VZV in causing giant cell arteritis (GCA) is currently controversial. VZV reactivation can also cause segmental motor weakness, myelitis, cranial nerve syndromes, Guillain-Barre syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and zoster sine herpete, where a neurological syndrome occurs in the absence of the zoster rash. The field is complicated by the relatively few cases of neurological complications described and by the issue of causation when a neurological condition is not manifest at the same time as the zoster rash.",['Kennedy PGE'],2023,15,8,Viruses,Kennedy PGE.

37585612,"Assessing vaccine effectiveness for varicella in Wuxi, China: a time-series analysis.","OBJECTIVE: The varicella vaccine is not included in the national childhood immunization schedules in China. Varicella epidemics and outbreaks are frequently reported, and the evidence for the effectiveness of the varicella vaccine remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate varicella vaccine effectiveness in Wuxi, China.
METHODS: Varicella surveillance data were extracted from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention, and vaccination data were obtained from the Vaccination Integrated Service Management Information System of Jiangsu Province, China. Time-series analysis approaches were used to estimate varicella vaccine effectiveness.
RESULTS: A total of 16,093 varicella cases among children aged 1-6 years between January 2016 and December 2020 were analysed. A total of 217,297 children completed a two-dose varicella vaccination series.

37559096,Herpesviruses reactivation following COVID-19 vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The reactivation of herpesviruses (HHV) in COVID-19 patients is evident in the literature. Several reports have been published regarding the reactivation of these viruses (HSV, VZV, EBV, and CMV) among those who got COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we aimed to review the current evidence to assess whether HHVs reactivation has any association with the prior administration of COVID-19 vaccines.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on 25 September 2022 in PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and EMBASE. We included all observational studies, case reports, and case series which reported the reactivation of human herpesviruses following administration of COVID-19 vaccines.
RESULTS: Our systematic search showed 80 articles that meet the eligibility criteria. Among the evaluated COVID-19 vaccines, most of the vaccines were mRNA based. Evidence from observational studies showed the possible relation between COVID-19 vaccine administration and VZV and HSV reactivation. The results of our proportion meta-analysis showed that the rate of VZV reactivation among those who received the COVID-19 vaccine was 14 persons per 1000 vaccinations (95% CI 2.97-32.80). Moreover, our meta-analysis for HSV reactivation showed the rate of 16 persons per 1000 vaccinations (95% CI 1.06-46.4). Furthermore, the evidence from case reports/series showed 149 cases of HHV reactivation. There were several vaccines that caused reactivation including BNT162b2 mRNA or Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 76), Oxford-AstraZeneca (n = 22), mRNA-1273 or Moderna (n = 17), Sinovac (n = 4), BBIBP-CorV or Sinopharm (n = 3), Covaxin (n = 3), Covishield (n = 3), and Johnson and Johnson (n = 1). Reactivated HHVs included varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (n = 114), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n = 15), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (n = 14), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (n = 6), and HHV-6 (n = 2). Most cases reported their disease after the first dose of the vaccine. Many patients reported having comorbidities, of which hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chicken pox, and atrial fibrillation were common.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our study showed the possible association between COVID-19 vaccination and herpesvirus reactivation. The evidence for VZV and HSV was supported by observational studies. However, regarding other herpesviruses (EBV and CMV), further research especially from observational studies and clinical trials is required to elucidate the interaction between COVID-19 vaccination and their reactivation.","['Shafiee A', 'Amini MJ', 'Arabzadeh Bahri R', 'Jafarabady K', 'Salehi SA', 'Hajishah H', 'Mozhgani SH']",2023,28,1,Eur J Med Res,"Shafiee A, et al.

37530949,Herpes Zoster Burden of Disease and Clinical Management in Turkey: A Comprehensive Literature Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) and typically presents as an acute, painful dermatomal rash, but can lead to long-term, distressing complications such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Increasing trends in HZ cases are evident globally among the aging population; however, reviews investigating the epidemiology and clinical management of HZ in Turkey are lacking. Therefore, a literature review of local studies in Turkey was conducted to identify the data available and identify gaps in the literature.
METHODS: Literature searches were carried out in PubMed and local journals to retrieve published articles that reported surveillance data, seroepidemiology, patient outcomes, or clinical management related to HZ or VZV in Turkey until April 30, 2022. Studies included primary data reports, case studies, secondary data reviews, and epidemiological studies in healthy or at-risk populations; HZ was the primary focus of the review.
RESULTS: No studies reported VZV or HZ epidemiological data at a national level. One large retrospective study in Istanbul reported that HZ incidence rates significantly increased in adults 18-44 years of age between 2011 and 2019. Four single-center studies reported the proportion of dermatological patients with HZ at 0.43-1.56%. PHN was the most common reported complication, occurring in 8-58.9% of patients with HZ. However, out of 39 identified case reports, HZ ophthalmicus was the most frequently reported complication. Two studies highlighted poor disease awareness and risk perception of HZ among Turkish citizens.
CONCLUSION: Overall, there were limited comprehensive epidemiological data on HZ in Turkey. However, the abundance of case studies on HZ complications indicates a strong disease presence and diverse clinical management in Turkey. Further research will be important to understand the impact of HZ, increase disease awareness, and support the introduction of new preventative strategies.","['Badur S', 'Senol E', 'Azap A', 'Yesiloglu C', 'Ozakay A', 'Ozturk S', 'Guzman-Holst A']",2023,,,Infect Dis Ther,"Badur S, et al.

This form of HZO can be the first manifestation of reactivation of varicella zoster virus and can masquerade as peripheral ulcerative keratitis. A 45-year-old male treated for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) one month back presented with painful diminution of vision in the right eye (RE) for two weeks without any associated vesicular rash or neuralgia. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity in RE was 2/60 with non-marginal upper lid defect, and multiple linear contracture scars involving the upper lid, right temple, and preauricular region. There were associated peripheral corneal ring infiltrates, disc-shaped central stromal edema, and reduced corneal sensation. The patient had a history of chicken pox in childhood and was recently diagnosed with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Though corneal scrapings were negative on Tzanck smear, a presumptive clinical diagnosis of herpetic disciform keratitis was made, and the patient was started on oral and topical acyclovir with steroids. This was confirmed with improving clinical course and detection of herpes zoster DNA on polymerase chain reaction from corneal scrapings. Lid reconstruction for associated lid defect was performed using paramedian forehead flap, which was remodeled at 16 weeks. Our case, a seropositive RA patient, had reactivation of varicella zoster manifesting as peripheral serpiginous and disciform keratitis activated after NF. There are a few case reports of periorbital NF following HZO in immunocompromised patients. However, till date, no case of HZO occurring after periorbital NF has been reported. Also, in our case, reactivation of HZO presented as disciform and serpiginous keratitis without any precedent herpetic rash or neuralgia.","['Gupta V', 'Pal H', 'Das S', 'Pathuri DS', 'Vathulya M']",2023,15,6,Cureus,"Gupta V, et al.

37469289,"Impact of implementing a free varicella vaccination policy on incidence in Wuxi City, China: an interrupted time series analysis.","Varicella vaccination is optional and requires self-payment. On 1 December 2018, Wuxi City launched a free varicella vaccination program for children. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in varicella incidence before and after the implementation of the policy. The data were obtained from official information systems and statistical yearbooks. We divided the period into chargeable (January 2017 to November 2018) and free (December 2018 to December 2021) periods. Interrupt time series analysis was used to conduct a generalised least-squares regression analysis for the two periods. A total of 51,071 varicella cases were reported between January 2017 and December 2021. After the implementation of the policy, there was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of varicella (β2 = -0.140, P = 0.017), and the slope of the incidence also decreased by 0.012 (P = 0.015). Following policy implementation, the incidence decreased in all age groups, with the largest decline observed among children aged 8-14 years (β2 = -1.109, P = 0.009), followed by children aged ≤7 years (β2 = -0.894, P = 0.013).

37465273,Poultry health constraints in smallholder village poultry systems in Northern Ghana and Central Tanzania.,"INTRODUCTION: Smallholder poultry production is a major contributor to food security and rural livelihoods in low-and middle-income countries. However, infectious diseases limit improvements to smallholder poultry production and performance of the sector in general. Infectious diseases of poultry, especially viral diseases, have major impacts on the health and productivity of flocks and account for significant morbidities and mortalities of birds each year.
METHODS: This study utilized participatory epidemiology approaches to better understand the poultry health constraints and challenges faced by smallholder poultry producers in village poultry systems in Northern Ghana and Central Tanzania.
RESULTS: The results show dominance of small-scale semi-intensive and extensive scavenging poultry production systems in the study areas. Newcastle disease ranked as the highest cause of morbidity and mortality in chickens in the two countries. The disease occurred mainly during the months coinciding with the dry season in both countries. Other health challenges among poultry flocks included worm infestation, fowl pox, coryza, and coccidiosis. Producers, especially in rural locations, had poor access to veterinary services and critical inputs necessary for poultry production. In the Northern region of Ghana, producers lacked definitive diagnoses for sick poultry due to a shortage of veterinary personnel and diagnostic laboratories.
DISCUSSION: These challenges point to the need for increased investment in poultry disease control and prevention programs, particularly in rural areas. Interventions focused on expansion of veterinary and agricultural extension services and diagnostic laboratory capacity in rural areas and increased gender-sensitive training to enhance smallholder knowledge in poultry husbandry and disease prevention measures will support the development of the smallholder village poultry systems. Tapping into the diverse genetic reservoir of local chicken ecotypes with enhanced resistance to Newcastle disease through genomic selection, coupled with models for enhancing ND vaccination supply and use in the rural areas are potential future avenues for addressing ND constraints to production.","['Ouma EA', 'Kankya C', 'Dione M', 'Kelly T', 'Enahoro D', 'Chiwanga G', 'Abukari Y', 'Msoffe P', 'Kayang BB', 'Zhou H']",2023,10,,Front Vet Sci,"Ouma EA, et al.

37461793,Varicella Pneumonia in Otherwise Healthy 31-Year-Old Female Nonsmoker With No Prior Varicella Immunity.,"Varicella pneumonia is a relatively rare but severe complication of primary varicella infection. It primarily affects adults and is exacerbated by risk factors such as smoking, immunocompromised status, and male gender. Left untreated, the mortality associated with varicella pneumonia is high and ranges from 10-30 percent in the literature. This is a case of an adult female patient with no prior immunity to varicella who presented with increased oxygen requirements approximately 5 days after the onset of cutaneous symptoms. Her symptoms quickly improved after 1-day post administration of valacyclovir, and on discharge, she was prescribed a 7-day course of valacyclovir. Early treatment with acyclovir is the mainstay of treatment and is essential as it has been shown to reduce long-term complications and decrease mortality. Despite the low incidence of varicella pneumonia among patients with primary varicella infection, the index of suspicion for varicella pneumonia among patients with primary varicella infection should be high in the setting of increased oxygen requirements due to the mortality and symptomatic benefits of early treatment.","['Kawzowicz M', 'Bayya M']",2023,15,6,Cureus,Kawzowicz M and Bayya M.

37439477,Intracranial invasive group A streptococcus: a neurosurgical emergency in children.,"OBJECTIVE: Invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) infections are associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. CNS involvement is rare, with iGAS accounting for only 0.2%-1% of all childhood bacterial meningitis. In 2022, a significant increase in scarlet fever and iGAS was reported globally with a displacement of serotype, causing a predominance of the emm1.0 subtype. Here, the authors report on iGAS-related suppurative intracranial complications requiring neurosurgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of consecutive cases of confirmed GAS in pediatric neurosurgical patients.
RESULTS: Five children with a median age of 9 years were treated for intracranial complications of GAS infection over a 2-month period between November 2022 and December 2022. All patients had preceding illnesses, including chicken pox and upper respiratory tract infections. Infections included subdural empyema with associated encephalitis (n = 2), extradural empyema (n = 1), intracranial abscess (n = 1), and diffuse global meningoencephalitis (n = 1). Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured from 4 children, and 2 were of the emm1.0 subtype. Antimicrobial therapy in all patients included a third-generation cephalosporin but varied in adjunctive therapy, often including a toxin synthesis inhibitor antibiotic such as clindamycin. Neurological outcomes varied; 3 patients returned to near neurological baseline, 1 had significant residual neurological deficits, and 1 patient died.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the worldwide increased incidence, intracranial complications remain rarely reported resulting in a lack of awareness of iGAS-related intracranial disease. Awareness of intracranial complications of iGAS and prompt referral to a pediatric neurology/neurosurgical center is crucial to optimize neurological outcomes.","['Hutton D', 'Kameda-Smith M', 'Afshari FT', 'Elawadly A', 'Hogg F', 'Mehta S', 'Samarasekara J', 'Aquilina K', 'Jeelani NUO', 'Tahir MZ', 'Thompson D', 'Tisdall MM', 'Silva AHD', 'Hatcher J', 'James G']",2023,,,J Neurosurg Pediatr,"Hutton D, et al.

37395442,Varicella vaccine meningoencephalitis in a child receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella vaccine, a live-attenuated Oka-strain of varicella zoster virus (VZV), is a recommended childhood vaccine by many countries. As with wild varicella strain, after primary infection, the live-attenuated virus can establish latency in sensory ganglia and reactivate causing vaccine-strain illnesses: herpes zoster (HZ), visceral or peripheral and central nervous system dissemination. We report a case of early reactivation of live-attenuated virus-HZ and meningoencephalitis-in an immunocompromised child.
METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive report of a case, in a tertiary pediatric hospital, CHU Sainte-Justine (Montréal, Canada).
RESULTS: An 18 month-year old girl diagnosed with a primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor (PNET) received the day prior to diagnosis, a first varicella vaccine (MMRV). She received chemotherapy 20 days post MMRV vaccine and autologous bone marrow transplantation 3 months post vaccination. She was considered not eligible, to acyclovir prophylaxis prior transplantation (positive for VZV IgG and negative for herpes simplex virus IgG by ELISA). At day 1 post transplantation, she developed dermatomal HZ and meningoencephalitis. Oka-strain varicella was isolated, she was treated with acyclovir and foscarnet. Neurologic status improved in 5 days. Control of VZV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid showed a slow decrease to from 5.24 log 10 copies/mL to 2.14 log 10 copies/mL in 6 weeks. No relapse was observed. She recovered without neurological sequelae.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience highlights the importance of conducting a thorough medical history regarding vaccination and serological status of newly immunocompromised patients. Intensive chemotherapy succeeding live vaccine administration <4 weeks could have influenced early and severe viral reactivation. Early initiation of prophylactic antiviral treatment is questioned in such circumstances.","['Coralie R', 'Ziad C', 'Christian R', 'Pierre T', 'Chantal B', 'Bruce T', 'Philippe O']",2023,27,6,Pediatr Transplant,"Coralie R, et al.

37384795,Delineating the seasonality of varicella and its association with climate in the tropical country of Colombia.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella causes a major health burden in many low- to middle-income countries located in tropical regions. Because of the lack of surveillance data, however, the epidemiology of varicella in these regions remains uncharacterized. Here, based on an extensive dataset of weekly varicella incidence in children ≤10 during 2011-2014 in 25 municipalities, we aimed to delineate the seasonality of varicella across the diverse tropical climates of Colombia.
METHODS: We used generalized additive models to estimate varicella seasonality, and clustering and matrix correlation methods to assess its correlation with climate. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model to examine whether including the effect of climate on varicella transmission could reproduce the observed spatiotemporal patterns.
RESULTS: Varicella seasonality was markedly bimodal, with latitudinal changes in the peaks' timing and amplitude. This spatial gradient strongly correlated with specific humidity (Mantel-statistic = 0.412, p-value = 0.001), but not temperature (Mantel-statistic = 0.077, p-value = 0.225). The mathematical model reproduced the spatial patterns observed not only in Colombia, but also México, and predicted a latitudinal gradient in Central American countries.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate large variability in varicella seasonality across Colombia. They further suggest that spatiotemporal humidity fluctuations can explain the calendar of varicella epidemics in Colombia, México, and potentially other countries in Central America.","['Barrero Guevara LA', 'Goult E', 'Rodriguez D', 'Hernandez LJ', 'Kaufer B', 'Kurth T', 'Domenech de Cellès M']",2023,,,J Infect Dis,"Barrero Guevara LA, et al.

37377251,"Spatial behavior of hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccination coverage in the state of Minas Gerais, 2020.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the spatial behavior of hepatitis A, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), and varicella vaccination coverage in children and its relationship with socioeconomic determinants in the state of Minas Gerais.
METHODS: This ecological study investigated records of doses administered to children, extracted from the Immunization Information System of 853 municipalities in Minas Gerais, in 2020. We analyzed the vaccination coverage and socioeconomic factors. Spatial scan statistics were used to identify spatial clusters and measure the relative risk based on the vaccination coverage indicator and the Bivariate Moran Index, and thus detect socioeconomic factors correlated with the spatial distribution of vaccination. We used the cartographic base of the state and its municipalities and the ArcGIS and SPSS software programs.
RESULTS: Hepatitis A (89.0%), MMR (75.7%), and varicella (89.0%) showed low vaccination coverage. All vaccines analyzed had significant clusters. The clusters most likely to vaccinate their population were mainly located in the Central, Midwest, South Central, and Northwest regions, while the least likely were in the North, Northeast, and Triângulo do Sul regions. The municipal human development index, urbanization rate, and gross domestic product were spatially dependent on vaccination coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: The spatial behavior of hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccination coverage is heterogeneous and associated with socioeconomic factors. We emphasize that vaccination records require attention and should be continuously monitored to improve the quality of information used in services and research.","['Oliveira GCCF', 'Arroyo LH', 'Vimieiro AM', 'Gusmão JD', 'Oliveira VC', 'Guimarães EAA']",2023,26,,Rev Bras Epidemiol,"Oliveira GCCF, et al.

37376483,Advances in Alpha Herpes Viruses Vaccines for Human.,"Alpha herpes simplex viruses are an important public health problem affecting all age groups. It can produce from common cold sores and chicken pox to severe conditions like encephalitis or newborn mortality. Although all three subtypes of alpha herpes viruses have a similar structure, the produced pathology differs, and at the same time, the available prevention measures, such as vaccination. While there is an available and efficient vaccine for the varicella-zoster virus, for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, after multiple approaches from trivalent subunit vaccine to next-generation live-attenuated virus vaccines and bioinformatic studies, there is still no vaccine available. Although there are multiple failed approaches in present studies, there are also a few promising attempts; for example, the trivalent vaccine containing herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoproteins C, D, and E (gC2, gD2, gE2) produced in baculovirus was able to protect guinea pigs against vaginal infection and proved to cross-protect against HSV-1. Another promising vaccine is the multivalent DNA vaccine, SL-V20, tested in a mouse model, which lowered the clinical signs of infection and produced efficient viral eradication against vaginal HSV-2. Promising approaches have emerged after the COVID-19 pandemic, and a possible nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine could be the next step. All the approaches until now have not led to a successful vaccine that could be easy to administer and, at the same time, offer antibodies for a long period.","['Preda M', 'Manolescu LSC', 'Chivu RD']",2023,11,6,Vaccines (Basel),"Preda M, et al.

37370031,Monkeypox detection using deep neural networks.,"BACKGROUND: In May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region announced an atypical Monkeypox epidemic in response to reports of numerous cases in some member countries unrelated to those where the illness is endemic. This issue has raised concerns about the widespread nature of this disease around the world. The experience with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased awareness about pandemics among researchers and health authorities.
METHODS: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promising performance in detecting COVID-19 and predicting its outcomes. As a result, researchers have begun applying similar methods to detect Monkeypox disease. In this study, we utilize a dataset comprising skin images of three diseases: Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, and Normal cases. We develop seven DNN models to identify Monkeypox from these images. Two scenarios of including two classes and four classes are implemented.
RESULTS: The results show that our proposed DenseNet201-based architecture has the best performance, with Accuracy = 97.63%, F1-Score = 90.51%, and Area Under Curve (AUC) = 94.27% in two-class scenario; and Accuracy = 95.18%, F1-Score = 89.61%, AUC = 92.06% for four-class scenario. Comparing our study with previous studies with similar scenarios, shows that our proposed model demonstrates superior performance, particularly in terms of the F1-Score metric. For the sake of transparency and explainability, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-Cam) were developed to interpret the results. These techniques aim to provide insights into the decision-making process, thereby increasing the trust of clinicians.
CONCLUSION: The DenseNet201 model outperforms the other models in terms of the confusion metrics, regardless of the scenario. One significant accomplishment of this study is the utilization of LIME and Grad-Cam to identify the affected areas and assess their significance in diagnosing diseases based on skin images. By incorporating these techniques, we enhance our understanding of the infected regions and their relevance in distinguishing Monkeypox from other similar diseases. Our proposed model can serve as a valuable auxiliary tool for diagnosing Monkeypox and distinguishing it from other related conditions.","['Sorayaie Azar A', 'Naemi A', 'Babaei Rikan S', 'Bagherzadeh Mohasefi J', 'Pirnejad H', 'Wiil UK']",2023,23,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Sorayaie Azar A, et al.

37361273,Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic measures on incidence and representation of other infectious diseases in Germany: a lesson to be learnt.,"AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a wide range of serious health, social and economic consequences. To counteract the pandemic, various measures and restrictions such as lockdowns, closures, social distancing, hygiene, and protective measures such as wearing face masks have been enforced. Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures also had effects on other transmittable diseases. This study therefore determined the impact on case numbers and interest for other infectious diseases as well.
SUBJECT AND METHODS: Anonymized data on reported case numbers from the German Robert Koch Institute and data from Google Trends about the search interest have been used in this study to track courses of infectious diseases before and during the coronavirus pandemic in Germany.
RESULTS: The results of this analysis clearly demonstrated that the case numbers of influenza, whooping cough, measles, mumps, scarlet fever and chicken pox decreased in the pandemic years, most probably due to anti-pandemic measures in Germany. Additionally, the Google Trends analysis demonstrated public awareness, documented by a corresponding search interest, for the new topic COVID-19 and for other infectious diseases.

37359326,Blockchain-enabled healthcare monitoring system for early Monkeypox detection.,"The recent emergence of monkeypox poses a life-threatening challenge to humans and has become one of the global health concerns after COVID-19. Currently, machine learning-based smart healthcare monitoring systems have demonstrated significant potential in image-based diagnosis including brain tumor identification and lung cancer diagnosis. In a similar fashion, the applications of machine learning can be utilized for the early identification of monkeypox cases. However, sharing critical health information with various actors such as patients, doctors, and other healthcare professionals in a secure manner remains a research challenge. Motivated by this fact, our paper presents a blockchain-enabled conceptual framework for the early detection and classification of monkeypox using transfer learning. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated in Python 3.9 using a monkeypox dataset of 1905 images obtained from the GitHub repository. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, various performance estimators, namely accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, are employed. The performance of different transfer learning models, namely Xception, VGG19, and VGG16, is compared against the presented methodology. Based on the comparison, it is evident that the proposed methodology effectively detects and classifies the monkeypox disease with a classification accuracy of 98.80%. In future, multiple skin diseases such as measles and chickenpox can be diagnosed using the proposed model on the skin lesion datasets.","['Gupta A', 'Bhagat M', 'Jain V']",2023,,,J Supercomput,"Gupta A, et al.

Varicella is very contagious through its transmission by direct contact with vesicular skin lesions that contain high titers of infectious virus and respiratory droplets. While the clinical manifestations of primary VZV infection are well recognized, defining the molecular mechanisms that drive VZV pathogenesis in the naive host before adaptive antiviral immunity is induced has been a challenge due to species specificity. This review focuses on advances made in identifying the differentiated human host cells targeted by VZV to cause varicella, the processes involved in viral takeover of these heterogenous cell types, and the host cell countermeasures that typically culminate in a benign illness.

37349224,Trend of immunity against measles and varicella zoster virus in healthcare workers in Korea.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the seroprevalence of measles and varicella zoster virus (VZV) among healthcare workers (HCW) and evaluate the concordance between self-reported history of previous disease or vaccination and seropositivity.
DESIGN: A seroprevalence study and survey.
SETTING: A university-affiliated tertiary care hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: All HCWs working in high-risk services in 2017 underwent serologic tests and survey; all new HCWs employed in the subsequent years, serologic tests only.
METHODS: A serologic study was conducted using chemiluminescence immunoassay (2017) or enzyme immunoassays (2018 and later). HCWs who underwent serological testing in 2017 completed a self-administered questionnaire on their history of infection and vaccination.
RESULTS: A total of 10,278 and 9607 HCWs underwent serologic tests for measles and VZV IgG, respectively, from 2017 to 2022. The overall seropositivity rates for measles and VZV were 78.1 % and 92.8 %, respectively. Measles seropositivity declined gradually from >90 % in the HCWs born in the 1960s to <80 % in those born in the 1990s. There was a significant difference in measles seropositivity between the birth cohorts (BCs) 1967-1984 and 1985-1999 (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 1.16; 95 % confidence interval, 1.14-1.18). The seropositivity for VZV was stable, at >90 % in all BCs. The self-reported vaccination history was not independently associated with seropositivity, and the negative predictive value of the survey was very low (9.6 % and 13.1 %, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Measles seropositivity showed a substantial decline among HCWs born in 1985 or later, while varicella seropositivity remained high. The self-reported vaccination history was not sufficiently reliable for screening HCWs.","['Shin L', 'Choi JR', 'Huh K', 'Chung DR', 'Cho SY', 'Jeong J', 'Ko JH', 'Kang CI', 'Peck KR']",2023,41,32,Vaccine,"Shin L, et al.

37325350,Post-viral idiopathic purpura fulminans is associated with inherited thrombophilia and anti-cardiolipin antibodies.,"INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic purpura fulminans (IPF) is a rare and severe coagulation disorder, associated with transient anti-protein S (anti-PS) antibodies in the context of post-viral infection such as varicella. Anti-protein S antibodies are frequently found in the context of varicella, in contrast with the rarity of IPF. Other factors such as anti-phospholipid antibodies (APL) and inherited thrombophilia may be associated with severe vascular complication.
METHOD: This is an ancillary study of a French multicenter retrospective series and systematic review of literature. We analyzed patients who were tested for inherited thrombophilia, namely antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency; prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism (FII:G20210A),Factor V R506Q polymorphism (FV:R506Q); and/or for APL (lupus anticoagulant (LA), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACL), or anti-beta 2-GPI antibodies (Aβ2GP1).
RESULTS: Among the 25 patients tested for inherited thrombophilia, 7 (28%) had positive results. Three had FV R506Q, two FII:G20210A, one compound heterozygote FV:R506Q associated to FII:G20210A, and one protein C deficiency. APL testing was performed in 32 patients. It was positive in 19 patients (59%): 17 ACL (53%), 5 LA (16%), 4 Aβ2GP1 (13%).

Medline and EMBASE were searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant studies. The included articles reported varicella vaccine administration in the posttransplant period in children and adults. A pooled proportion of transplant recipients who seroconverted and who developed vaccine-strain varicella and varicella disease was generated. Eighteen articles (14 observational studies and 4 case reports) were included, reporting on 711 transplant recipients who received the varicella vaccine. The pooled proportion was 88.2% (95% confidence interval 78.0%-96.0%, 13 studies) for vaccinees who seroconverted, 0% (0%-1.2%, 13 studies) for vaccine-strain varicella, and 0.8% (0%-4.9%, 9 studies) for varicella disease. Most studies followed clinical guidelines for administering live-attenuated vaccines, with criteria that could include being at least 1 year posttransplant, 2 months postrejection episode, and on low-dose immunosuppressive medications. Varicella vaccination in transplant recipients was overall safe in the included studies, with few cases of vaccine-strain-induced varicella or vaccine failure, and although it was immunogenic, the proportion of recipients who seroconverted was lower than that seen in the general population. Our data support varicella vaccination in select pediatric solid organ transplant recipients.","['Piché-Renaud PP', 'Yue Lee E', 'Ji C', 'Qing Huang JY', 'Uleryk E', 'Teoh CW', 'Morris SK', 'Top KA', 'Upton JEM', 'Vyas MV', 'Allen UD']",2023,,,Am J Transplant,"Piché-Renaud PP, et al.

Herein, we report a survival case of visceral disseminated VZV infection in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old woman was diagnosed as SLE and initial induction therapy was started. Two months after starting the immunosuppressive therapy consisting of 40 mg of prednisolone (PSL) and 1500 mg of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) daily, she suddenly developed strong abdominal pain, which was required opioid analgesics, followed by systemic skin blisters, which were diagnosed as varicella. Laboratory findings showed rapid exacerbation of severe liver failure, coagulation abnormalities and increased numbers of blood VZV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Therefore, she was diagnosed as visceral disseminated VZV infection. Multidisciplinary treatment with acyclovir, immunoglobulin and antibiotics was started, the dose of PSL was reduced, and MMF was withdrawn. By their treatment, her symptoms were resolved and she finally discharged.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case highlights the importance of a clinical suspicion of visceral disseminated VZV infections, and the necessity of immediate administration of acyclovir and reduced doses of immunosuppressant to save patients with SLE.","['Ishino Y', 'Fukasawa H', 'Kitamoto S', 'Nakagami D', 'Kaneko M', 'Yasuda H', 'Furuya R']",2023,24,1,BMC Nephrol,"Ishino Y, et al.

37289833,Viral proteogenomic and expression profiling during productive replication of a skin-tropic herpesvirus in the natural host.,"Efficient transmission of herpesviruses is essential for dissemination in host populations; however, little is known about the viral genes that mediate transmission, mostly due to a lack of natural virus-host model systems. Marek's disease is a devastating herpesviral disease of chickens caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV) and an excellent natural model to study skin-tropic herpesviruses and transmission. Like varicella zoster virus that causes chicken pox in humans, the only site where infectious cell-free MD virions are efficiently produced is in epithelial skin cells, a requirement for host-to-host transmission. Here, we enriched for heavily infected feather follicle epithelial skin cells of live chickens to measure both viral transcription and protein expression using combined short- and long-read RNA sequencing and LC/MS-MS bottom-up proteomics. Enrichment produced a previously unseen breadth and depth of viral peptide sequencing. We confirmed protein translation for 84 viral genes at high confidence (1% FDR) and correlated relative protein abundance with RNA expression levels. Using a proteogenomic approach, we confirmed translation of most well-characterized spliced viral transcripts and identified a novel, abundant isoform of the 14 kDa transcript family via IsoSeq transcripts, short-read intron-spanning sequencing reads, and a high-quality junction-spanning peptide identification. We identified peptides representing alternative start codon usage in several genes and putative novel microORFs at the 5' ends of two core herpesviral genes, pUL47 and ICP4, along with strong evidence of independent transcription and translation of the capsid scaffold protein pUL26.5. Using a natural animal host model system to examine viral gene expression provides a robust, efficient, and meaningful way of validating results gathered from cell culture systems.","['Volkening JD', 'Spatz SJ', 'Ponnuraj N', 'Akbar H', 'Arrington JV', 'Vega-Rodriguez W', 'Jarosinski KW']",2023,19,6,PLoS Pathog,"Volkening JD, et al.

37287975,Lack of strong innate immune reactivity renders macrophages alone unable to control productive Varicella-Zoster Virus infection in an isogenic human iPSC-derived neuronal co-culture model.,"With Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) being an exclusive human pathogen, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural cell culture models are an emerging tool to investigate VZV neuro-immune interactions. Using a compartmentalized hiPSC-derived neuronal model allowing axonal VZV infection, we previously demonstrated that paracrine interferon (IFN)-α2 signalling is required to activate a broad spectrum of interferon-stimulated genes able to counteract a productive VZV infection in hiPSC-neurons. In this new study, we now investigated whether innate immune signalling by VZV-challenged macrophages was able to orchestrate an antiviral immune response in VZV-infected hiPSC-neurons. In order to establish an isogenic hiPSC-neuron/hiPSC-macrophage co-culture model, hiPSC-macrophages were generated and characterised for phenotype, gene expression, cytokine production and phagocytic capacity. Even though immunological competence of hiPSC-macrophages was shown following stimulation with the poly(dA:dT) or treatment with IFN-α2, hiPSC-macrophages in co-culture with VZV-infected hiPSC-neurons were unable to mount an antiviral immune response capable of suppressing a productive neuronal VZV infection. Subsequently, a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis confirmed the lack of strong immune responsiveness by hiPSC-neurons and hiPSC-macrophages upon, respectively, VZV infection or challenge. This may suggest the need of other cell types, like T-cells or other innate immune cells, to (co-)orchestrate an efficient antiviral immune response against VZV-infected neurons.","['Van Breedam E', 'Buyle-Huybrecht T', 'Govaerts J', 'Meysman P', 'Bours A', 'Boeren M', 'Di Stefano J', 'Caers T', 'De Reu H', 'Dirkx L', 'Schippers J', 'Bartholomeus E', 'Lebrun M', 'Sadzot-Delvaux C', 'Rybakowska P', 'Alarcón-Riquelme ME', 'Marañón C', 'Laukens K', 'Delputte P', 'Ogunjimi B', 'Ponsaerts P']",2023,14,,Front Immunol,"Van Breedam E, et al.

Case report and Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND: According to WHO, there have been 9205 fatal COVID-19 cases confirmed in Saudi Arabia out of 793,729 cases overall (5). During the development of COVID-19 vaccines, several technologies were used including DNA-based, RNA-based vaccines, non-replicating viral vector vaccines, and inactivated vaccines.
OBJECTIVE: We present a case of varicella zoster virus reactivation post COVID-19 vaccine in a young medically free 16 years old female and review of the literature using the keywords ""Herpes Zoster, ""varicella zoster"","" shingles"", ""post COVID-19 vaccine"", ""Post COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations"".
METHODS: The search was conducted in Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science data bases.
RESULTS: We encountered 241 published studies in regard to post COVID-19 dermatologic manifestations including post COVID-19 vaccine herpes zoster reactivation in the English literature and one case in German. Our case and 4 other reported cases in the literature are patients aged of 20 years old and below.
CONCLUSION: Varicella zoster virus falls under the family of Herpesviridae, It's characterized by its ability to escape host immune system and remain dormant in ganglionic neurons. Reactivation of the infection will result in herpes zoster manifesting as painful vesicles in a dermatomal distribution.

37258852,Aetiology of Acute Undifferentiated Fever Among Children Under the Age of Five in Vietnam: A Prospective Study.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the aetiology of acute undifferentiated fever (AUF) among children under the age of five in Vietnam.
METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in the Thai Binh paediatric hospital, between July 2020 and July 2021 among children with AUF at admission. Real-time PCR testing 18 microbial pathogens were done on blood samples.
RESULTS: 286 children were included, with median age of 16 months. 64.7% were male. 53.9% were positive for at least one pathogen by PCR. Enterovirus, human herpesvirus 6, adenovirus, and varicella zoster virus PCR were positive for 31.1, 12.6, 1.4, and 1.0% patients, respectively. Other pathogens tested negative by PCR. During the hospital stay, based on clinical criteria 47.2% children secondarily presented with signs of respiratory tract infections, 18.9% had hand, foot and mouth disease, 4.6% had chickenpox. 4.2% presented signs of central nervous system infections, 1.0% had dengue (antigenic test) and 1.0% had signs of gastrointestinal infection. Finally, 23.1% patients presented a fever with or without a rash and no other symptoms and ultimately received a diagnosis of AUF.
CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR of blood is useful for detecting pathogens and diagnosing infectious causes of AUF. Further prospective studies with blood and urine culture testing and PCR investigation of not only blood but also cerebrospinal fluid, throat, and skin samples according to symptoms would be of interest to confirm the predominance of viral infections in children with AUF and to guide therapeutic options.","['Tran XD', 'Hoang VT', 'Dang TTD', 'Vu TP', 'To MM', 'Tran TK', 'Do MD', 'Nguyen DC', 'Nguyen QT', 'Colson P', 'Parola P', 'Marty P', 'Gautret P']",2023,13,2,J Epidemiol Glob Health,"Tran XD, et al.

37238256,Detection of Monkeypox Disease from Human Skin Images with a Hybrid Deep Learning Model.,"Monkeypox, a virus transmitted from animals to humans, is a DNA virus with two distinct genetic lineages in central and eastern Africa. In addition to zootonic transmission through direct contact with the body fluids and blood of infected animals, monkeypox can also be transmitted from person to person through skin lesions and respiratory secretions of an infected person. Various lesions occur on the skin of infected individuals. This study has developed a hybrid artificial intelligence system to detect monkeypox in skin images. An open source image dataset was used for skin images. This dataset has a multi-class structure consisting of chickenpox, measles, monkeypox and normal classes. The data distribution of the classes in the original dataset is unbalanced. Various data augmentation and data preprocessing operations were applied to overcome this imbalance. After these operations, CSPDarkNet, InceptionV4, MnasNet, MobileNetV3, RepVGG, SE-ResNet and Xception, which are state-of-the-art deep learning models, were used for monkeypox detection. In order to improve the classification results obtained in these models, a unique hybrid deep learning model specific to this study was created by using the two highest-performing deep learning models and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model together. In this hybrid artificial intelligence system developed and proposed for monkeypox detection, test accuracy was 87% and Cohen's kappa score was 0.8222.",['Uysal F'],2023,13,10,Diagnostics (Basel),Uysal F.

37233427,Diagnosis and treatment of varicella-zoster virus infection with herpetic visceral neuralgia without rash: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Herpes zoster (HZ) is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus reactivation, often leading to peripheral nervous system infection and pain. This case report aimed to present 2 patients with damaged sensory nerves originating from the visceral neurons of the lateral horn of the spinal cord.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Two patients presented intractable, severe lower back pain and abdominal pain, but without rash or herpes. A female patient was admitted 2 months after symptom onset. She was presented with paroxysmal, acupuncture-like pain in the right upper quadrant and around the umbilicus without apparent incentives. A male patient was presented with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal and spastic colic in the left waist and left middle abdomen for 3 days. Abdominal examination showed no tumors or organic lesions in their intra-abdominal tissues or organs.
DIAGNOSES: After excluding organic lesions on the waist and in abdominal organs, patients were diagnosed with herpetic visceral neuralgia without rash.
INTERVENTION: The treatment for herpes zoster neuralgia or postherpetic neuralgia was applied for 3 to 4 weeks.
OUTCOME: Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory analgesics were not effective in either patient. The therapeutic effects of herpes zoster neuralgia or postherpetic neuralgia treatment were satisfactory.
LESSONS: Herpetic visceral neuralgia can be easily misdiagnosed due to the absence of a rash or herpes, resulting in delayed treatment. When patients have severe, intractable pain but no rash or herpes, and the biochemical and imaging examinations are normal, the treatment method for HZ neuralgia can be used. If the treatment is effective, HZ neuralgia is diagnosed. If not, shingles neuralgia can be ruled out. Further investigations are required to elucidate the mechanisms of pathophysiological changes in varicella-zoster virus-induced peripheral HZ neuralgia or visceral neuralgia without herpes.","['Zeng J', 'Yang Y']",2023,102,21,Medicine (Baltimore),Zeng J and Yang Y.

Although it is usually self-limiting, it can lead to severe complications, especially in pediatric and immunocompromised patients. VZV was first discovered as a cause of myocarditis in 1953. In this review article, we aim to investigate the early clinical diagnosis of myocarditis in VZV infections and the efficacy of the VZV vaccine in preventing myocarditis. The literature search was done using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Sci-Hub databases. A high VZV mortality rate was noted among adults, infants, and immunocompromised patients.

37219811,Stroke risk after varicella-zoster virus infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection may cause vascular inflammatory changes leading to an increased risk of stroke. Previous studies have focused on the risk of stroke and less on changes in stroke risk and prognosis. We aimed to explore the changing patterns of stroke risk and stroke prognosis after VZV infection. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies on stroke after VZV infection between January 1, 2000, and October 5, 2022. Relative risks were combined for the same study subgroups using a fixed-effects model and pooled across studies using a random-effects model. 27 studies met the requirements, including 17 herpes zoster (HZ) studies and ten chickenpox studies. There was an increased risk of stroke after HZ, and this risk decreased over time: relative risk 1.80 (95% CI 1.42-2.29) within 14 days, 1.61 (95% CI 1.43-1.81) within 30 days, 1.45 (95% CI 1.33-1.58) within 90 days, 1.32 (95% CI 1.25-1.39) within 180 days, 1.27 (95% CI 1.15-1.40) at one year and 1.19 (95% CI 0.90-1.59) after one year, with the same trend in the stroke subtype. The risk of stroke after herpes zoster ophthalmicus was higher, with a maximum relative risk of 2.26 (95% CI 1.35-3.78). The risk of stroke after HZ was higher in patients aged around 40 years: relative risk 2.53 (95% CI 1.59-4.02), and similar in men and women. Also, after pooling studies of post-chickenpox stroke, we found that the middle cerebral artery and its branches were most frequently involved (78.2%), with a better prognosis in most patients (83.1%) and less frequent vascular persistence progression (8.9%). In conclusion, the risk of stroke increases after VZV infection, decreasing over time. Post-infection vascular inflammatory changes often occur in the middle cerebral artery and its branches, with a better prognosis in most patients and less frequent persistent progression.","['Lu P', 'Cui L', 'Zhang X']",2023,,,J Neurovirol,"Lu P, et al.

More than seven clades of VZV exist worldwide. In this study, we investigated the cross-reactivity of antibodies induced by clade 2 genotype vaccines against VZV strains belonging to clades 1, 2, 3, and 5 using a fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) test. Among 59 donors, 29 were vaccinated with the MAV/06 strain MG1111 (GC Biopharma, South Korea) and the other 30 were vaccinated with the Oka strain VARIVAX (Merck, USA). The sera were titrated using FAMA tests prepared with six different VZV strains (two vaccine strains, one wild-type clade 2 strain, and one each of clade 1, 3, and 5 strains). The ranges of geometric mean titers (GMTs) of FAMA against six different strains were 158.7-206.5 and 157.6-238.9 in MG1111 and VARIVAX groups, respectively. GMTs of the MG1111 group against all six strains were similar; however, GMTs of the VARIVAX group showed differences of approximately 1.5-fold depending on the strains. Nevertheless, the GMTs of the two vaccinated groups for the same strain were not significantly different. These results suggest that both MG1111 and VARIVAX vaccinations induce cross-reactive humoral immunity against other clades of VZV.","['Hwang JY', 'Kim Y', 'Lee KM', 'Shin OS', 'Gim JA', 'Shin Y', 'Park H']",2023,19,1,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Hwang JY, et al.

37191983,"Using Baidu Index Data to Improve Chickenpox Surveillance in Yunnan, China: Infodemiology Study.","BACKGROUND: Chickenpox is an old but easily neglected infectious disease. Although chickenpox is preventable by vaccines, vaccine breakthroughs often occur, and the chickenpox epidemic is on the rise. Chickenpox is not included in the list of regulated communicable diseases that must be reported and controlled by public and health departments; therefore, it is crucial to rapidly identify and report varicella outbreaks during the early stages. The Baidu index (BDI) can supplement the traditional surveillance system for infectious diseases, such as brucellosis and dengue, in China. The number of reported chickenpox cases and internet search data also showed a similar trend. BDI can be a useful tool to display the outbreak of infectious diseases.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an efficient disease surveillance method that uses BDI to assist in traditional surveillance.
METHODS: Chickenpox incidence data (weekly from January 2017 to June 2021) reported by the Yunnan Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention were obtained to evaluate the relationship between the incidence of chickenpox and BDI. We applied a support vector machine regression (SVR) model and a multiple regression prediction model with BDI to predict the incidence of chickenpox. In addition, we used the SVR model to predict the number of chickenpox cases from June 2021 to the first week of April 2022.
RESULTS: The analysis showed that there was a close correlation between the weekly number of newly diagnosed cases and the BDI. In the search terms we collected, the highest Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.747. Most BDI search terms, such as ""chickenpox,"" ""chickenpox treatment,"" ""treatment of chickenpox,"" ""chickenpox symptoms,"" and ""chickenpox virus,"" trend consistently. Some BDI search terms, such as ""chickenpox pictures,"" ""symptoms of chickenpox,"" ""chickenpox vaccine,"" and ""is chickenpox vaccine necessary,"" appeared earlier than the trend of ""chickenpox virus."" The 2 models were compared, the SVR model performed better in all the applied measurements: fitting effect, R
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that the BDI in Yunnan Province can predict the incidence of chickenpox in the same period. Thus, the BDI is a useful tool for monitoring the chickenpox epidemic and for complementing traditional monitoring systems.","['Wang Z', 'He J', 'Jin B', 'Zhang L', 'Han C', 'Wang M', 'Wang H', 'An S', 'Zhao M', 'Zhen Q', 'Tiejun S', 'Zhang X']",2023,25,,J Med Internet Res,"Wang Z, et al.

37175030,Classification of Monkeypox Images Using LIME-Enabled Investigation of Deep Convolutional Neural Network.,"In this research, we demonstrate a Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based classification model for the detection of monkeypox. Monkeypox can be difficult to diagnose clinically in its early stages since it resembles both chickenpox and measles in symptoms. The early diagnosis of monkeypox helps doctors cure it more quickly. Therefore, pre-trained models are frequently used in the diagnosis of monkeypox, because the manual analysis of a large number of images is labor-intensive and prone to inaccuracy. Therefore, finding the monkeypox virus requires an automated process. The large layer count of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures enables them to successfully conceptualize the features on their own, thereby contributing to better performance in image classification. The scientific community has recently articulated significant attention in employing artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose monkeypox from digital skin images due primarily to AI's success in COVID-19 identification. The VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet201, and AlexNet models were used in our proposed method to classify patients with monkeypox symptoms with other diseases of a similar kind (chickenpox, measles, and normal). The majority of images in our research are collected from publicly available datasets. This study suggests an adaptive k-means clustering image segmentation technique that delivers precise segmentation results with straightforward operation. Our preliminary computational findings reveal that the proposed model could accurately detect patients with monkeypox. The best overall accuracy achieved by ResNet101 is 94.25%, with an AUC of 98.59%. Additionally, we describe the categorization of our model utilizing feature extraction using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), which provides a more in-depth understanding of particular properties that distinguish the monkeypox virus.","['Lakshmi M', 'Das R']",2023,13,9,Diagnostics (Basel),Lakshmi M and Das R.

37171976,The Protective Effectiveness of 2-Dose Varicella Vaccination in Children in Korea: A Case-control Study.,"BACKGROUND: A 2-dose vaccination against varicella has been adopted in many places; however, it has not been widely introduced in Korea. This study aimed to assess 1-dose and 2-+dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed varicella in Korea to provide a scientific basis for developing an immunization strategy.
METHODS: We constructed a national cohort using national surveillance data and the national immunization registry. From the cohort, we conducted a 1:2 matched nested case-control study to estimate and compare the VE of the 1-dose and 2-dose of varicella vaccination using exact conditional logistic regression. VE was calculated as [1 - matched odds ratio (OR) × 100%].
RESULTS: From January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020, a total of 205,173 varicella cases were reported to the notifiable diseases surveillance system. Of these, we included 4,387 laboratory-confirmed varicella cases and 8,774 controls for the analyses. The VE of 1-dose vaccination was 16.8% (95% CI: -9.0% to 36.5%), whereas the VE of 2-doses of the vaccination was 98.6% (95% CI: 96.0%-99.5%).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the 2-dose vaccination strategy can be an effective strategy to prevent varicella.","['Lee YH', 'Choe YJ', 'Hong K', 'Yoon Y', 'Kim YK']",2023,42,8,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Lee YH, et al.

Using 2017 data from a Canadian national vaccine coverage survey, this study analyzed the impact of demographics and parental knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KAB) on vaccine decisions (refusal, delay and reluctance) in parents of 2-year-old children who had received at least one vaccine. The findings show that 16.8% had refused a vaccine, specifically influenza (73%), rotavirus (13%) and varicella (9%); female parents or those from Quebec or the Territories more likely to refuse. 12.8% were reluctant to accept a vaccine, usually influenza (34%), MMR (21%) and varicella (19%), but eventually accepted them upon advice from a health care provider. 13.1% had delayed a vaccine, usually because their child had health issues (54%) or was too young (18.6%) and was predicted by five or six person households. Recent immigration to Canada decreased likelihood of refusal, delay, or reluctance; however, after 10 years in Canada, these parents were as likely to refuse or be reluctant as parents born in Canada. Poor KAB increased likelihood of refusal and delay by 5 times, and reluctance by 15 times, while moderate KAB increased likelihood of refusal (OR 1.6), delay (OR 2.3) and reluctance (OR 3.6). Future research into vaccine decisions by female and/or single parents, and predictors of vaccine KAB would provide valuable information and help protect our children from vaccine preventable diseases.","['Schellenberg N', 'Petrucka P', 'Dietrich Leurer M', 'Crizzle AM']",2023,53,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Schellenberg N, et al.

37115793,Results of the first German external quality assessment scheme for the detection of monkeypox virus DNA.,"BACKGROUND: In May 2022, the monkeypox virus (MPXV) spread into non-endemic countries and the global community was quick to test the lessons learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Due to its symptomatic resemblance to other diseases, like the non-pox virus varicella zoster (chickenpox), polymerase chain reaction methods play an important role in correctly diagnosing the rash-causing pathogen. INSTAND quickly established a new external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for MPXV and orthopoxvirus (OPXV) DNA detection to assess the current performance quality of the laboratory tests.
METHODS: We analyzed quantitative and qualitative data of the first German EQA for MPXV and OPXV DNA detection. The survey included one negative and three MPXV-positive samples with different MPX viral loads. The threshold cycle (Ct) or other measures defining the quantification cycle (Cq) were analyzed in an assay-specific manner. A Passing Bablok fit was used to investigate the performance at laboratory level.
RESULTS: 141 qualitative datasets were reported by 131 laboratories for MPXV detection and 68 qualitative datasets by 65 laboratories for OPXV detection. More than 96% of the results were correctly identified as negative and more than 97% correctly identified as positive. An analysis of the reported Ct/Cq values showed a large spread of these values of up to 12 Ct/Cq. Nevertheless, there is a good correlation of results for the different MPXV concentrations at laboratory level. Only a few quantitative results in copies/mL were reported (MPXV: N = 5; OPXV: N = 2), but the results correlated well with the concentration differences between the EQA samples, which were to a power of ten each.
CONCLUSION: The EQA results show that laboratories performed well in detecting both MPXV and OPXV. However, Ct/Cq values should be interpreted with caution when conclusions are drawn about the viral load as long as metrological traceability is not granted.","['Vierbaum L', 'Wojtalewicz N', 'Kaufmann A', 'Goseberg S', 'Kaiser P', 'Grunert HP', 'Dühring U', 'Zimmermann A', 'Scholz A', 'Michel J', 'Nitsche A', 'Rabenau HF', 'Obermeier M', 'Schellenberg I', 'Zeichhardt H', 'Kammel M']",2023,18,4,PLoS One,"Vierbaum L, et al.

However, routine screening to determine serologic status is not recommended. We conducted a seroprevalence study of anti-measles and anti-Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) antibodies in adults living with HIV (PLWHA) consulting at Avicenne University Hospital in a Parisian suburb. Sera were collected in years 2018-2020 and tested by commercial immunoassays in 268 patients. Most of the patients were born in Sub-Saharan Africa (55 %) and only 23 % in Europe. Measles and varicella seropositivity were present respectively in 91.4 % and 96.2 % of patients. One patient in ten was seronegative to at least one of tested diseases. In the univariate analysis, only younger age (p = 0.027) was associated with a higher risk of measles seronegativity, while shorter time since arrival in France (p < 0.001) and shorter time since HIV discovery (p = 0.007) were associated with a higher risk of VZV seronegativity. In multivariate analysis no association was found.

37073653,"Outbreak of Monkeypox Virus Disease: An Update on Epidemiology, Pathophysiology and Available Treatment Options.","The monkeypox virus is a zoonotic illness with a tropical distribution in Africa, and around the world. The disease is spread through contact with infected animals or humans, and can also be spread from person to person through close contact with respiratory or bodily fluids. Fever, swollen lymph nodes, blisters, and crusted rashes characterize the disease. The incubation period is five to twenty-one days. It is difficult to distinguish the rash caused by infection from varicella and smallpox. Laboratory investigations are essential aspects of illness diagnosis and surveillance, and novel tests are required for more accurate and faster diagnosis. Antiviral drugs are being used to treat monkeypox. Scarring as well as other comorbidities, are prevalent in survivors, with the case mortality rate varying from 1 to 11%. The virus was found in monkeys at a Danish research facility in 1958, from which the term 'monkeypox' is derived. The primary human case was found in a child in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1970. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recently declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern. This manuscript attempts to review the various aspects of monkeypox disease and its allopathic as well as alternative treatment options available and serves as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals, researchers, and the general public.","['Kumar A', 'Angaria N', 'Singh G', 'Kumar R']",2023,23,6,Infect Disord Drug Targets,"Kumar A, et al.

In Case 1, a 58-year-old woman presented with severe right-sided chest pain under her breast that radiated to the ipsilateral back. After the initial workup ruled out cardiac and musculoskeletal etiologies, the characteristic dermatomal distribution of pain made us suspect VZV reactivation. A diagnosis of ZSH was made with positive VZV IgG and IgM serologies and symptomatic relief after famciclovir treatment. In Case 2, a 43-year-old woman presented with a severe headache and resolved sharp right flank pain. She was diagnosed with varicella meningitis after cerebrospinal fluid showed positive VZV DNA. Intravenous acyclovir treatment resulted in symptom resolution. The most common presentation of VZV reactivation is Herpes Zoster, or shingles, making ZSH a frequently missed diagnosis. High clinical suspicion is warranted to prevent life-threatening complications of ZSH.","['Yang Y', 'Mahmood T', 'Siddiqui AH', 'Aziz MA']",2023,23,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Yang Y, et al.

METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective chart review of 260 children and adults with a primary diagnosis of varicella was conducted at one private and three public hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand. Charts of varicella patients (inpatient or outpatient) were randomly selected over a 5-year period. Key outcomes included clinical complications and the use of antibiotics, antivirals, and other medications.
RESULTS: Charts of 200 children (mean age 5.7 years, range 0.3-16 years) and 60 adults (mean age 27.9 years, range 18-50 years) were reviewed. Fourteen patients (including 8 children) were hospitalized. Five percent of the children and none of the adults were immunocompromised. At least 1 varicella-related complication was reported by 7.3% (7% of children, 8.3% of adults, 
CONCLUSION: A considerable number of varicella patients, both children and adults, seeking medical consultation in Thai hospitals are prescribed antibiotics and antivirals, with one-fifth of patients being prescribed an antibiotic and almost half prescribed an antiviral. The study may be of interest to policymakers in Thailand and other Asia-Pacific countries considering UVV implementation.","['Chokephaibulkit K', 'Samant S', 'Chaisavaneeyakorn S', 'Kamolratanakul S', 'Limpadanai S', 'Kebede N', 'Stephens J', 'Sukarom I', 'Pawaskar M']",2023,39,6,Curr Med Res Opin,"Chokephaibulkit K, et al.

37026945,Severe varicella-zoster virus meningoencephalomyelitis coexisting with visceral disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection in a patient with lupus nephritis: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Meningoencephalomyelitis and visceral dissemination infection are rare but life-threatening complications of either the primary infection or reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in immunocompromised patients. To date, few studies have reported the co-existence of VZV meningoencephalomyelitis and the visceral dissemination of VZV infection.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-year-old male was diagnosed with lupus nephritis class III and was being treated with oral prednisone and tacrolimus. The patient exhibited herpes zoster 21-day after the initiation of therapy and experienced unbearable abdominal pain and generalized seizures 11 days after the onset of a zoster rash. Magnetic resonance imaging showed progressive lesions in the cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum, as well as meningeal thickening and thoracic myelitis. Computed tomography showed pulmonary interstitial infiltration, partial intestinal dilatation, and effusion. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing revealed 198,269 and 152,222 VZV-specific reads in the cerebrospinal fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, respectively.
DIAGNOSES: Based on the clinical and genetic findings, this patient was finally diagnosed with VZV meningoencephalomyelitis and visceral disseminated VZV infection.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient received intravenous acyclovir (0.5 g every 8 hours) combined with plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin. Treatment against secondary bacterial and fungal infections, organ support therapy and rehabilitation training were given simultaneously.
OUTCOME: The patient's peripheral muscle strength did not improve and repeated metagenomic next-generation sequencing showed the persistence of VZV-specific reads in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient finally abandoned therapy due to financial constraints at the 1-month follow-up.
LESSONS: Patients with autoimmune diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be warned about the possibility of developing serious neurological infections and visceral disseminated VZV infections as side effects. Early diagnosis and the early initiation of intravenous acyclovir therapy are important for such cases.","['Tao T', 'Chen J', 'Long K', 'Zhi L', 'Zhang S', 'Liu S', 'Ma Y', 'Yan H', 'Lv L', 'Xu Y', 'Wu L', 'Zhao L', 'Gao P']",2023,102,14,Medicine (Baltimore),"Tao T, et al.

37006246,Varicella Zoster Virus infects mucosal associated Invariant T cells.,"INTRODUCTION: Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells that respond to conserved pathogen-derived vitamin B metabolites presented by the MHC class I related-1 molecule (MR1) antigen presentation pathway. Whilst viruses do not synthesize these metabolites, we have reported that varicella zoster virus (VZV) profoundly suppresses MR1 expression, implicating this virus in manipulation of the MR1:MAIT cell axis. During primary infection, the lymphotropism of VZV is likely to be instrumental in hematogenous dissemination of virus to gain access to cutaneous sites where it clinically manifests as varicella (chickenpox). However, MAIT cells, which are found in the blood and at mucosal and other organ sites, have yet to be examined in the context of VZV infection. The goal of this study was to examine any direct impact of VZV on MAIT cells.
METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we interrogated whether primary blood derived MAIT cells are permissive to infection by VZV whilst further analysing differential levels of infection between various MAIT cell subpopulations. Changes in cell surface extravasation, skin homing, activation and proliferation markers after VZV infection of MAIT cells was also assessed via flow cytometry. Finally the capacity of MAIT cells to transfer infectious virus was tested through an infectious center assay and imaged via fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: We identify primary blood-derived MAIT cells as being permissive to VZV infection. A consequence of VZV infection of MAIT cells was their capacity to transfer infectious virus to other permissive cells, consistent with MAIT cells supporting productive infection. When subgrouping MAIT cells by their co- expression of a variety cell surface markers, there was a higher proportion of VZV infected MAIT cells co-expressing CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ MAIT cells compared to the more phenotypically dominant CD8+ MAIT cells, whereas infection was not associated with differences in co-expression of CD56 (MAIT cell subset with enhanced responsiveness to innate cytokine stimulation), CD27 (co-stimulatory) or PD-1 (immune checkpoint). Infected MAIT cells retained high expression of CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, CLA and CCR4, indicating a potentially intact capacity for transendothelial migration, extravasation and trafficking to skin sites. Infected MAIT cells also displayed increased expression of CD69 (early activation) and CD71 (proliferation) markers.
DISCUSSION: These data identify MAIT cells as being permissive to VZV infection and identify impacts of such infection on co- expressed functional markers.","['Purohit SK', 'Corbett AJ', 'Slobedman B', 'Abendroth A']",2023,14,,Front Immunol,"Purohit SK, et al.

36997920,Is Guillain-Barre syndrome following chickenpox a parainfectious disease? A case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Polyradiculoneuropathy following infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) is rare and most of the time, happens in the context of reactivation of latent VZV. We report a case of acute polyradiculoneuropathy following primary infection with VZV marked by atypical clinical features raising the hypothesis of a para-infectious disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 43-years-old male who developed ataxia, dysphagia, dysphonia, and oculomotor disorders (vertical binocular diplopia and bilateral ptosis) followed by quadriplegia with areflexia which occurred 4 days later. The patient had a history of varicella that occurred 10 days before the onset of these symptoms. Nerve conduction study revealed features consistent with an acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative. Based on clinical presentation and ancillary examination, we retain the Miller Fisher/Guillain-Barré overlap syndrome diagnosis. The patient was treated with high doses of methylprednisolone but the evolution of the disease was nevertheless marked by a complete recovery six weeks after onset of symptoms.
CONCLUSION: GBS following varicella is a rare but severe disease occurring most often in adults and marked by greater involvement of the cranial nerves. Its clinical features suggest that it is a para-infectious disease. Antiviral therapy has no effect on the course of the disease but its administration within the first 24 h after the onset of chickenpox in adults can prevent its occurrence.","['Ido BJF', 'Guebre SM', 'Carama EA', 'Dabilgou AA', 'Napon C']",2023,23,1,BMC Neurol,"Ido BJF, et al.

Multiple stressors could act individually or synergistically which results in small to large scale tissue degradation, reduced coral covers, and makes the corals vulnerable to various diseases. The coralline diseases are like the Chicken pox in humans because they spread hastily throughout the coral ecosystem and can devastate the coral cover formed over centuries in an abbreviated time. The extinction of the entire reef ecosystem will alter the ocean and earth's amalgam of biogeochemical cycles causing a threat to the entire planet.

36972249,Systematic review of economic evaluations of varicella vaccination programmes.,"OBJECTIVES: This study carried out a systematic literature review of economic evaluations of varicella vaccination programmes from the earliest publication to the present day, including programmes in the workplace and in special risk groups as well as universal childhood vaccination and catch up programmes.
METHODS: Articles published from 1985 until 2022 were sourced from PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, NHSEED and Econlit. Eligible economic evaluations, which included posters and conference abstracts, were identified by two reviewers who scrutinised each other's selections at both title and abstract and full report stages. The studies are described in terms of their methodological characteristics. Their results are aggregated by type of vaccination programme and the nature of the economic outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 2575 articles were identified of which 79 qualified as economic evaluations. A total of 55 studies focused on universal childhood vaccination, 10 on the workplace and 14 on high risk groups. Twenty-seven studies reported estimates of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, 16 reported benefit-cost ratios, 20 reported cost-effectiveness outcomes in terms of incremental cost per event or life saved and 16 reported cost-cost offset results. Most studies of universal childhood vaccination reported an increase in overall costs to health services, but often a reduction in cost from a societal perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence surrounding the cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination programmes remains sparse with contrasting conclusions in some areas. Future research should particularly aim to encompass the impact of universal childhood vaccination programmes on herpes zoster among adults.","['Anderson R', 'Kim S', 'Roberts N', 'Petrou S']",2023,18,3,PLoS One,"Anderson R, et al.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between acute respiratory infections during the first trimester of pregnancy and congenital anomalies in babies using record linkage.
METHODS: We linked a perinatal register to hospitalisation and disease notifications in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) between 2001 to 2016. We quantified the risk of congenital anomalies, identified from the babies' linked hospital record in relation to notifiable respiratory and other infections during pregnancy using generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) adjusted for maternal sociodemographic and other characteristics.
RESULTS: Of 1,453,037 birth records identified from the perinatal register between 2001 and 2016, 11,710 (0.81%) mothers were hospitalised for acute respiratory infection, 2850 (0.20%) had influenza and 1011 (0.07%) had high risk infections (a record of cytomegalovirus, rubella, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, chickenpox (varicella) and zika) during the pregnancy. During the first trimester, acute respiratory infection, influenza and high-risk infections were reported by 1547 (0.11%), 399 (0.03%) and 129 (0.01%) mothers. There were 15,644 (1.08%) babies reported with major congenital anomalies, 2242 (0.15%) with cleft lip/ plate, 7770 (0.53%) with all major cardiovascular anomalies and 1746 (0.12%) with selected major cardiovascular anomalies. The rate of selected major cardiovascular anomalies was significantly higher if the mother had an acute respiratory infection during the first trimester of pregnancy (AOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.73 to 7.66). The rates of all major congenital anomalies and all major cardiovascular anomalies were also higher if the mother had an acute respiratory infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, however the difference was no statistically significant. Influenza during the first trimester was not associated with major congenital anomalies, selected major cardiovascular anomalies or all major cardiovascular anomalies in this study.
CONCLUSION: This large population-based study found severe acute respiratory infection in first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of selected major cardiovascular anomalies in babies. These findings support measures to prevent acute respiratory infections in pregnant women including through vaccination.","['Chughtai AA', 'He WQ', 'Liu B']",2023,23,1,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,"Chughtai AA, et al.

36952124,Over 90% of Childhood BCG Vaccine-Induced Keloids in Japan Occur in Women.,"INTRODUCTION: Keloids are a fibroproliferative, multifactorial, cutaneous disorder whose pathophysiology is not completely understood. Various factors such as high blood pressure, pregnancy, female gender, mechanical tension of local sites, and prolonged wound healing are known to worsen keloids. Childhood-onset keloids are keloids that form before 10 years of age, before various factors in adulthood come into play, and thus studying childhood-onset keloids may provide additional insight into the underlying mechanisms that lead to keloid formation.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with childhood-onset keloids who were evaluated at our plastic surgery clinic (one of the largest keloid referral centers in Japan) over a 1-year period.
RESULTS: Of the 1443 patients with diagnosis of keloids, 131 patients had childhood-onset keloids. Of these, 106 patients (80.9%) were female, 38.9% of patients had family history of keloids, and 48.9% of patients had allergies or allergy-related conditions (asthma, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis). Vaccination (47.5%) and chickenpox (19.9%) were the most common triggers. Of vaccinations, BCG was the most common trigger. The majority of keloids from BCG were in female patients (92.9%). The most common location was the chest in male patients (30.0%) and the arm in female patients (41.1%).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest report in the literature on childhood-onset keloids. There was overall female predominance in childhood-onset keloids, and even more significant female predominance in BCG-induced keloids.","['Noishiki C', 'Hayasaka Y', 'Yoshida R', 'Ogawa R']",2023,13,5,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),"Noishiki C, et al.

36949170,Pediatric herpes zoster ophthalmicus: a systematic review.,"PURPOSE: While typically affecting older adults and immunocompromised individuals, herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) has been reported with varying manifestations and complications in children. In this review, we evaluate reported cases of pediatric HZO in the literature and discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes.
METHODS: A literature search on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was performed using the terms ""pediatric herpes zoster ophthalmicus"" and ""herpes zoster ophthalmicus children."" Publications that were not specific to HZO or pediatric populations were excluded, as were publications that were not available to review or not published in the English language.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven reports describing 130 cases of HZO or HZO-related complications were reviewed. Major risk factors for pediatric HZO included intrauterine exposure to varicella or primary varicella infection at a young age; HZO also occurred in patients who had received varicella vaccination. Both healthy and immunocompromised children were affected, with the majority of affected children being immunocompetent. The diagnosis of HZO is primarily clinical. Children appear to have good vision recovery and resolution of symptoms if they are treated promptly and if they adhere to treatment regimens, except for irreversible vision loss related to uncommon complications such as optic neuritis.
CONCLUSION: HZO occurs in both healthy and immunocompromised children. Recognizing this treatable condition is essential for reducing ocular and systemic morbidity. Long-term follow-up and assessments of the impact on health in adulthood are lacking. More systematic study is needed to determine the incidence of HZO in children and appropriate diagnostic and treatment protocols for the care of pediatric patients with HZO.","['Hakim FE', 'Riaz K', 'Farooq A']",2023,261,8,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,"Hakim FE, et al.

Yet, this did not stop other researchers from employing it to build Machine Learning (ML) solutions aimed at computer-aided diagnosis of Monkeypox and other viral infections presenting skin lesions. Neither did it stop the reviewers or editors from publishing these subsequent works in peer-reviewed journals. Several of these works claimed extraordinary performance in the classification of Monkeypox, Chickenpox and Measles, employing ML and the aforementioned dataset. In this work, we analyse the initiator work that has catalysed the development of several ML solutions, and whose popularity is continuing to grow.

36921204,"Factors associated with incomplete vaccination and negative antibody test results for measles, mumps, and hepatitis A among children followed in the MINA-BRAZIL cohort.","Vaccination coverage has been dropping in Brazil and other countries. In addition, immune responses after vaccination may not be homogeneous, varying according to sociodemographic and clinical factors. Understanding the determinants of incomplete vaccination and negative antibody test results may contribute to the development of strategies to improve vaccination effectiveness. In this study, we aimed to investigate the frequency of vaccine adherence, factors associated with incomplete vaccination for measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and hepatitis A, and factors associated with the seronegative test results for measles, mumps and hepatitis A at 2 years of age. This was a population-based cohort that addressed health conditions and mother/infant nutrition in Cruzeiro do Sul city, Brazil. Vaccination data were obtained from official certificates of immunization. The children underwent blood collection at the two-year-old follow-up visit; the samples were analyzed using commercially available kits to measure seropositivity for measles, mumps, and hepatitis A. We used modified Poisson regression models adjusted for covariates to identify factors associated with incomplete vaccination and negative serology after vaccination. Out of the 825 children included in the study, adherence to the vaccine was 90.6% for MMR, 76.7% for the MMRV (MMR + varicella), and 74.9% for the hepatitis A vaccine. For MMR, after the adjustment for covariates, factors associated with incomplete vaccination included: white-skinned mother; paid maternity leave; raising more than one child; lower number of antenatal consultations; and attending childcare. For hepatitis A, the factors included: white-skinned mother and not having a cohabiting partner. The factors with statistically significant association with a negative antibody test result included: receiving Bolsa Familia allowance for measles and mumps; incomplete vaccination for measles; and vitamin A deficiency for mumps. Strategies to improve the efficiency of vaccine programs are urgently needed. These include improvements in communication about vaccine safety and efficacy, and amplification of access to primary care facilities, prioritizing children exposed to the sociodemographic factors identified in this study.

Cutaneous manifestations including erythematous rash, urticaria, and chickenpox-like vesicles have been described in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Six patients, two men and four women, in the age group of 50 to 60 years old, hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) presented cutaneous manifestations. The rash was confluent, spotty, centrifugal, and non-itchy on the head and torso. It was not hemorrhagic, and no crust or blisters were observed. The results of laboratory tests were normal, and the rash disappeared on its own. Several cases of cutaneous manifestations have been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

36906077,Poxes great and small: The stories behind their names.,"The word ""pox"" indicated, during the late 15th century, a disease characterized by eruptive sores. When an outbreak of syphilis began in Europe during that time, it was called by many names, including the French term ""la grosse verole"" (""the great pox""), to distinguish it from smallpox, which was termed ""la petite verole"" (""the small pox""). Chickenpox was initially confused with smallpox until 1767, when the English physician William Heberden (1710-1801) provided a detailed description of chickenpox, differentiating it from smallpox. The cowpox virus was used by Edward Jenner (1749-1823) to develop a successful vaccine against smallpox. He devised the term ""variolae vaccinae"" (""smallpox of the cow"") to denote cowpox. Jenner's pioneering work on a smallpox vaccine has led to the eradication of this disease and opened the way to preventing other infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, a poxvirus that is closely related to smallpox and that is currently infecting persons around the world. This contribution tells the stories behind the names of the various ""poxes"" that have infected humans: the great pox (syphilis), smallpox, chickenpox, cowpox, and monkeypox. These infectious diseases not only share a common ""pox"" nomenclature, but are also closely interconnected in medical history.","['Czinn AB', 'Hoenig LJ']",2023,,,Clin Dermatol,Czinn AB and Hoenig LJ.

36899968,Application of Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Monkeypox: A Systematic Review.,"Monkeypox or Mpox is an infectious virus predominantly found in Africa. It has spread to many countries since its latest outbreak. Symptoms such as headaches, chills, and fever are observed in humans. Lumps and rashes also appear on the skin (similar to smallpox, measles, and chickenpox). Many artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for accurate and early diagnosis. In this work, we systematically reviewed recent studies that used AI for mpox-related research. After a literature search, 34 studies fulfilling prespecified criteria were selected with the following subject categories: diagnostic testing of mpox, epidemiological modeling of mpox infection spread, drug and vaccine discovery, and media risk management. In the beginning, mpox detection using AI and various modalities was described. Other applications of ML and DL in mitigating mpox were categorized later. The various machine and deep learning algorithms used in the studies and their performance were discussed. We believe that a state-of-the-art review will be a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists in developing measures to counter the mpox virus and its spread.","['Chadaga K', 'Prabhu S', 'Sampathila N', 'Nireshwalya S', 'Katta SS', 'Tan RS', 'Acharya UR']",2023,13,5,Diagnostics (Basel),"Chadaga K, et al.

36899617,Seasonal transmission dynamics of varicella in Japan: The role of temperature and school holidays.,"In Japan, major and minor bimodal seasonal patterns of varicella have been observed. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of seasonality, we evaluated the effects of the school term and temperature on the incidence of varicella in Japan. We analyzed epidemiological, demographic and climate datasets of seven prefectures in Japan. We fitted a generalized linear model to the number of varicella notifications from 2000 to 2009 and quantified the transmission rates as well as the force of infection, by prefecture. To evaluate the effect of annual variation in temperature on the rate of transmission, we assumed a threshold temperature value. In northern Japan, which has large annual temperature variations, a bimodal pattern in the epidemic curve was observed, reflecting the large deviation in average weekly temperature from the threshold value. This bimodal pattern was diminished with southward prefectures, gradually shifting to a unimodal pattern in the epidemic curve, with little temperature deviation from the threshold. The transmission rate and force of infection, considering the school term and temperature deviation from the threshold, exhibited similar seasonal patterns, with a bimodal pattern in the north and a unimodal pattern in the south. Our findings suggest the existence of preferable temperatures for varicella transmission and an interactive effect of the school term and temperature. Investigating the potential impact of temperature elevation that could reshape the epidemic pattern of varicella to become unimodal, even in the northern part of Japan, is required.","['Suzuki A', 'Nishiura H']",2023,20,2,Math Biosci Eng,Suzuki A and Nishiura H.

36890995,Vaccine hesitancy among Ukrainian refugees.,"BACKGROUND: On February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. Beyond Poland, Romania, Russia, several refugees reached Italy also. In the past, several factors contributed to low vaccination coverage in Ukraine and the occurrence of epidemic outbreaks. The purpose of our study was to analyze the main characteristics of Ukrainian refugees who accessed the Rozzano Vaccination Center (Italy), and the attitude towards proposed vaccinations.
METHODS: In March-July 2022, we conducted a cross-sectional study on Ukrainian refugees under the age of 18. On the basis of their vaccination certificates or antibody dosages, the doctor proposed to the parents (or legal guardians) any vaccinations to be carried out on the basis of the Italian childhood vaccination schedule. Refused or accepted vaccinations were registered and the data exported for statistical analysis. COVID-19 vaccination was excluded from the analysis.
RESULTS: 27 refugees missed the appointment, so 79 Ukrainian refugees have been included in the study. Females represented the 51.90% of patients; the average age was 7.11 (sd 4.92) years. The most refused vaccinations were: HPV, MMR and men C. Significant differences due to age were found for Men C and Chickenpox acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS: The efforts made to ensure complete care and to promote vaccination among refugees, offering them a complete evaluation of the vaccination status and the possibility of being vaccinated for free, seem to be insufficient to convince most refugees to get vaccinated.","['Troiano G', 'Torchia G', 'Nardi A']",2022,63,4,J Prev Med Hyg,"Troiano G, et al.

Epidemiological and clinical data were collected from patients' hospital records. A total of 467 cases were identified. Incidence has increased from 2.1 to 10.9/100,000 inhabitants between 2009 and 2019 in non-homeless adults while it was above 100/100,000 on homeless in years with available denominators. Most of GAS were isolated from blood (43.6%), and the most common clinical presentation was skin and soft tissue infections (42.8%). A third of all the patients needed surgery, a quarter was admitted to the intensive care unit, and 10% of the adult patients died. Wounds and chickenpox disease were the main risk factors for children. Tobacco, alcohol abuse, wounds or chronic skin lesion, being homeless, and diabetes were identified as major predisposing factors for adults. The most common emm clusters were D4, E4, and AC3; 64% of the isolates were theoretically covered by the 30-valent M-protein vaccine. The burden of invasive and probable invasive GAS infections is on the rise in the studied adult population.

36859731,The impact of patient skin colour on diagnostic ability and confidence of medical students.,"Previous literature has explored unconscious racial biases in clinical education and medicine, finding that people with darker skin tones can be underrepresented in learning resources and managed differently in a clinical setting. This study aimed to examine whether patient skin colour can affect the diagnostic ability and confidence of medical students, and their cognitive reasoning processes. We presented students with 12 different clinical presentations on both white skin (WS) and non-white skin (NWS). A think aloud (TA) study was conducted to explore students' cognitive reasoning processes (n = 8). An online quiz was also conducted where students submitted a diagnosis and confidence level for each clinical presentation (n = 185). In the TA interviews, students used similar levels of information gathering and analytical reasoning for each skin type but appeared to display increased uncertainty and reduced non-analytical reasoning methods for the NWS images compared to the WS images. In the online quiz, students were significantly more likely to accurately diagnose five of the 12 clinical presentations (shingles, cellulitis, Lyme disease, eczema and meningococcal disease) on WS compared to NWS (p < 0.01). With regards to students' confidence, they were significantly more confident diagnosing eight of the 12 clinical presentations (shingles, cellulitis, Lyme disease, eczema, meningococcal disease, urticaria, chickenpox and Kawasaki disease) on WS when compared to NWS (p < 0.01). These findings highlight the need to improve teaching resources to include a greater diversity of skin colours exhibiting clinical signs, to improve students' knowledge and confidence, and ultimately, to avoid patients being misdiagnosed due to the colour of their skin.","['Dodd RV', 'Rafi D', 'Stackhouse AA', 'Brown CA', 'Westacott RJ', 'Meeran K', 'Hughes E', 'Wilkinson P', 'Gurnell M', 'Swales C', 'Sam AH']",2023,,,Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract,"Dodd RV, et al.

36851652,Herpes Simplex Virus and Varicella Zoster Virus Infections in Cancer Patients.,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) are alpha herpesviruses that establish life-long latent infection in neuronal ganglia after primary infection. Periodic reactivation of these viruses results in recurrent infections that can have significant impact on patients' quality of life. HSV commonly causes oral and genital mucocutaneous infections whereas VZV is responsible for varicella/chickenpox and herpes zoster/shingles, but cancer patients are at particularly higher risk of complications including disseminated and visceral infections due to impaired cell-mediated immunity. While diagnosis of more common HSV and/or VZV infections is frequently clinically based, immunocompromised hosts may have atypical skin presentation or visceral involvement. Thus, diagnostic confirmation using virus-specific tests such as polymerase chain reaction or immunohistochemical staining is crucial in some cases. Oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir are usually used for mild to moderate infections and intravenous acyclovir is the drug of choice for severe or disseminated infections. Foscarnet can be used when acyclovir-resistance is confirmed or suspected. Pharmaceutical prophylaxis against HSV and/or VZV should be considered in high-risk cancers patients. Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine against HSV, but VZV vaccines are available to prevent varicella and zoster.","['Tayyar R', 'Ho D']",2023,15,2,Viruses,Tayyar R and Ho D.

36809673,"Accounting for Adverse Events Following Immunization in Economic Evaluation: Systematic Review of Economic Evaluations of Pediatric Vaccines Against Pneumococcus, Rotavirus, Human Papillomavirus, Meningococcus and Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella.","OBJECTIVES: Economic evaluations of vaccines should accurately represent all relevant economic and health consequences of vaccination, including losses due to adverse events following immunization (AEFI). We investigated to what extent economic evaluations of pediatric vaccines account for AEFI, which methods are used to do so and whether inclusion of AEFI is associated with study characteristics and the vaccine's safety profile.
METHODS: A systematic literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews and Trials, Database of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination of the University of York, EconPapers, Paediatric Economic Database Evaluation, Tufts New England Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, Tufts New England Global Health CEA, International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment Database) was performed for economic evaluations published between 2014 and 29 April 2021 (date of search) pertaining to the five groups of pediatric vaccines licensed in Europe and the United States since 1998: the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, the meningococcal vaccines (MCV), the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) combination vaccines, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) and the rotavirus vaccines (RV). Rates of accounting for AEFI were calculated, stratified by study characteristics (e.g., region, publication year, journal impact factor, level of industry involvement) and triangulated with the vaccine's safety profile (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] recommendations and information on safety-related product label changes). The studies accounting for AEFI were analyzed in terms of the methods used to account for both cost and effect implications of AEFI.
RESULTS: We identified 112 economic evaluations, of which 28 (25%) accounted for AEFI. This proportion was significantly higher for MMRV (80%, four out of five evaluations), MCV (61%, 11 out of 18 evaluations) and RV (60%, nine out of 15 evaluations) compared to HPV (6%, three out of 53 evaluations) and PCV (5%, one out of 21 evaluations). No other study characteristics were associated with a study's likelihood of accounting for AEFI. Vaccines for which AEFI were more frequently accounted for also had a higher frequency of label changes and a higher level of attention to AEFI in ACIP recommendations. Nine studies accounted for both the cost and health implications of AEFI, 18 studies considered only costs and one only health outcomes. While the cost impact was usually estimated based on routine billing data, the adverse health impact of AEFI was usually estimated based on assumptions.
DISCUSSION: Although (mild) AEFI were demonstrated for all five studied vaccines, only a quarter of reviewed studies accounted for these, mostly in an incomplete and inaccurate manner. We provide guidance on which methods to use to better quantify the impact of AEFI on both costs and health outcomes. Policymakers should be aware that the impact of AEFI on cost-effectiveness is likely to be underestimated in the majority of economic evaluations.","['Doggen K', 'van Hoek AJ', 'Luyten J']",2023,41,5,Pharmacoeconomics,"Doggen K, et al.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occur during the attenuation of parental strains are critical indicators of vaccine safety. To assess the attenuation of commercial VZV vaccines, genetic variants were comprehensively examined through high-throughput sequencing of viral DNA isolated from four VZV vaccines (Barycela, VarilRix, VariVax, and SKY Varicella). Whole-genome comparison of the four vaccines with the wild-type strain (Dumas) revealed that the sequences are highly conserved on a genome-wide scale. Among the 196 common variants across the four vaccines, 195 were already present in the genome of the parental strain (pOka), indicating that the variants occurred during the generation of the parental strain from the Dumas strain. Compared to the pOka genome, the vaccines exhibited distinct variant frequencies on a genome-wide and within an attenuation-related open reading frame. In particular, attenuation-associated 42 SNPs showed that Barycela, VarilRix, VariVax, and SKY Varicella are in ascending order regarding similarity with pOka-like genotypes, which in turn, might provide genomic evidence for the levels of attenuation. Finally, the phylogenetic network analysis demonstrated that genetic distances from the parental strain correlated with the attenuation levels of the vaccines.","['Moon JY', 'Seo J', 'Lee J', 'Park D']",2023,95,3,J Med Virol,"Moon JY, et al.

DESIGN: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey exploring parental attitudes towards vaccines in general, and varicella vaccine specifically, and their preferences for how the vaccine should be administered.
PARTICIPANTS: 596 parents (76.3% female, 23.3% male, 0.4% other; mean age 33.4 years) whose youngest child was aged 0-5 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Willingness to accept the vaccine for their child and preferences for how the vaccine should be administered (in combination with the MMR vaccine [MMRV], on the same day as the MMR vaccine but as a separate injection [MMR + V], on a separate additional visit).
RESULTS: 74.0% of parents (95% CI 70.2% to 77.5%) were extremely/somewhat likely to accept a varicella vaccine for their child if one became available, 18.3% (95% CI 15.3% to 21.8%) were extremely/somewhat unlikely to accept it and 7.7% (95% CI 5.7% to 10.2%) were neither likely nor unlikely. Reasons provided by parents likely to accept the vaccine included protection from complications of chickenpox, trust in the vaccine/healthcare professionals, and wanting their child to avoid their personal experience of chickenpox. Reasons provided by parents who were unlikely included chickenpox not being a serious illness, concern about side effects, and believing it is preferable to catch chickenpox as a child rather than as an adult. A combined MMRV vaccination or additional visit to the surgery were preferred over an additional injection at the same visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Most parents would accept a varicella vaccination.

Direct LAMP of skin swabs was positive in 29 (63.0%) of 46 patients. DermaQuick® VZV was positive in 25 (54.3%) of 46 patients. VZV DNA was detected in only 48.4% of oral swabs with the direct LAMP method. With real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the standard for diagnosing varicella, the sensitivity and specificity of DermaQuick® VZV were 80.7% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of direct LAMP from skin swabs were 93.6% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR for DNA extracted from oral swabs were 74.2% and 93.3%, respectively. Thus, oral swab samples are not suitable for breakthrough varicella diagnosis. Although DermaQuick® VZV is considered the most convenient point-of-care test for varicella, its sensitivity and specificity were lower than those of direct VZV LAMP.","['Higashimoto Y', 'Hattori F', 'Kawamura Y', 'Kozawa K', 'Hamano A', 'Kato M', 'Kato S', 'Hosokawa A', 'Enya Y', 'Ihira M', 'Yoshikawa T']",2023,95,2,J Med Virol,"Higashimoto Y, et al.

Whether such dehiscence in the background of varicella occurred coincidentally or was specifically triggered by the infection is unknown. The treatment is comprised of oral antiviral therapy, surgical wound debridement, and topical application of antiseptic solutions and ointments. We would like to raise awareness of the existence of such a rare case of chickenpox in an early postoperative period of a plastic surgery patient. Thereby, physicians can recognize it, test for it, and treat it promptly and appropriately.

36709460,In Silico Design and Experimental Validation of Novel Oxazole Derivatives Against Varicella zoster virus.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection causes severe disease such as chickenpox, shingles, and postherpetic neuralgia, often leading to disability. Reactivation of latent VZV is associated with a decrease in specific cellular immunity in the elderly and in patients with immunodeficiency. However, due to the limited efficacy of existing therapy and the emergence of antiviral resistance, it has become necessary to develop new and effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of diseases caused by VZV, particularly in the setting of opportunistic infections. The goal of this work is to identify potent oxazole derivatives as anti-VZV agents by machine learning, followed by their synthesis and experimental validation. Predictive QSAR models were developed using the Online Chemical Modeling Environment (OCHEM). Data on compounds exhibiting antiviral activity were collected from the ChEMBL and uploaded in the OCHEM database.

36707826,Two cases of Ramsay-Hunt syndrome following varicella zoster viral meningitis in young immunocompetent men: case reports.,"BACKGROUND: Ramsay-Hunt syndrome (RHS) due to varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection is commonly reported in individuals aged at least 50 years or immunocompromised individuals. VZV infection may invade the central nervous system (CNS) and cause meningitis or encephalitis, which are more likely to occur in patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and chronic renal failure. However, cases with VZV-induced concurrent RHS and CNS infections are rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two young male patients, aged 32 and 43 years, with no underlying disease developed VZV meningitis, followed by RHS involving cranial nerves VII and VIII. Both patients presented with symptoms of peripheral facial palsy, and dizziness accompanied by tinnitus and hearing loss, which appeared several days after the onset of fever and headache. These symptoms were documented as facial neuropathy and sensorineural hearing loss in the electrophysiologic studies. Lymphocyte-dominant pleocytosis and VZV positivity were confirmed from cerebrospinal fluid examination and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The patients were treated with intravenous acyclovir and oral steroids simultaneously. Following the treatment completion, both patients were relieved of their headaches and fever; however, facial palsy, dizziness, and tinnitus persisted. They were followed up at the outpatient clinic.
CONCLUSION: These cases confirmed that RHS and CNS infections can co-exist even in young adults with normal immune function and more importantly, that CNS infection can precede RHS. Since early detection and treatment of RHS improve the prognosis, it is critical to closely monitor patients with VZV meningitis or encephalitis considering the possible superimposition of RHS.","['Hwang YS', 'Kim YS', 'Shin BS', 'Kang HG']",2023,23,1,BMC Neurol,"Hwang YS, et al.

36707120,"Disseminated varicella zoster virus infection following live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine: descriptive analysis of reports to Australia's spontaneous vaccine pharmacovigilance system, 2016-2020.","OBJECTIVES: To examine the reported incidence and features of disseminated varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection following live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine live (ZVL: Zostavax, Merck) in immunocompromised people in Australia.
DESIGN AND SETTING: ZVL was funded in 2016 in Australia for people aged 70 years, with a catch-up programme for those 71-79 years. From 2016 to 2020, three deaths due to disseminated vaccine-strain VZV infection occurred following inadvertent ZVL administration in individuals with varying levels of immunocompromise. This descriptive study examined 4 years of national surveillance data reported to the Therapeutic Goods Administration's Adverse Event Monitoring System (AEMS). Denominator data for rates were from doses recorded in the Australian Immunisation Register.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals vaccinated between 1 November 2016 and 31 December 2020 who experienced adverse event(s) following immunisation (AEFI) after ZVL recorded in the AEMS.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates and outcomes of confirmed (Oka strain positive) or probable disseminated VZV infection, and inadvertent administration of ZVL in immunocompromised individuals.
RESULTS: 854 AEFI were reported from 1 089 966 doses of ZVL administered (78.4 per 100 000 doses). Of those, 14 were classified as confirmed (n=6, 0.55 per 100 000) or probable (n=8) disseminated VZV infection. The confirmed cases were all hospitalised, and most (5/6) were immunocompromised; three cases died. Thirty-seven individuals were reported as vaccinated despite a contraindication due to immunocompromise (3.4 per 100 000), with 12/37 (32%) hospitalised.
CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated VZV is potentially life-threatening and occurs mostly in those with severe immunocompromise. Inadvertent administration of ZVL to immunocompromised individuals has occurred despite initial provider guidance and education. Multiple additional strategies to assist providers to identify contraindications have been implemented to prevent adverse outcomes.","['Li-Kim-Moy J', 'Phillips A', 'Morgan A', 'Glover C', 'Jayasinghe S', 'Hull BP', 'Dey A', 'Beard FH', 'Hickie M', 'Macartney K']",2023,13,1,BMJ Open,"Li-Kim-Moy J, et al.

36690067,"Rapid, sensitive, and specific lateral-flow immunochromatographic point-of-care device for detection of varicella-zoster virus immunoglobulin G antibodies in fingerstick blood.","Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes childhood chickenpox, becomes latent in sensory ganglia and reactivates years later to cause shingles (Zoster) and postherpetic neuralgia in the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals. Serologic IgG tests can be used to determine if a person has antibodies to VZV from past varicella infection or had received varicella or zoster (shingles) vaccination. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are currently used for the detection of VZV IgG antibodies in patient serum samples. However, ELISA tests require collection and processing of blood samples in a CLIA laboratory to separate serum or plasma for further testing. In this paper, we describe the development and testing of an antibody based Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic assay (LFA) device for the detection of VZV IgG in fingerstick whole blood. Analytical and clinical analyses were performed to compare the performance characteristics of the Viro VZV IgG LFA (VZV LFA) and the Diamedix VZV IgG ELISA. Analytical studies demonstrated the higher sensitivity of the VZV LFA compared to the ELISA by testing dilutions of the WHO VZV IgG serum International Standard. Clinical performance characteristics of the VZV LFA fingerstick whole blood assay were assessed at three point of care (POC) facilities by untrained users testing samples from 300 prospectively enrolled study subjects. VZV LFA results were compared with results obtained by testing serum samples obtained from the same study participants by the Diamedix VZV IgG ELISA. Two specimens with invalid results by the LFA assay were not included in the LFA performance calculations and nine equivocal ELISA results were included as positive for IgG results. The results from all three POC clinical sites demonstrated the higher sensitivity/positive percent agreement (PPA) (99.26%, 95% CI: 97.34-99.80) of the VZV LFA compared to the Diamedix VZV IgG ELISA (94.08%, 95% CI: 90.72-96.27). The specificity/negative percent agreement (NPA) of the VZV LFA compared to the ELISA test was calculated initially to be 39.29% (95% CI: 23.57-57.59) with 19 discordant test results out of 298 test results between the two assays (17 LFA positive/ELISA negative and two LFA negative/ELISA positive). The PPA and true NPA of the VZV LFA were determined by testing all 298 samples, including the discordant (19) and all concordant negative and positive (279) study subject serum samples, before and after blocking VZV gE antibody sites in the samples by spiking with VZV LFA gE capture antigen. The NPA improved to 100% (95% CI: 74.12-100) after the procedure when compared to the ELISA test results. The comparator ELISA PPA based on the spiking/blocking study remained as 94.08%, (95% CI: 90.72-96.27), comparable to test results from untreated samples. The VZV LFA has been demonstrated to be simple and sufficiently robust for use in CLIA-waived POC facilities by untrained healthcare professionals and to detect VZV IgG in 20 min from fingerstick whole blood. The VZV LFA therefore provides a fast, reliable, and highly sensitive method of determining prior VZV viral infection or varicella and zoster vaccination status.","['Vafai N', 'Self K', 'Sheffield B', 'Hojvat S', 'Kusi-Appiah A', 'Vaughan P', 'Cowan E', 'Vafai A']",2023,514,,J Immunol Methods,"Vafai N, et al.

36679468,Emerging Methods in Biosensing of Immunoglobin G-A Review.,"Human antibodies are produced due to the activation of immune system components upon exposure to an external agent or antigen. Human antibody G, or immunoglobin G (IgG), accounts for 75% of total serum antibody content. IgG controls several infections by eradicating disease-causing pathogens from the body through complementary interactions with toxins. Additionally, IgG is an important diagnostic tool for certain pathological conditions, such as autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B virus (HBV), chickenpox and MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), and coronavirus-induced disease 19 (COVID-19). As an important biomarker, IgG has sparked interest in conducting research to produce robust, sensitive, selective, and economical biosensors for its detection. To date, researchers have used different strategies and explored various materials from macro- to nanoscale to be used in IgG biosensing. In this review, emerging biosensors for IgG detection have been reviewed along with their detection limits, especially electrochemical biosensors that, when coupled with nanomaterials, can help to achieve the characteristics of a reliable IgG biosensor. Furthermore, this review can assist scientists in developing strategies for future research not only for IgG biosensors but also for the development of other biosensing systems for diverse targets.","['Azam T', 'Bukhari SH', 'Liaqat U', 'Miran W']",2023,23,2,Sensors (Basel),"Azam T, et al.

This viral infection was endemic to the western and central parts of Africa, but has recently spread out of this endemic area to various countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), Portugal, Spain, the United States of America (USA), Canada, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Israel, and Mexico. This is a timely review focusing on recent findings and developments in the epidemiology, clinical features, therapeutic targets, diagnosis, prevention mechanisms, research challenges and possible treatment for Mpox. To date (29 November 2022), there have been around 81,225 reported cases of Mpox. In most cases, this illness is mild; however, there is a fatality rate ranging from 1 to 10%, which might be increased due to associated complications and/or secondary infections. There is a real challenge in the diagnosis of Mpox, since its symptoms are very similar to those of other infections, including smallpox and chickenpox. Generally, to prevent/limit the risk and transmission of Mpox, the detection and isolation of infected individuals, as well as hand hygiene and cleanliness, are essential and effective approaches to control/combat this viral infection. Nevertheless, updated information about Mpox from different angles is lacking. Thus, this review provides updated and comprehensive information about the Mpox illness, which should highlight the global burden, pathogenicity, symptoms, diagnosis, prevention measures and possible treatment of this emerging disease.","['Patel M', 'Adnan M', 'Aldarhami A', 'Bazaid AS', 'Saeedi NH', 'Alkayyal AA', 'Saleh FM', 'Awadh IB', 'Saeed A', 'Alshaghdali K']",2023,13,1,Life (Basel),"Patel M, et al.

36673101,Computer-Aided Detection and Classification of Monkeypox and Chickenpox Lesion in Human Subjects Using Deep Learning Framework.,"Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus. After its recent outbreak, it has become clear that a rapid, accurate, and reliable diagnosis may help reduce the risk of a future outbreak. The presence of skin lesions is one of the most prominent symptoms of the disease. However, this symptom is also peculiar to chickenpox. The resemblance in skin lesions in the human subject may disrupt effective diagnosis and, as a result, lead to misdiagnosis. Such misdiagnosis can lead to the further spread of the disease as it is a communicable disease and can eventually result in an outbreak. As deep learning (DL) algorithms have recently been regarded as a promising technique in medical fields, we have been attempting to integrate a well-trained DL algorithm to assist in the early detection and classification of skin lesions in human subjects. This study used two open-sourced digital skin images for monkeypox and chickenpox. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of four convolutional layers was applied. Afterward, three MaxPooling layers were used after the second, third, and fourth convolutional layers. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our proposed model with state-of-the-art deep-learning models for skin lesions detection. Our proposed CNN model outperformed all DL models with a test accuracy of 99.60%. In addition, a weighted average precision, recall, F1 score of 99.00% was recorded. Subsequently, Alex Net outperformed other pre-trained models with an accuracy of 98.00%. The VGGNet consisting of VGG16 and VGG19 performed least well with an accuracy of 80.00%. Due to the uniqueness of the proposed model and image augmentation techniques applied, the proposed CNN model is generalized and avoids over-fitting. This model would be helpful for the rapid and accurate detection of monkeypox using digital skin images of patients with suspected monkeypox.","['Uzun Ozsahin D', 'Mustapha MT', 'Uzun B', 'Duwa B', 'Ozsahin I']",2023,13,2,Diagnostics (Basel),"Uzun Ozsahin D, et al.

In this study, we developed a dynamic compartment model to explore the optimal schedule for varicella vaccination in Jiangsu Province, China. A susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model was proposed to simulate the transmission of varicella in different age groups. The basic reproduction number was computed by the kinetic model, and the impact of three prevention factors was assessed through the global sensitivity analysis. Finally, the effect of various vaccination scenarios was qualitatively evaluated by numerical simulation. The estimated basic reproduction number was 1.831 ± 0.078, and the greatest contributor was the 5-10 year-old group (0.747 ± 0.042, 40.80%). Sensitivity analysis indicated that there was a strong negative correlation between the second dose vaccination coverage rate and basic reproduction number. In addition, we qualitatively found that the incidence would significantly decrease as the second dose vaccine coverage expands. The results suggest that two-dose varicella vaccination should be mandatory, and the optimal age of second dose vaccination is the 5-10 year-old group. Optimal vaccination time, wide vaccine coverage along with other measures, could enhance the effectiveness of prevention and control of varicella in China.","['Sun X', 'Dai C', 'Wang K', 'Liu Y', 'Jin X', 'Wang C', 'Yin Y', 'Ding Z', 'Lu Z', 'Wang W', 'Wang Z', 'Tang F', 'Wang K', 'Peng Z']",2022,8,1,Trop Med Infect Dis,"Sun X, et al.

36656239,Cold antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia following varicella infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare complication of chicken pox. In adults, such AIHA is due to warm antibodies. We report a case of cold antibody AIHA following chicken pox in a young female.
CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old female presented with clinical and laboratory features consistent with hemolytic anemia 5 days after the onset of chicken pox. Her hemoglobin levels dropped rapidly during the course of admission from 7.9 to 3.8 g/dL with evidence of ongoing haemolysis in the form of rising total and indirect bilirubin. Peripheral smear revealed red cell agglutinates and erythrophagocytosis. Direct Coomb's test (DCT) was positive for C3d suggesting a cold antibody AIHA. Since test for Donath Landsteiner antibody was negative, and all other tests for common causes of hemolytic anemia were noncontributory, it was presumed to be due to chicken pox. The fulminant course necessitated a short course of oral steroids to which she responded with rise in hemoglobin and no further hemolysis. Two weeks later, her peripheral smear was normal and DCT negative.
CONCLUSION: In patients presenting with acute onset anemia following chicken pox, possibility of cold antibody AIHA must be considered and appropriate testing pursued. Despite lack of empiric evidence, short course of steroids may be beneficial if drop in hemoglobin is rapid with evidence of fulminant hemolysis, showing no abatement after first week.","['Carvalho G', ""D'silva A"", 'Chandran P', 'Manuel K', 'Kinglsey', 'Basheer A']",2023,66,1,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,"Carvalho G, et al.

36631357,Anti-varicella-zoster virus antibody titers and seroprotection status from before the first dose of varicella vaccination to before entering elementary school in one region in Japan.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine changes in anti-varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody titers and seroprotection status from before the first dose of vaccination to before 7 years old entering elementary school in children who received the routine two-dose varicella vaccination.
METHODS: Participants were 37 healthy children who received the routine two-dose varicella vaccination at our hospital. A total of five serum samples per child were collected immediately before and 4-6 weeks after each dose of the vaccination and in the year before entry to elementary school. We measured anti-VZV antibody titers by immune adherence hemagglutination (IAHA) method and glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). A positive antibody titer and the seroprotection level were set as ≥2-fold and ≥16-fold, respectively, for IAHA antibody and as ≥50 units and ≥105 units, respectively, for gpELISA-IgG antibody.
RESULTS: The rates of IAHA antibody positivity in the five samples (in order of collection) were 0%, 65%, 38%, 100%, and 59%, and the rates of seroprotection were 0%, 43%, 8%, 100%, and 43%. The rates of gpELISA-IgG antibody positivity were 8%, 81%, 89%, 100%, and 100%, and the rates of seroprotection were 5%, 54%, 70%, 100%, and 89%. The mean IAHA antibody titer and mean gpELISA-IgG antibody titer before entering elementary school were both lower than the respective titers obtained after the second vaccination (both p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Routine two-dose varicella vaccination leads to good antibody production, but titers of acquired antibodies decrease before children enter elementary school.","['Ozaki T', 'Nishimura N', 'Gotoh K', 'Takemoto K']",2023,41,6,Vaccine,"Ozaki T, et al.

36624457,"Cross-cultural diversity analysis: traditional knowledge and uses of freshwater fish species by indigenous peoples of southern Punjab, Pakistan.","BACKGROUND: Fisheries have tremendous cultural and educational importance in human societies. The world is undergoing fast environmental and cultural changes, and local knowledge is being lost. Understanding how people interpret environmental change and develop practices in response to such change is essential to comprehend human resource use. This study was planned with the intent to document and conserve the knowledge about the uses of the freshwater fish fauna among the residents in South Punjab, Pakistan.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were conducted to collect data from informers (N = 88). Principal component analysis, relative frequency citation, fidelity level, relative popularity level, rank-order priority, and similarity index were used to analyze the fish data.
RESULTS: Overall, a total of 43 species of fishes were utilized in the study region, but only 26 species were utilized ethnomedicinally to treat a variety of illnesses such as asthma, body weakness, burn, chicken pox, cold, cough, eyesight, hepatitis, impotence, joint pain, night blindness, skin burn, spleen treatment, stomach infection, and weakness. The uses of fishes were analyzed employing various indices. The highest use value (UV) of 0.86 was calculated for spotted snakehead (Channa punctata), whereas the lowest UV of 0.05 was attained by karail fish (Securicula gora). Moreover, Channa punctata, Cyprinus carpio, Labeo rohita, Oreochromis niloticus, Wallago attu, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Rita rita, Sperata seenghala, Notopterus notopterus, Labeo dyocheilus, Systomus sarana, Puntius punjabensis, Securicula gora, Ompok bimaculatus, and Ompok pabda were the most popular species with RPL = 1.0. Out of the total, 20 species had a ""zero"" similarity index, while the ethnomedicinal use of 12 species (i.e., Labeo dyocheilus, Labeo boggut, Systomus sarana, Puntius punjabensis, Aspidoparia morar, Securicula gora, Crossocheilus diplochilus, Mastacembelus armatus, Ompok bimaculatus, Ompok pabda, Labeo gonius, and Sperata seenghala) was documented for the first time for a variety of diseases (i.e., body weakness, stomach infection, skin burn, joint pain, impotence, asthma, spleen treatment, and chicken pox).
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the local people of the study area hold noteworthy traditional knowledge about the medicinal and cultural uses of fish species. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of active chemicals and in vivo and/or in vitro activities of chemicals derived from ichthyofauna with the highest FC as well as UVs could be interesting for research on new drugs.","['Iqbal KJ', 'Umair M', 'Altaf M', 'Hussain T', 'Ahmad RM', 'Abdeen SMZU', 'Pieroni A', 'Abbasi AM', 'Ali S', 'Ashraf S', 'Amjad N', 'Khan AM', 'Bussmann RW']",2023,19,1,J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,"Iqbal KJ, et al.

This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of co-administration with live attenuated varicella vaccine (VarV) and inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) among children aged 12 ~ 15 months. In this phase 4 clinical trial, 450 children were randomized with a ratio of 1:1 to receive VarV and Hep A simultaneously (Group A) or separately (Group B). The primary endpoints were the seroconversion rate of anti-varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies 42 days after vaccination of VarV and the seroconversion rate of anti-Hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibodies 30 days after two-dose vaccination of HepA. After full immunization, the seroconversion rates of anti-VZV antibodies were 91.79% in Group A and 92.15% in Group B; the geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 11.80 and 12.19, respectively. The seroconversion rates of anti-HAV antibodies were 99.48% in Group A and 100.0% in Group B; the geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) reached 9499.11 and 9528.36 mIU/ml, respectively. The lower limits of the 95% CI for the seroconversion difference of anti-VZV antibodies and anti-HAV antibodies were -5.86% and -2.90%, which greater than the predefined non-inferiority margin (-10%). The incidence rate of adverse reactions in Group A was lower than Group B (9.33% vs 16.22%), and only one serious adverse event was reported in Group B, which was unrelated to the study vaccine. In conclusion, the co-administration of VarV with HepA has non-inferior immunogenicity and safety profiles were quite comparable with the separate administration of both vaccines.","['Sun D', 'Yu D', 'Du Z', 'Jia N', 'Liu X', 'Sun J', 'Xu Q', 'Sun Z', 'Luan C', 'Lv J', 'Xiong P', 'Zhang L', 'Sha X', 'Gao Y', 'Kang D']",2023,19,1,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Sun D, et al.

36577762,Prevalence of infectious diseases in preterm infants: a 2-year follow-up from the Japan Environment and Children's Study.,"Evidence regarding the long-term risk of infections in preterm infants is lacking. In this study, we examined whether preterm infants developed various common childhood infections more frequently than full-term infants by the age of 2 years by analyzing data from a questionnaire completed by 67,282 mother-toddler pairs in a nationwide birth cohort study. Of the target population, 2885 (4.3%) were born prematurely. After covariate adjustment for maternal and children factors, lower respiratory tract infections appeared more frequent in preterm than in full-term infants at both 1 and 2 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.41, and aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.46, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in the frequencies of lower respiratory tract infection between preterm and full-term infants after Palivizumab administration. The risk of other common infections, such as in the upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, herpangina, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, chickenpox, influenza virus, and adenovirus infections, was not higher in preterm than in full-term infants after covariates adjustment for maternal and children factors. These findings suggest Palivizumab prophylaxis could reduce the frequencies of lower respiratory tract infection in preterm to the same level as in full-term infants.","['Tamura K', 'Matsumura K', 'Tsuchida A', 'Yoshida T', 'Inadera H', 'Japan Environment and Children’s Study (JECS) Group']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Tamura K, et al.

36571518,"[Monkeypox: Epidemiological surveillance in the Muñiz Outpatient Monitoring Unit, Buenos Aires].","INTRODUCTION: Monkeypox (SV) is a zoonotic viral disease. Monkeypox virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family. In 1970 it was detected for the first time in humans, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is currently considered an endemic disease in central and western Africa. It can present with fever, malaise, painful lymphadenopathy and rash, and last between 2 and 4 weeks. It is usually selflimited, although severe cases have been described, mainly in immunocompromised people, with lethality varies between 3% and 6% in endemic countries. The objectives of epidemiological surveillance in suspected cases of SV are: to describe the personal variables, time and place of the reported cases, to track and follow up their contacts, to identify outbreaks and perform clinical epidemiological follow-up.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from June 9 to September 15, 2022.
RESULTS: 82 patients with compatible symptoms have been treated, 56 cases were positive and 26 negative. Of the 26 negative cases, 7 cases (27%) corresponded to chickenpox, 4 cases (15%) to syphilis, and 2 cases (8%) to herpes zoster.
CONCLUSIONS: The first symptoms began two to five days prior to consultation, the most frequent being fever, myalgia, asthenia, headache, and painful lymphadenopathy. Epidemiological surveillance of SV provides timely detection of cases, continuous and systematic follow-up of contacts through an integrated process between surveillance and laboratory, to generate timely, valid and reliable information, which allows guiding prevention and control measures.","['Sánchez Doncell J', 'Sotelo CA', 'Braga I', 'Francos JL', 'Romano M', 'Gonzalez Montaner P']",2022,82,6,Medicina (B Aires),"Sánchez Doncell J, et al.

36560823,Recombinant Simian Varicella Virus-Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Vaccine Induces T and B Cell Functions and Provides Partial Protection against Repeated Mucosal SIV Challenges in Rhesus Macaques.,"HIV vaccine mediated efficacy, using an expanded live attenuated recombinant varicella virus-vectored SIV rSVV-SIVgag/env vaccine prime with adjuvanted SIV-Env and SIV-Gag protein boosts, was evaluated in a female rhesus macaques (RM) model against repeated intravaginal SIV challenges. Vaccination induced anti-SIV IgG responses and neutralizing antibodies were found in all vaccinated RMs. Three of the eight vaccinated RM remained uninfected (vaccinated and protected, VP) after 13 repeated challenges with the pathogenic SIVmac251-CX-1. The remaining five vaccinated and infected (VI) macaques had significantly reduced plasma viral loads compared with the infected controls (IC). A significant increase in systemic central memory CD4+ T cells and mucosal CD8+ effector memory T-cell responses was detected in vaccinated RMs compared to controls. Variability in lymph node SIV-Gag and Env specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cytokine responses were detected in the VI RMs while all three VP RMs had more durable cytokine responses following vaccination and prior to challenge. VI RMs demonstrated predominately SIV-specific monofunctional cytokine responses while the VP RMs generated polyfunctional cytokine responses. This study demonstrates that varicella virus-vectored SIV vaccination with protein boosts induces a 37.5% efficacy rate against pathogenic SIV challenge by generating mucosal memory, virus specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies, and polyfunctional T-cell responses.","['Pahar B', 'Gray W', 'Fahlberg M', 'Grasperge B', 'Hunter M', 'Das A', 'Mabee C', 'Aye PP', 'Schiro F', 'Hensley K', 'Ratnayake A', 'Goff K', 'LaBranche C', 'Shen X', 'Tomaras GD', 'DeMarco CT', 'Montefiori D', 'Kissinger P', 'Marx PA', 'Traina-Dorge V']",2022,14,12,Viruses,"Pahar B, et al.

36560805,Reassessment of Evidence about Coinfection of Chickenpox and Monkeypox (Mpox) in African Children.,"In west and central Africa, monkeypox occurs mainly in older children, adolescents and young adults. In two large epidemiology studies of monkeypox outbreaks, the investigators observed a sizable number of coinfections of chickenpox (varicella) and monkeypox. Based on a review of the literature, we propose that chickenpox (human herpesvirus-3 infection) is a risk factor for acquisition of monkeypox infection. Our hypothesis states that the chickenpox skin lesion provides an entry site for the monkeypox virus, which is harbored on a fomite in the environment of the patient. The fact that monkeypox can enter via a scratch or abrasion is a known mechanism of spread for three other poxviruses, including mousepox (ectromelia), orf and molluscum contagiosum. There are many similarities in pathogenesis between certain poxviruses and chickenpox, including a viremia with a cellular stress response leading to high levels of the IL-6 cytokine. One very revealing observation in the two epidemiology studies was that the number of pox as well as the severity of disease in children with chickenpox and monkeypox coinfection was not greater than found in children with monkeypox alone. Based on the above observations, we conclude that, when chickenpox precedes monkeypox, priming of the immune system by the earlier chickenpox infection moderates the severity of the secondary infection with monkeypox. This conclusion also has important public health implications about chickenpox surveillance.","['Khallafallah O', 'Grose C']",2022,14,12,Viruses,Khallafallah O and Grose C.

36552964,Rapid Detection of the Varicella-Zoster Virus Using a Recombinase-Aided Amplification-Lateral Flow System.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). VZV infections are ubiquitous and highly contagious, and diagnosis is mostly based on the assessment of signs and symptoms. However, monkeypox, an emerging infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), has clinical manifestations that are similar to those of VZV infections. With the recent monkeypox outbreak in non-endemic regions, VZV infections are likely to be misdiagnosed in the absence of laboratory testing. Considering the lack of accessible diagnostic tests that discriminate VZV from MPXV or other poxviruses, a handy and affordable detection system for VZV is crucial for rapid differential diagnosis. Here, we developed a new detection method for VZV using recombinase-aided amplification technology, combined with the lateral flow system (RAA-LF). Given the prevalence of VZV worldwide, this method can be applied not only to distinguish VZV from other viruses causing rash, but also to foster early detection, contributing substantially to disease control.","['Bienes KM', 'Mao L', 'Selekon B', 'Gonofio E', 'Nakoune E', 'Wong G', 'Berthet N']",2022,12,12,Diagnostics (Basel),"Bienes KM, et al.

36546403,Mendelian randomization study on the causal effect of chickenpox on dementia.,"Some viruses, such as varicella zoster virus, are associated with severe dementia. The present study aims to identify the causal link between chickenpox and dementia. To date, the largest publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) for chickenpox (710 cases and 211 856 controls from European individuals) and for dementia (5933 cases and 212 859 controls from European individuals) were used to performed this two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. We found no significant pleiotropy or heterogeneity in all seven selected chickenpox genetic instrumental variants in dementia GWAS. Of seven chickenpox genetic variants, two are located in the intergenic region and five are located in intron. We found that as chickenpox genetically increased, dementia risk increased based on an inverse-variance weighted analysis (β = 0.070, 95% confidence interval [CI] for β: 0.014-0.126; odds ratio [OR] = 1.073, 95% CI for OR: 1.015-1.134; p = 0.014) and weighted median (β = 0.071, 95% CI for β: 0.002-0.141; OR = 1.074, 95% CI for OR: 1.002-1.152; p = 0.045).

36533765,"When a neglected tropical disease goes global: early estimates from the Monkeypox outbreak, the first 1,054 cases.","Monkeypox virus (MPXV), genus Orthopoxvirus, is a large double-stranded DNA virus (200-250 nm), that is evolutionarily related to human variola virus (VARV) (1), and causes a clinical syndrome quite similar to smallpox, with a generally less severe outcome (1,2). MPXV has a wide range of hosts and reservoirs in wild animals, and since 1970 has been commonly acknowledged as a human pathogen, endemic to Central and Western African countries through two distinctive clades (2,3). Central African clade (CAC) is responsible of the majority of 20,000 incident cases of the last decade, with a case-fatality-ratio of 7-10%, compared to < 4% for Western African clade (WAC) (4). In 2003, the importation of infected pests (Cynomys spp, i.e. ""prairie dogs"") to United Stated resulted in the first MPXV-WAC outbreak out of Africa, involving a total of 81 human cases, with no documented deaths (5). In the next decade, the spreading of the MPVX-WAC to Nigeria, has then resulted in multiple travel-related cases in non-endemic countries (4,6). Since May 7th, 2022, an unprecedented outbreak of MPXV-WAC infections with around 1,051 documented cases (Table 1) is occurring across Europe (89.7% of cases), Americas (10.7%), and Australia (0.6%), mostly occurring in subjects with no established travel link to endemic areas (7-13). Reported cases are mostly characterized by mild clinical features (Table 2) (7,9,10,12,13), with no deaths and some specificities. First of all, skin lesions are inconsistently pronounced in number, size and density, being possibly confounded with chickenpox (7,13). Similarly, cervical lymphadenopathy, previously acknowledged as a nearly constant clinical sign, has been reported by less than 20% of incident cases (7,9,13), with an increased prevalence of inguinal lymph node involvement (35.3% to 48.1%) (7,9,13), anal and genital ulcers (18.5% to 57%) (9,10,13). As some cases have been initially reported in men having sex with men (9,14), with a relatively high prevalence of HIV seropositivity (9,10), reporting risky sexual behaviors and multiple sexual partners (9,10,12), and having a documented epidemiologic link with high-risk settings in Madrid and Lisbon areas, and mass gatherings in Antwerp (Belgium), and Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain) (8,9,12,14), such specificities have been initially explained through a presumptive sextually-related transmission. However, labelling the current outbreak as a sort of ""gay"" disease is not only improper and discriminating, but also scientifically inaccurate (9). First, most of reported cases remain outside a clear and well-defined chain of transmission (9,10,12). Second, the earliest symptom onset clearly ranged between April 20th and April 29th, anticipating all of the aforementioned mass gatherings (9,12). Third, 3 of recent US cases were linked to travel-associated cases from Nigeria reported in 2018 and 2019 (15). In other words, the current MPXV-WAC outbreak has been introduced in Western Hemisphere by several, distinctive episodes that have largely anticipated the initial hypotheses.

Here, we present the case of a young adult male who presented with disseminated Varicella and was simultaneously diagnosed with AIDS and COVID-19 virus with several infection-related complications.  A 25-year-old African-American male presented to the Emergency Department with vesicular, blistering rashes in multiple dermatomes including his eyelids. The screening test in the ED was positive for COVID-19. Given his high-risk sexual history, he was tested for HIV which returned positive with a CD4 count of zero. He was started on IV antivirals for disseminated varicella with zoster ophthalmicus. The patient was intubated for worsening respiratory failure and required intensive care. During the hospital course, he developed worsening encephalopathy and CSF analysis was positive for CMV and VZV. The patient has a prolonged hospital stay and exhibited evidence of infectious CNS vasculitis and HIV myelopathy. Anti-retroviral therapy was started after the acute period and the patient showed slow but definite clinical improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with AIDS with COVID-19 and disseminated VZV and with multiple complex infection-related complications.","['Daodu J', 'Basuli D', 'Parikh A']",2022,93,6,Acta Biomed,"Daodu J, et al.

36522267,Prospective study of loss of health-related quality adjusted life years in children and their families due to uncomplicated and hospitalised varicella.,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Although usually benign, varicella can lead to serious complications and sometimes long-term sequelae. Vaccines are safe and effective but not yet included in immunisation programmes in many countries. We aimed to quantify the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in children with varicella and their families, key to assessing cost-utility in countries with low mortality due to this infection.
METHODS: Children with varicella in the community and admitted to hospitals in Portugal were included over 18 months from January 2019. Children's and carers' HRQoL losses were assessed prospectively using standard multi-attribute utility instruments for measuring HRQoL (EQ-5D and CHU9D), from presentation to recovery, allowing the calculation of QALYs.
RESULTS: Among 109 families with children with varicella recruited from attendees at a pediatric emergency service (community arm), the mean HRQoL loss/child was 2.0 days (95 % CI 1.9-2.2, n = 101) (mean 5.4 QALYs/1000 children (95 % CI 5.3-6.1) and 1.3 days/primary carer (95 % CI 1.2-1.6, n = 103) (mean 3.6 QALYs /1000 carers (95 % CI 3.4-4.4). Among 114 families with children admitted to hospital because of severe varicella or a complication (hospital arm), the mean HRQoL loss/child was 9.8 days (95 % CI 9.4-10.6, n = 114) (mean 26.8 QALYs /1000 children (95 % CI 25.8-29.0) and 8.5 days/primary carer (95 % CI 7.4-9.6, n = 114) (mean 23.4 QALYs/1000 carers (95 % CI 20.3-26.2). Mean QALY losses/1000 patients were particularly high for bone and joint infections [67.5 (95 % CI 43.9-97.6)]. Estimates for children's QALYs lost using the CHU9D tool were well correlated with those obtained using EQ-5D, but substantially lower.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of varicella on HRQoL is substantial. We report the first measurements of QALYs lost in hospitalised children and in the families of children both in the community and admitted to hospital, providing important information to guide vaccination policy recommendations.","['Rodrigues F', 'Marlow R', 'Gouveia C', 'Correia P', 'Brett A', 'Silva C', 'Gameiro I', 'Rua I', 'Dias J', 'Martins M', 'Diogo R', 'Lopes T', 'Hipólito E', 'Moreira D', 'Costa Alves M', 'Prata F', 'Labrusco M', 'Gomes S', 'Fernandes A', 'Andrade A', 'Granjo Morais C', 'João Virtuoso M', 'Manuel Zarcos M', 'Teresa Raposo A', 'Boon A', 'Finn A']",2023,41,6,Vaccine,"Rodrigues F, et al.

36505626,HIV positive children living in orphanages and home care: Assessment of nutritional deficiencies and opportunistic infections.,"OBJECTIVES: With the introduction of antiretroviral treatment (ART), opportunistic infections (OIs) reduced a lot and most HIV-associated OIs are preventable and treatable with safe cost-effective interventions. But however, in order to prevent and early diagnosis, we need to have baseline estimation of OIs among HIV positive children and other factors associated, especially nutritional deficiencies.
METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was carried out in pediatric outpatient department (OPD) of a large multicentric hospital among 106 children. Data were collected by means of pretested predesigned semi-structed questionnaire prepared on consultation with experts in the subjects and clinical assessment was done in day light to detect signs of nutritional disorders. Institutional ethical clearance was taken, and strict confidentiality was maintained.
RESULTS: Majority (39.6%) of the children belong to 5-9 years. Children were equitably distributed between orphanage and family care giver. Bitot's spots, cheilosis, and gum bleeding were found to be more than twice as common in subjects living with family, as compared to those living in orphanage while aphthous ulcer, knock knee, bow leg were found to be more than twice as common in female subjects as compared males. The prevalence of Pneumonia, Mumps, Herpes zoster, Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Oral candidiasis, and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) was found to be about twice as common in subjects living with family, as compared to those living in orphanage while males had more Chicken pox, Herpes zoster, Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Oral candidiasis, and Recurrent URTI as compared to those in females.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin deficiencies and opportunistic infections were higher than the prevalence reported by the various studies done on normal children.

36503563,Assessing the use of antibiotics in pediatric patients hospitalized for varicella.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is considered a mild and self-limiting disease, but, in some cases, it may complicate and require hospitalization. Antibiotics are not the first line therapy but in some cases are prescribed either for the management of varicella-related complications or as a preventive strategy. Aim of this study is to analyze the rate and the patterns of antibiotics used in pediatric patients hospitalized for varicella as well as the relative costs in order to increase insights in antibiotic use in varicella.
METHODS: Patients less than 18 years hospitalized for varicella at the Bambino Gesù Children's IRCCS Hospital in Rome, Italy, from the 1
RESULTS: According to the inclusion criteria, we enrolled 810 patients, with a median age of 2.4 years. Out of them, 345 patients (42.6%) underwent antibiotic therapy, of which 307 for a complication (90.0%) and the other 10.0%, antibiotic for the fear of developing complications. The cost for varicella hospitalizations was EUR 2,928,749 (median cost EUR 2689). As for antibiotic therapy, it represented the 5.9% of the total cost (EUR 174,527), with a median cost of EUR 198.8. The cost in patients who underwent antibiotic therapy was significantly higher than in those who did not (p-value < 0.0001), as well as the hospitalization length (p-value < 0.0001). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were Amoxicillin-clavulanate and Ceftriaxone, which represented the 36.0% and 25.0% of all antibiotic prescription, respectively. Antibiotics may negatively affect the economic cost of hospitalization and the prescription is not always in accordance to guidelines, with potential important repercussions on the development of antimicrobial resistance. Actually, resistance to antibiotics is considered a major risk to the future health of the world population as it may lead to longer hospital stay, increased risk of mortality, health care costs and treatment failures.
CONCLUSION: Strategies to reduce economical cost, hospitalization length and antimicrobial resistance include ensuring appropriate prescription and administration of empiric antibiotics as well as reducing the circulation of preventable infectious diseases through immunization.","['Bozzola E', 'Marchesani S', 'Ficari A', 'Brusco C', 'Spina G', 'Marchili MR', 'Guolo S']",2022,48,1,Ital J Pediatr,"Bozzola E, et al.

36468883,Varicella Vaccine: a Molecular Variant That May Contribute to Attenuation.,"Varicella was troublesome when varicella vaccine (vOka) was licensed in the United States. Varicella's yearly death toll was ~100, indirect costs were massive, and varicella threatened immunocompromised children. Since licensure, varicella has almost disappeared; nevertheless, vOka attenuation has lacked a molecular explanation. Sadaoka et al. (T. Sadaoka, D. P. Depledge, L. Rajbhandari, J. Breuer, et al., mBio 13:e0186422, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01864-22), however, have now identified 6 core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which singly or in combination may contribute to VOka attenuation; moreover, they found a predominant variant allele of vOka encoding the viral glycoprotein gB that results in glutamine instead of arginine at amino acid 699. This change impairs fusion activity and the ability of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to infect human neurons from axon terminals. Molecular virological studies of vOka are reassuring in suggesting that reversion to virulence is unlikely and should also help assuage current fears about VZV vaccination and alleviate unanticipated future problems. The impressive work of Sadaoka et al. thus represents an auspicious advance in knowledge.","['Gershon AA', 'Gershon MD']",2022,13,6,mBio,Gershon AA and Gershon MD.

36457198,Global varicella vaccination programs.,"Varicella (chickenpox) is an infectious disease caused by the highly contagious varicella zoster virus with a secondary attack rate greater than 90%. From this perspective, we aimed to establish the basis for a national varicella vaccine policy by reviewing vaccination programs and policies of countries that have introduced universal varicella vaccinations. As a result of the spread of varicella, an increasing number of countries are providing 2-dose vaccinations and universally expanding their use. In practice, the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccination differ among vaccines and vaccination programs. Optimized vaccination strategies based on each country's local epidemiology and health resources are required. Accordingly, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of varicella vaccines in different settings. Given the short-term and fragmented vaccine effectiveness evaluation in Korea, it is necessary to evaluate its effectiveness at the national level and determine its schedule based on the evidence generated through these studies.","['Lee YH', 'Choe YJ', 'Lee J', 'Kim E', 'Lee JY', 'Hong K', 'Yoon Y', 'Kim YK']",2022,65,12,Clin Exp Pediatr,"Lee YH, et al.

36442623,A simple transwell-based infection system for obtaining pure populations of VZV-infected cells.,"Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpesvirus and causes chickenpox and shingles. Research into its molecular virology has been hampered by a lack of methods for generation of high-titre, cell-free infectious virus preparations. VZV propagation and infection in vitro are therefore commonly achieved by co-culture of uninfected 'target' cells with infected 'inoculum' cells. A major drawback of this approach is that it results in mixed cell populations after infection. To overcome this limitation we developed a transwell-based VZV infection system. Infected inoculum cells and uninfected target cells are spatially separated by a transwell membrane. While cell-cell contact and VZV spread can occur through membrane pores, the two cell populations do not mix. This simple protocol requires no special instrumentation or reagents. We successfully used this system for infection of a range of target cells and obtained pure populations for downstream analyses such as flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. In sum, we developed a broadly applicable approach to study the molecular and cellular biology as well as host-pathogen interactions of VZV.","['Hertzog J', 'Rehwinkel J']",2023,312,,J Virol Methods,Hertzog J and Rehwinkel J.

This study aims to assess the long-term vaccine efficacy of the two doses varicella vaccine and analysis of its influencing factors.
METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in 837,144 children born between 2011 and 2017 in Ningbo, Easten China. The logistic regression was performed to estimate varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE).
RESULTS: The overall VE of 2 doses of varicella vaccine compared without the vaccine was 90.31% (89.24-91.26%), and the overall incremental VE of 2 doses of varicella vaccine compared to the 1-dose was 64.71% (59.92-68.93%). Moreover, the varicella vaccination age of the second dose and the interval between 2 doses were both associated with VE. The VE compared to that without the vaccine in children vaccinated at <4 years old was 91.22% (95%CI: 90.16-92.17%) which was higher than in children vaccinated at ≥4 years old (VE: 86.79%; 95%CI: 84.52-88.73). And the effectiveness of the vaccine was 93.60% (95%CI: 92.19-94.75%) in children with the interval of the 2 doses ≤ 24 months significantly higher than in children with the interval of ≥36 months (VE: 85.62%, 95%CI: 82.89-87.91%).

36399767,Surveillance and risk assessment of health screening for vaccine-preventable diseases among international students in Japan: A cross-sectional study in 2020.,"We conducted a cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire in three major Japanese cities from August 03 to 24, 2020 to clarify the current situation of health checkups, including vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), among international students at Japanese universities (JUs) and Japanese language schools (JLSs). The total response rate was 36%: 69 JUs (31%) and 137 JLSs (39%). Over 90% of these institutions conducted chest X-ray screening for tuberculosis among their students, whereas only 24.6% of JUs and 15.3% of JLSs performed general blood tests for health screening. Only 14.5% and 2.2% of the JUs and JLSs, respectively, required the submission of vaccination or antibody certificates for admission. The difficulties in requesting vaccination certificates from international students are due to poor legal requirements and concerns about rising costs for schools. From 2017 to 2019, 183 international students, principally from East Asia and Southeast Asia, were infected with VPDs, particularly tuberculosis (99 cases) and varicella (71 cases). Whereas the majority of Japanese educational institutions screen international students for tuberculosis (TB) at admission, only a few institutions request proof of antibody testing relating to other VPDs or of vaccination. These findings will help formulate guidelines for checkups related to vaccination for international students required to protect the educational institutions in Japan from the spread of VPDs. In addition, providing multifaceted social support, including financial compensation for institutions and enhanced international students' health issues, would be helpful.","['Takahata H', 'Onishi K', 'Nomoto H', 'Iwamoto N', 'Hayashi K', 'Hori N', 'Kutsuna S', 'Kodama EN', 'Ohmagari N']",2022,18,6,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Takahata H, et al.

Soldiers are one of the main professional groups to be immunized on a regular basis. The military actively participates in research on new vaccine preparations. This paper presents data from 2018-2021 on vaccination among Polish soldiers. The material obtained from the Central Register of Vaccination for Professional Soldiers was analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. The number of injections performed in a given period depends on the location of the ongoing missions and the vaccination schedule specific to a given Polish Military Contingent. In Poland, soldiers undergo preventive vaccinations in accordance with the scheme developed by the Armed Forces Operational Command, taking into account the specific nature of the service, epidemiological risks and the calendar of current preventive vaccinations. Soldiers serving abroad are immunized against typhoid, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, measles, tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, polio, diphtheria, meningococcal disease, chickenpox, cholera and yellow fever.

36357854,Medical screening tests and vaccination among hospital-based physicians in Israel.,"BACKGROUND: Very few studies have evaluated physician participation in screening tests and vaccinations. The aim was to evaluate attitudes and actual practice of screening tests and vaccinations among hospital-based physicians and to identify factors that predict actual performance.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 220 physicians in various specializations. The study was conducted between January 1, 2017 and December 10, 2017. The statistical analysis was performed during October, 2020 and completed in October 25, 2020.
RESULTS: The vast majority of physicians (94%) believed in the importance of screening tests for physicians, but less than half actually underwent the tests themselves. A high percentage of physicians measured their BMI (84.5%) and had a serum lipid profile test (67.7%) and complete blood counts (75%) over the previous five years, but less than a third of female physicians over 50 years of age had a mammogram and only 8% of the physicians over 50 had a fecal occult blood test. A high percentage of physicians were vaccinated for Hepatitis A and B, chickenpox and measles (66-96% for the various vaccinations), but only 41% had an influenza vaccination in the previous year. In a multivariate logistic regression model, physicians who believed that hospital physicians bore a responsibility for recommending screening tests to their patients were more likely to have their BMI and their blood pressure checked (OR = 2.234, P = 0.007). They were more likely to undergo laboratory testing (OR = 4.082, P < 0.0001) and tended to get vaccinated more (OR = 1.907, P = 0.051).
CONCLUSION: The rate of screening tests and vaccinations among hospital-based physicians is sub-optimal and very low for fecal occult blood testing and mammograms. Structured programs are required to implement screening tests and vaccinations among physicians.","['Eltalakat S', 'Gariba BA', 'Peleg R', 'Kaplan D', 'Treister-Goltzman Y']",2022,22,1,BMC Health Serv Res,"Eltalakat S, et al.

36342391,An Unusual Case of Arm Pain in a Young Soccer Player: Herpes Zoster in the Pediatric Athlete.,"Herpes zoster (HZ), shingles, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). HZ develops as a reactivation of latent VZV and is characterized by a painful, vesicular rash typically manifesting in a dermatomal distribution on the arms, trunk or face. HZ occurs in individuals who had primary VZV disease (chickenpox) as a child or in those who have received live, attenuated VZV vaccine. HZ is common in the elderly and the immunocompromised, with age being the single greatest risk factor. The incidence of HZ in children is 74/100,000 person years for the unvaccinated and 38/100,000 person years for the vaccinated. We discuss the case of a 12-year-old soccer player with HZ who presented with right arm pain after a putative traumatic event. Diagnosis was made after two emergency department visits where the condition was not identified. HZ should be considered in the clinician's differential even in immunocompetent, vaccinated children.","['MacDonald J', 'Mosser-Goldfarb J', 'Souverbielle CT', 'Cuff S']",2022,21,11,Curr Sports Med Rep,"MacDonald J, et al.

36323399,Antibody Response against Vaccine Antigens in Children after TCRαβ-Depleted Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation: Is It Similar to That in Recipients with Fully Matched Donors?,"Recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with HLA-mismatched donors are more immune suppressed than those with fully matched donors. The immunologic response to vaccines also may differ in HLA-mismatched haploidentical HSCT recipients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antibody response to vaccines in pediatric TCRαβ-depleted haploidentical HSCT recipients. This longitudinal study included a study group of 21 children who underwent haploidentical HSCT without CD19 depletion and with TCRαβ depletion and a control group of 38 children who underwent fully matched donor HSCT. Antibody levels were quantified by serologic tests before vaccination and after each dose against tetanus, diphtheria, pneumococcus, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella. The median recipient age was significantly lower (P = .037) and the median donor age was significantly higher (P = .000) in the haploidentical group compared with the fully matched group. At the months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 post-transplantation, the median CD4, CD8, and CD19 cell counts and lymphocyte counts were similar in the haploidentical and fully matched groups. The median natural killer cell count was higher in the haploidentical group at the months 1, 3, and 6 post-transplantation (P = .001, .006, and .004, respectively). The median time to first vaccination was similar in the 2 groups (12.5 [range, 11 to 14] months for the haploidentical group and 11 [range, 9 to 13] months for the fully matched group; P = .441). Seroprotection rates were 100% in both groups after the second and third doses of diphtheria vaccine, the third dose of tetanus vaccine, the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine, the second and third doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13), and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PSPV23), although lower after the initial doses and before vaccination. Seroprotection for hepatitis A, rubella, and varicella was >90% in the fully matched group and 100% for the haploidentical group after the second doses. Measles and mumps seroprotection rates were >80% in the haploidentical group and approximately 70% for the fully matched group after the second dose. Antibody response and seroprotection rates against vaccine antigens were similar in the haploidentical group and the fully matched when revaccination was started at 12 months post-transplantation. These findings support the idea that TCRαβ-depleted haploidentical HSCT recipients can be revaccinated according to the same vaccination schedule as fully matched HSCT recipients. Revaccination earlier after transplantation and vaccine responses for recipients of different types of HSCT should be evaluated in future studies.","['Kondolot M', 'Yilmaz E', 'Erdog Sahin N', 'Ozcan A', 'Kaynar L', 'Unal E', 'Karakukcu M']",2023,29,2,Transplant Cell Ther,"Kondolot M, et al.

36315970,The health and economic impact of switching vaccines in universal varicella vaccination programs using a dynamic transmission model: An Israel case study.,"Currently available health economic models for varicella infection are designed to inform the cost-effectiveness of universal varicella vaccination (UVV) compared with no vaccination. However, in countries with an existing UVV program, these models cannot be used to evaluate whether to continue with the current varicella vaccine or to switch to an alternative vaccine. We developed a dynamic transmission model that incorporates the historical vaccination program to project the health and economic impact of changing vaccination strategies. We applied the model to Israel, which initiated UVV in 2008 with a quadrivalent vaccine, MMRV-GSK, and switched to MMRV-MSD in 2016. The model was calibrated to pre-vaccination incidence data before projecting the impact of the historical and future alternative vaccination strategies on the clinical burden of varicella. Total costs and QALYs lost due to varicella infections were projected to compare continuing with MMRV-MSD versus switching to MMRV-GSK in 2022. Over a 50-year time horizon, continuing with MMRV-MSD reduced varicella incidence further by 64%, reaching 35 cases per 100,000 population by 2072, versus a 136% increase in incidence with MMRV-GSK. Continuing with MMRV-MSD reduced cumulative hospitalization and outpatient cases by 48% and 58% (vs. increase of 137% and 91% with MMRV-GSK), respectively. Continuing with MMRV-MSD resulted in 139 fewer QALYs lost with total cost savings of 3% compared with switching to MMRV-GSK, from the societal perspective. In Israel, maintaining the UVV strategy with MMRV-MSD versus switching to MMRV-GSK is projected to further reduce the burden of varicella and cost less from the societal perspective.","['Kujawski SA', 'Burgess C', 'Agi O', 'Attias-Geva Z', 'Pillsbury M', 'Greenberg D', 'Bencina G', 'Pawaskar M']",2022,18,6,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Kujawski SA, et al.

36303401,Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU) Annual Surveillance Report 2021.,"The Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU) has been conducting surveillance of rare communicable and non-communicable conditions in children since its inception in 1993. In this report, the results are described of surveillance of ten communicable diseases (and complications) for 2021, including the numbers of cases and incidence estimates; demographics; clinical features; and management and short-term outcomes. The included diseases are: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP); congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV); neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection; paediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; perinatal exposure to HIV; severe complications from influenza; juvenile-onset respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP); congenital rubella syndrome; congenital varicella syndrome; and neonatal varicella infection. In 2021, cases of JoRRP were reported to the APSU for the first time since 2017, indicating potential gaps in HPV vaccination. AFP surveillance by APSU again contributed to Australia achieving a minimum target incidence of one AFP case per 100,000 children aged < 15 years. There were no cases of children with severe complications of influenza. No cases of varicella or congenital rubella were reported; however, at-risk populations, especially young migrant and refugee women from countries without universal vaccination programs, need to be screened and prioritised for vaccination prior to pregnancy. Cases of perinatal exposure to HIV continue to increase; however, the rate of mother-to-child-transmission remains at low levels due to the use of effective intervention strategies. Case numbers of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV remain steady in the absence of vaccines, prompting the need for greater awareness and education, with recent calls for target screening of at-risk infants for congenital CMV.","['Teutsch SM', 'Nunez CA', 'Morris A', 'Eslick GD', 'Berkhout A', 'Novakovic D', 'Brotherton JM', 'McGregor S', 'Khawar L', 'Khandaker G', 'Booy R', 'Jones CA', 'Rawlinson W', 'Thorley BR', 'Elliott EJ']",2022,46,,Commun Dis Intell (2018),"Teutsch SM, et al.

36301976,Prior antibiotics and risk of subsequent Herpes zoster: A population-based case control study.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of antibiotics on the human microbiome is now well established, but their indirect effect on the related immune response is less clear. The possible association of Herpes zoster, which involves a reactivation of a previous varicella zoster virus infection, with prior antibiotic exposure might indicate a potential link with the immune response.
METHODS: A case-control study was carried out using a clinical database, the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink. A total of 163,754 patients with varicella zoster virus infection and 331,559 age/sex matched controls were identified and their antibiotic exposure over the previous 10 years, and longer when data permitted, was identified. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify the association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent infection in terms of volume and timing.
RESULTS: The study found an association of antibiotic prescription and subsequent risk of varicella zoster virus infection (adjusted odds ratio of 1.50; 95%CIs: 1.42-1.58). The strongest association was with a first antibiotic over 10 years ago (aOR: 1.92; 95%CIs: 1.88-1.96) which was particularly pronounced in the younger age group of 18 to 50 (aOR 2.77; 95%CIs: 1.95-3.92).
CONCLUSIONS: By finding an association between prior antibiotics and Herpes zoster this study has shown that antibiotics may be involved in the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus. That effect, moreover, may be relatively long term. This indirect effect of antibiotics on viruses, possibly mediated through their effect on the microbiome and immune system, merits further study.","['Armstrong D', 'Dregan A', 'Ashworth M', 'White P']",2022,17,10,PLoS One,"Armstrong D, et al.

36301037,"Association of asthma and herpes zoster, the role of vaccination: A literature review.","Herpes Zoster (HZ) is the reactivation of a previous infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) which shares the same mode of transmission as HZ. It presents with painful erythematous vesicles in a dermatome which is characterized by a burning sensation before and after the rash. Any conditions with suppressed cellular immunity example diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, chronic steroid uses, malignancy, etc. causes reactivation of the virus. Impaired immune responses in asthma patients either in any age group may increase their susceptibility to HZ infection owing to skewed Th1/Th2 immunity, resulting in predominant Th2 conditions and an unwarranted Th2 cell response against respiratory allergens. Similarly, many studies have delineated the association of asthma with HZ. However, the relation between steroid use in asthma and HZ is uncertain, its immunosuppressive effect might be responsible for increased susceptibility to the infection. As HZ increases the economic burden and morbidity, its prevention should use vaccines. There are two types of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine available against HSV one of which is given as a single dose vaccine called Zostavax, for people 50-59 years but its efficacy falls after 3rd dose and on the subsequent 4th dose and is also contraindicated in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, pregnancy and people taking immunosuppressive drugs. Shingrix is preferred by FDA which is a two doses vaccine that is given 6 months apart for people above 50 years and to immunocompromised people. Hence, proper counseling and education about the risks of herpes should be informed to the patients with timely utilization of the vaccine.","['Shrestha AB', 'Umar TP', 'Mohammed YA', 'Aryal M', 'Shrestha S', 'Sapkota UH', 'Adhikari L', 'Shrestha S']",2022,10,11,Immun Inflamm Dis,"Shrestha AB, et al.

It is important to identify and immunize susceptible healthcare workers to prevent and control hospital infections. Our aim was to estimate the susceptibility level of healthcare workers at a Teaching Hospital in Rome concerning these diseases and the factors associated to the susceptibility. Methods: a cross sectional study was carried out at the Department of Occupational Medicine of the Umberto I General Hospital of Rome. Participants were recruited during routine occupational health surveillance. As far as inclusion criteria, the following professionals were considered: doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians and other health professionals. Concerning the exclusion criteria, patients with HIV, cancer and diseases of the immune system, and acute illness or fever more than 38.5 °C, were not included in the study. A blood sample was tested for the presence of antibodies against measles, rubella and chicken pox. Results: 1106 healthcare professionals were involved in the study (41.8% nurses, 30.4% doctors, 12.3% laboratory technicians, 15.1% other health professionals): 25 (2.3%), 73 (6.6%) and 35 (3.2%) of these were susceptible to measles, rubella and chicken pox, respectively. The only variable associated with susceptibility of measles was age (p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was evidence of an association between various susceptibilities, particularly between measles and chickenpox (OR: 4.38). Conclusion: this study showed that even if the majority of our healthcare professionals are immunized for MRV, it is necessary not to underestimate the seronegativity of non-immune ones.

36265856,The Impact of Universal Varicella Vaccination on Herpes Zoster Incidence in the United States: Comparison of Birth Cohorts Preceding and Following Varicella Vaccination Program Launch.,"When the US varicella vaccination program was introduced in 1995, its impacts on the epidemiology of herpes zoster (HZ) were not precisely known. We used a large claims database to examine HZ incidence in the US during 1998-2019 among persons aged ≥30 years (the prevaccine cohort, born before 1990), and aged 1-29 years (includes the postvaccine cohort, born since 1990). We defined incident HZ as the first instance of an outpatient or emergency department (ED) claim with an HZ diagnostic code. Additionally, we examined the proportion of HZ visits among all ED visits as a complementary method to assess for healthcare-seeking artifacts in the findings. In persons aged ≥30 years (prevaccine cohort), we observed age-specific increases in HZ incidence during the earlier study years, with decelerations in later years, starting in 2007 with oldest age groups. Similar patterns were seen when we examined HZ visits as a proportion of all ED visits. For persons aged 1-29 years, age-specific HZ incidence increased early in the study period for the oldest age groups who were born prevaccine, but later declined in a stepwise pattern once each age group was comprised of persons born in the postvaccine period. Our results, corroborated with previously published studies, do not support prior modeling predictions that the varicella vaccination program would increase HZ incidence among adult cohorts who previously experienced varicella. Our findings also suggest that continued declines in age-specific HZ incidence as varicella-vaccinated cohorts age are likely.","['Leung J', 'Dooling K', 'Marin M', 'Anderson TC', 'Harpaz R']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,"Leung J, et al.

METHODS: Health care providers and consumers sent voluntary reports about women who received VARIVAX 3 months before or during pregnancy. Follow-up occurred to evaluate pregnancy outcomes for birth defects. Outcomes from prospectively reported pregnancy exposures (ie, reports received before the outcome of the pregnancy was known) among varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-seronegative women were used to calculate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: From 17 March 1995 through 16 October 2013, 1601 women were enrolled-966 prospectively-among whom there were 819 live births. Among 164 infants born to women who were VZV seronegative at the time of vaccination, no cases of congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) were identified (rate, 0 per 100, 95% CI, 0.0-2.2) and the birth prevalence of major birth defects was 4.3 per 100 liveborn infants (95% CI 1.7-8.6) with no pattern suggestive of CVS. No defects consistent with CVS were identified in any registry reports.
CONCLUSIONS: Data collected through the VARIVAX pregnancy registry do not support a relationship between the occurrence of CVS or major birth defects and varicella vaccine exposure during pregnancy, although the small numbers of exposures cannot rule out a low risk. VARIVAX remains contraindicated during pregnancy.","['Willis ED', 'Marko AM', 'Rasmussen SA', 'McGee M', 'Broder KR', 'Marin M']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,"Willis ED, et al.

During the 1-dose varicella vaccination program (1995‒2006), the number of varicella outbreaks declined by 80% (2003-2006 vs 1995-1998) in 1 active surveillance area where vaccination coverage reached 90.5% in 2006. During the 2-dose program, in 7 states with consistent reporting to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of outbreaks declined by 82% (2016-2019 vs 2005-2006). Over the entire program (1995-2019), outbreak size and duration declined from a median of 15 cases/outbreak and 45 days duration to 7 cases and 30 days duration. The proportion of outbreaks with <10 cases increased from 28% to 73%. During 2016‒2019, most (79%) outbreak cases occurred among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated persons eligible for second-dose vaccination, highlighting the potential for further varicella control.","['Leung J', 'Lopez AS', 'Marin M']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,"Leung J, et al.

36265850,Diagnostic and Immunologic Testing for Varicella in the Era of High-Impact Varicella Vaccination: An Evolving Problem.,"The clinical presentation of varicella in unvaccinated persons, with skin vesicles and scabs, has facilitated the use of rapid diagnostic methods for confirming disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are the diagnostic method of choice. The sharp decline in unmodified cases of varicella due to the US varicella vaccination program has led to fewer healthcare providers being familiar with varicella presentation and an increased reliance on laboratory diagnosis to confirm suspected cases. The mild, atypical presentation of the disease in vaccinated persons (fewer skin lesions, mostly maculopapular) has made it more challenging for providers to recognize and also to collect samples to detect the virus. Nonetheless, PCR is highly sensitive and specific in confirming modified disease if adequate samples are provided. While a positive PCR result is confirmatory, interpreting a negative result can prove to be more challenging in determining whether suspected varicella is falsely negative or attributable to other causes. Enhanced education of healthcare providers is critical for adequate specimen collection from modified varicella cases. In addition, more sensitive commercial serologic assays are needed in the United States for varicella immunity testing in the vaccine era.","['Dollard S', 'Chen MH', 'Lindstrom S', 'Marin M', 'Rota PA']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,"Dollard S, et al.

However, patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) continue to introduce varicella zoster virus (VZV) into healthcare settings. Herpes zoster (HZ) is less contagious than varicella, but it can also result in exposures. Unrecognized varicella and HZ may lead to extensive contact investigations, control efforts, and HCP furloughs that result in significant disruption of healthcare activities as well as substantial costs. Robust occupational health and infection prevention programs that ensure healthcare personnel immunity and prompt recognition and isolation of patients with varicella or HZ will lower the risk of VZV transmission and reduce or eliminate the need to furlough exposed HCP and associated costs.","['Drees M', 'Weber DJ']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,Drees M and Weber DJ.

36265848,Celebrating 25 Years of Varicella Vaccination Coverage for Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Success Story.,"Tracking vaccination coverage is a critical component of monitoring a vaccine program. Three different surveillance systems were used to examine trends in varicella vaccination coverage during the United States vaccination program: National Immunization Survey-Child, National Immunization Survey-Teen, and immunization information systems (IISs). The relationship of these trends to school requirements and disease decline was also examined. Among children aged 19-35 months, ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine increased from 16.0% in 1996 to 89.2% by the end of the 1-dose program in 2006, stabilizing around at least 90.0% thereafter. The uptake of the second dose was rapid after the 2007 recommendation. Two-dose coverage among children aged 7 years at 6 high-performing IIS sites increased from 2.6%-5.5% in 2006 to 86.0%-100.0% in 2020. Among adolescents aged 13-17 years, ≥2-dose coverage increased from 4.1% in 2006 to 91.9% in 2020. The proportion of adolescents with history of varicella disease declined from 69.9% in 2006 to 8.4% in 2020. In 2006, 92% of states and the District of Columbia (DC) had 1-dose daycare or school entry requirements; 88% of states and DC had 2-dose school entry requirements in the 2020-2021 school year. The successes in attaining and maintaining high vaccine coverage were paramount in the dramatic reduction of the varicella burden in the United States over the 25 years of the vaccination program, but opportunities remain to further increase coverage and decrease varicella morbidity and mortality.","['Elam-Evans LD', 'Valier MR', 'Fredua B', 'Zell E', 'Murthy BP', 'Sterrett N', 'Harris LQ', 'Leung J', 'Singleton JA', 'Marin M']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,"Elam-Evans LD, et al.

METHODS: Analysis was conducted using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or published annual population-based varicella incidence, and varicella-associated hospitalization, outpatient visit, and mortality rates in the US population aged 0-49 years during 1996-2020 (range, 199.5-214.2 million persons) compared to before vaccination (1990-1994). Disease costs were estimated using the societal perspective. Vaccination program costs included costs of vaccine, administration, postvaccination adverse events, and travel and work time lost to obtain vaccination. All costs were adjusted to 2020 US dollars using a 3% annual discount rate. The main outcome measures were the number of varicella-associated cases, hospitalizations, hospitalization days, and premature deaths prevented; life-years saved; and net societal savings from the US varicella vaccination program.
RESULTS: Among US persons aged 0-49 years, during 1996-2020, it is estimated that more than 91 million varicella cases, 238 000 hospitalizations, 1.1 million hospitalization days, and almost 2000 deaths were prevented and 118 000 life-years were saved by the varicella vaccination program, at net societal savings of $23.4 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella vaccination has resulted in substantial disease prevention and societal savings for the US over 25 years of program implementation.","['Zhou F', 'Leung J', 'Marin M', 'Dooling KL', 'Anderson TC', 'Ortega-Sanchez IR']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,"Zhou F, et al.

36265846,"Safety Surveillance of Varicella Vaccines in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, United States, 2006-2020.","BACKGROUND: . The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is the United States national passive vaccine safety surveillance system. We updated the data on the safety of single-antigen varicella vaccine (VAR) and assessed the safety of combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV) licensed in the United States using VAERS data.
METHODS: US VAERS reports received after administration of VAR and MMRV during 2006-2020 were identified. Reports were analyzed by vaccine type, age, seriousness, most common adverse events (AEs), and concomitant vaccines. We reviewed medical records of selected reports of AEs of special interest and conducted empirical Bayesian data mining to identify disproportionally reported AEs.
RESULTS: During 2006-2020, approximately 132.8 million VAR doses were distributed; 40 684 reports were received in VAERS (30.6/100 000 doses distributed), with 4.1% classified as serious (1.3/100 000 doses distributed). Approximately 35.5 million MMRV doses were distributed; 13 325 reports were received (37.6/100 000 doses distributed) with 3.3% classified as serious (1.3/100 000 doses distributed). The most common adverse health events after both VAR and MMRV were injection site reactions (31% and 27%), rash (28% and 20%), and fever (12% and 14%), respectively. Vaccination errors accounted for 23% of reports after VAR administration and 41% after MMRV administration, but ≥95% of them did not describe an adverse health event. AEs associated with evidence of vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus (vVZV) infection included meningitis, encephalitis, herpes zoster, and 6 deaths (all in immunocompromised persons with contraindications for vaccination). No new or unexpected AE was disproportionally reported.
CONCLUSIONS: No new or unexpected safety findings were detected for VAR and MMRV given as recommended, reinforcing the favorable safety profiles of these vaccines. Providers should obtain specimens for viral testing and strain-typing for serious AEs if they consider vVZV as the possible causative agent.","['Moro PL', 'Leung J', 'Marquez P', 'Kim Y', 'Wei S', 'Su JR', 'Marin M']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,"Moro PL, et al.

One dose of varicella vaccine provided moderate protection (82%-85%) against varicella of any severity and high protection (100%) against severe varicella, with some waning of protection over time. The 1-dose program (1995-2006) had a substantial impact on the incidence both of varicella and of severe outcomes (71%-90% decrease) although it did not prevent low-level community transmission and some outbreaks continued to occur in highly vaccinated populations. Two doses of varicella vaccine improved the vaccine's effectiveness by at least 10% against varicella of any severity, with further declines in the incidence both of varicella and of severe outcomes as well as in both number and size of outbreaks. There is no evidence for waning of the effectiveness of 2 doses of the vaccine.","['Shapiro ED', 'Marin M']",2022,226,Suppl 4,J Infect Dis,Shapiro ED and Marin M.

36243938,Neonatal Onset of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Due to Prenatal Varicella-Zoster Infection in a Neonate with Griscelli Syndrome Type 2.,"Type 2 Griscelli syndrome (Type2 GS) is a primary inborn error of the immune system, classified in the immune dysregulation group.1,2 There are three different types of the disease, with different genetic causes responsible for the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Although hypopigmentation is common in all variants, neurological involvement or immunodeficiency with varying severity is seen in different types. Molecular motor protein myosin 5 an (MYo5A) [Type1GS], guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) binding protein (RAB27A) [Type2GS], and mutation in human melanophilin (MLPH) [Type 3GS] which is limited to hypopigmentation are reported as the known genetic defects in GS.3 Severe, ineffective, and uncontrolled inflammatory reactions are referred to as the pathogenesis of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is a life-threatening condition that can be defined as either primary or secondary. Secondary causes happen in the context of autoimmunity, malignancy, spontaneous, or infections.4 Prenatal infections play an important role in causing long-term complications in the fetus. Some of them include toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and other organisms including syphilis, parvovirus, and Varicella zoster, known as TORCH syndrome (5).TORCH has been well described for a long time but there are limited reports of developing HLH in the context of prenatal infections. We described a type 2GS syndrome with neonatal-onset HLH triggered by a prenatal infection.","['Nodehi H', 'Faranoush M', 'Arshi S', 'Nabavi M', 'Bemanian MH', 'Shokri S', 'Saghafi MR', 'Fallah MS', 'Fallahpour M']",2022,21,4,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Nodehi H, et al.

36243667,Seroprevalence of varicella-zoster virus antibody and immunogenicity of live attenuated varicella vaccine in healthcare workers in Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) without evidence of immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are recommended to undergo varicella vaccination. Immunogenicity of live attenuated varicella vaccine has rarely been investigated among HCWs in Taiwan.
METHODS: Anti-VZV immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer was checked for all HCWs at Changhua Christian Hospital from 2011 to 2017. One-dose and two-dose (separated by 4-8 weeks) vaccines were administered to HCWs with equivocal and negative anti-varicella IgG results, respectively. Follow-up anti-VZV IgG was determined at least 4 weeks after completion of vaccination. Factors associated with seroconversion to varicella vaccination were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 2406 included HCWs, the anti-VZV IgG serostatus was tested positive, equivocal and negative in 1924 (79.9%), 117 (4.9%) and 365 (15.2%), respectively. The seroprevalence had decreased from 88.0% (235/267) in 2011 to 72.2% (270/374) in 2017 (p for trend <0.05). A total of 67.8% (327/482) HCWs completed scheduled vaccination and serological follow-up. The seroconversion rates for HCWs with baseline equivocal and negative anti-VZV IgG results were 100% (80/80) and 79.4% (196/247) after one- and two-dose vaccination, respectively. In multivariate analysis, obesity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.308; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.94, p = 0.039) was the only factor statistically significantly associated with seroconversion to vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Decreasing trends of seroprevalence of VZV were observed among HCWs from 2011 to 2017. HCWs who were obese were less likely to respond to varicella vaccination.","['Chong CH', 'Liu CE', 'Leong YY', 'Liao SY', 'Lai HW', 'Lee YL']",2023,56,2,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Chong CH, et al.

36228673,Monkeypox: the resurgence of forgotten things.,"Monkeypox, a rare zoonotic disease, is primarily prevalent in Central and Western Africa. However, monkeypox is emerging as a worldwide concern due to the 2022 monkeypox outbreak, which is the first instance of widespread community transmission outside Africa. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus and presents as a vesicular-pustular disease that may be preceded by fever, malaise, and other constitutional symptoms. If present, lymphadenopathy may distinguish it from chickenpox or smallpox. However, contrary to previous manifestations, most monkeypox patients presented with atypical features during the 2022 outbreak. Monkeypox is usually a self-limiting disease with symptoms lasting between 2 weeks and 4 weeks and is mainly transmitted when a person comes into contact with an infected animal, person, or fomites contaminated with the virus. Very few treatment options are available for this disease. Tecovirimat has been licensed in some countries for the treatment of smallpox and monkeypox infections. Two other medications, cidofovir and brincidofovir, have been found to be effective against poxviruses in in vitro and animal studies, but data on human cases of monkeypox are limited. Although Imvamune (JYNNEOS), a vaccine against monkeypox, is authorized in the United States, there are currently no established routine vaccination programs. Current preventive strategies focus on the detection of probable cases and containment of the outbreak through the implementation of selected ring vaccination programs. Fundamental principles to prevent the spread of monkeypox, including maintaining personal hygiene and avoiding close contact with symptomatic patients, are of paramount importance.","['Kim SB', 'Jung J', 'Peck KR']",2022,44,,Epidemiol Health,"Kim SB, et al.

36222610,Reduced antiviral seropositivity among patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with immunosuppressive agents.,"BACKGROUND: Although live-attenuated vaccines are contraindicated under immunosuppression, the immune status of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been fully assessed prior to immunosuppressive therapy.
AIMS: To investigate antiviral serostatus against viruses requiring live vaccines for prevention in IBD patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.
METHODS: This multicenter study included IBD patients who were aged <40 years and were treated with thiopurine monotherapy, molecular-targeted monotherapy, or combination therapy. Gender- and age-matched healthy subjects (HS) living in the same areas were included as control group. Antibody titers against measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
RESULTS: A total of 437 IBD patients (163 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 274 Crohn's disease [CD]) and 225 HS were included in the final analysis. Compared with HS, IBD patients had lower seropositivity rates for measles (IBD vs. HS = 83.91% vs. 85.33%), rubella (77.55% vs. 84.89%), mumps (37.50% vs. 37.78%), and varicella (91.26% vs. 96.44%). Gender- and age-adjusted seropositivity rates were lower in UC patients than in both CD patients and HS for measles (UC, CD, and HS = 81.60%, 85.29%, and 85.33%), rubella (76.40%, 78.23%, and 84.89%), mumps (27.16%, 43.70%, and 37.78%), and varicella (90.80%, 91.54%, and 96.44%); the difference was significant for all viruses except measles. Divided by the degree of immunosuppression, there were no significant differences in seropositivity rates among IBD patients.

36212822,Construction of chicken infectious anemia virus infectious clone and study on its pathogenicity.,"Chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) can be transmitted through contaminated live poultry vaccine. However, the pathogenicity of contaminated CIAV strains is rarely reported. Previously, the chickens showed the typical symptoms of anemia after using the attenuated live fowl pox virus (FPV) vaccine. Therefore, exogenous CIAV contamination was suspected. We detected anti-CIAV antibodies in SPF chicks vaccinated with the FPV vaccine. CIAV contamination was confirmed in the FPV vaccine, and the CIAV strain was named JS2020-FPV. This study aims to rescue JS2020-FPV by reverse genetic assays and investigate its pathogenicity. Firstly, double-copies infectious clone of JS2020-FPV was constructed.

This review summarizes our current knowledge of such VZV ocular infection phenotype, incorporating initial descriptions from 1988. We describe the pathogenesis and VZV's manifestations in the retina using fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Laboratory investigations, diagnostic procedures, prognoses, and treatment options are also being reviewed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Ten case reports where VZV retinal vasculopathy was the primary feature observed after varicella or zoster rash are described. The retinal arteriole, cilioretinal artery, branches of retinal artery, central retinal artery and ophthalmic artery were found to be areas of more rarely affected, neither in the form of vasculitis nor retinitis. Diagnosis is typically made from positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV from extracted intraocular fluid or positive serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anti-VZV immunoglobulin G antibody in the context of compatible ocular findings. In addition, retinal vasculopathy occurring in the setting of confirmed varicella or zoster rashes could be considered potentially pathognomonic. Pathological concepts, including direct VZV infection of affected tissue, persistent inflammation, and/or virus-induced hypercoagulability are also discussed.
SUMMARY: VZV may produce a wide spectrum of ocular manifestations with isolated VZV retinal vasculopathy being a rarer presentation. A prompt diagnosis followed by an early treatment of systemic acyclovir with or without corticosteroids is the mainstay of treatment.","['Sutra P', 'Pokawattana I']",2022,33,6,Curr Opin Ophthalmol,Sutra P and Pokawattana I.

36133748,A case report of monkeypox as a result of conflict in the context of a measles campaign.,"INTRODUCTION: Northwest and Southwest Cameroon suffer with ongoing conflict, associated with internal displacement of communities into bushland, violence and destruction of the health system.
CASE PRESENTATION: During a measles immunisation and surveillance campaign, following a measles outbreak, a 14-year-old boy was identified as having fever and a rash. This developed following close contact with a giant forest rat. He was diagnosed with monkeypox and this was confirmed by PCR. He was treated with oral cloxacillin and topical tetracycline for superadded bacterial skin and eye infections, and isolation policies were put in place. His rash improved over 7 days, when it scabbed over and his fever settled.
DISCUSSION: Recent displacement into a bush settlement away from agricultural opportunities increased his family's reliance on bush meat. Displacement away from established surveillance systems increased the risk of undetected transmission. This is the second confirmed case of Monkeypox in Cameroon in the last year, and the first in the Southwest region.
CONCLUSION: Conflict led to the breakdown of surveillance systems, a lack of health personnel, destruction of health facilities and displacement of communities, which raised the risk of monkeypox outbreaks within Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Surveillance for monkeypox is challenging due to clinical similarity to chickenpox. There is a risk of emergence in new regions with suitable hosts. The factors underlying the establishment of monkeypox infections in new regions are multifactorial and require a strong public health response for prevention and control. A OneHealth approach to emerging infectious diseases is essential.","['Jarman EL', 'Alain M', 'Conroy N', 'Omam LA']",2022,4,,Public Health Pract (Oxf),"Jarman EL, et al.

36128930,Varicella zoster virus and cardiovascular diseases.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a Herpesviridae family double-stranded DNA virus that only affects humans. The first clinical manifestation appears to be varicella, typical of childhood. VZV, on the other hand, becomes latent in ganglion neurons throughout the neuroaxis after primary infection. The VZV reactivates and travels along peripheral nerve fibers in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, resulting in Zoster. It can, however, spread centrally and infect cerebral and extracranial arteries, resulting in vasculopathy, which can lead to transient ischemic attacks, strokes, aneurysms, cavernous sinus thrombosis, giant cell arteritis, and granulomatous aortitis. Although the mechanisms of virus-induced pathological vascular remodeling are not fully understood, recent research indicates that inflammation and dysregulation of ligand-1 programmed death play a significant role. Few studies, on the other hand, have looked into the role of VZV in cardiovascular disease. As a result, the purpose of this review is to examine the relationship between VZV and cardiovascular disease, the efficacy of the vaccine as a protective mechanism, and the target population of heart disease patients who could benefit from vaccination.","['Cersosimo A', 'Riccardi M', 'Amore L', 'Cimino G', 'Arabia G', 'Metra M', 'Vizzardi E']",2022,93,2,Monaldi Arch Chest Dis,"Cersosimo A, et al.

36066801,"Effects of meteorological factors on the incidence of varicella in Lu'an, Eastern China, 2015-2020.","Varicella (chickenpox) is a serious public health problem in China, with the most reported cases among childhood vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, and its reported incidence has increased over 20-fold since 2005. Few previous studies have explored the association of multiple meteorological factors with varicella and considered the potential confounding effects of air pollutants. It is the first study to investigate and analyze the effects of multiple meteorological factors on varicella incidence, controlling for the confounding effects of various air pollutants. Daily meteorological and air pollution data and varicella cases were collected from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, in Lu'an, Eastern China. A combination of the quasi-Poisson generalized additive model (GAM) and distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was used to evaluate the meteorological factor-lag-varicella relationship, and the risk of varicella in extreme meteorological conditions. The maximum single-day lag effects of varicella were 1.288 (95%CI, 1.201-1.381, lag 16 day), 1.475 (95%CI, 1.152-1.889, lag 0 day), 1.307 (95%CI, 1.196-1.427, lag 16 day), 1.271 (95%CI, 0.981-1.647, lag 4 day), and 1.266 (95%CI, 1.162-1.378, lag 21 day), when mean temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR), mean air pressure, wind speed, and sunshine hours were -5.8°C, 13.5°C, 1035.5 hPa, 6 m/s, and 0 h, respectively. At the maximum lag period, the overall effects of mean temperature and pressure on varicella showed W-shaped curves, peaked at 17.5°C (RR=2.085, 95%CI: 1.480-2.937) and 1035.5 hPa (RR=5.481, 95%CI: 1.813-16.577), while DTR showed an M-shaped curve and peaked at 4.4°C (RR=6.131, 95%CI: 1.120-33.570). Sunshine hours were positively correlated with varicella cases at the lag of 0-8 days and 0-9 days when sunshine duration exceeded 10 h. Furthermore, the lag effects of extreme meteorological factors on varicella cases were statistically significant, except for the extremely high wind speed. We found that mean temperature, mean air pressure, DTR, and sunshine hours had significant nonlinear effects on varicella incidence, which may be important predictors of varicella early warning.","['Zhang T', 'Qin W', 'Nie T', 'Zhang D', 'Wu X']",2023,30,4,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Zhang T, et al.

36045469,Stochastic modelling of scalar time series of varicella incidence for a period of 92 years (1928-2019).,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella is an acute, highly contagious disease, characterised by generalised vesicular exanthema caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) which usually affects children aged 2 to 8 years.
AIM: To analyse the changes of varicella incidence in Bulgaria over the period of 1928-2019.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The time series analysis is based on the official data for varicella incidence (per 100,000) in Bulgaria for ninety-two years (1928-2019), obtained from three major sources. We utilized the method to construct a time series model of overall incidence (1928-2019) using time series modeller in SPSS v. 25. We followed all three steps of the standard ARIMA methodology to establish the model - identification, parameter estimation, and diagnostic checking.
RESULTS: Stochastic scalar time series modelling of the varicella incidence from 1928 to 2019 was performed. The stochastic ARIMA (0,1,1) was identified to be the most appropriate model. The decomposition of varicella incidence time series into a stochastic trend and a stationary component was reasoned based on the model defined. In addition, we assessed the importance of the long-term and immediate effect of one shock. The long-term forecast was also under discussion.
CONCLUSIONS: The ARIMA model (0,1,1) in our study is an adequate tool for presenting the varicella incidence trend and is suitable to forecast near future disease dynamics with acceptable error tolerance.","['Raycheva R', 'Kevorkyan A', 'Stoilova Y']",2022,64,4,Folia Med (Plovdiv),"Raycheva R, et al.

36016439,Rapid Amplicon Nanopore Sequencing (RANS) for the Differential Diagnosis of Monkeypox Virus and Other Vesicle-Forming Pathogens.,"As of July 2022, more than 16,000 laboratory-confirmed monkeypox (MPX) cases have been reported worldwide. Until recently, MPX was a rare viral disease seldom detected outside Africa. MPX virus (MPXV) belongs to the Orthopoxvirus (OPV) genus and is a genetically close relative of the Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox). Following the eradication of smallpox, there was a significant decrease in smallpox-related morbidity and the population's immunity to other OPV-related diseases such as MPX. In parallel, there was a need for differential diagnosis between the different OPVs' clinical manifestations and diseases with similar symptoms (i.e., chickenpox, herpes simplex). The current study aimed to provide a rapid genetic-based diagnostic tool for accurate and specific identification of MPXV and additional related vesicle-forming pathogens. We initially assembled a list of 14 relevant viral pathogens, causing infectious diseases associated with vesicles, prone to be misdiagnosed as MPX. Next, we developed an approach that we termed rapid amplicon nanopore sequencing (RANS). The RANS approach uses diagnostic regions that harbor high homology in their boundaries and internal diagnostic SNPs that, when sequenced, aid the discrimination of each pathogen within a group. During a multiplex PCR amplification, a dA tail and a 5'-phosphonate were simultaneously added, thus making the PCR product ligation ready for nanopore sequencing. Following rapid sequencing (a few minutes), the reads were compared to a reference database and the nearest strain was identified. We first tested our approach using samples of known viruses cultured in cell lines. All the samples were identified correctly and swiftly. Next, we examined a variety of clinical samples from the 2022 MPX outbreak. Our RANS approach identified correctly all the PCR-positive MPXV samples and mapped them to strains that were sequenced during the 2022 outbreak. For the subset of samples that were negative for MPXV by PCR, we obtained definite results, identifying other vesicle-forming viruses: Human herpesvirus 3, Human herpesvirus 2, and Molluscum contagiosum virus. This work was a proof-of-concept study, demonstrating the potential of the RANS approach for rapid and discriminatory identification of a panel of closely related pathogens. The simplicity and affordability of our approach makes it straightforward to implement in any genetics lab. Moreover, other differential diagnostics panels might benefit from the implementation of the RANS approach into their diagnostics pipelines.","['Israeli O', 'Guedj-Dana Y', 'Shifman O', 'Lazar S', 'Cohen-Gihon I', 'Amit S', 'Ben-Ami R', 'Paran N', 'Schuster O', 'Weiss S', 'Zvi A', 'Beth-Din A']",2022,14,8,Viruses,"Israeli O, et al.

The initial VZV infection-more common in children-causes a self-limiting chicken pox. However, in later life, the latent VZV can become reactivated in these patients, causing HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a serious and painful complication. VZV glycoprotein E (gE) has been developed into a licensed subunit vaccine against HZ (Shingrix). However, its efficacy relies on the concomitant delivery of a robust adjuvant (AS01B). Here, we sought to create a new immunogen for vaccine design by displaying the VZV-gE on the baculovirus surface (Bac-gE). Correct localization and display of gE on the engineered baculovirus was verified by flow cytometry and immune electron microscopy. We show that Bac-gE provides excellent antigenicity against VZV and induces not only stronger gE-specific CD4","['Xue W', 'Li T', 'Zhang S', 'Wang Y', 'Hong M', 'Cui L', 'Wang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen T', 'Zhu R', 'Chen Z', 'Zhou L', 'Zhang R', 'Cheng T', 'Zheng Q', 'Zhang J', 'Gu Y', 'Xia N', 'Li S']",2022,14,8,Viruses,"Xue W, et al.

36004318,"Seropositivity, Risks, and Morbidity From Varicella-Zoster Virus Infections in an Adult PWH Cohort From 2000-2020.","BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection disproportionately affects people with HIV (PWH), primarily presenting as herpes zoster. However, VZV seroprevalence, its association with zoster, and clinical outcomes remain understudied in era of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed VZV seroprevalence, rates of VZV illness, and associated health care costs in a large cohort of PWH over 20 years.
METHODS: We performed retrospective chart reviews of patients followed at a regional HIV clinic from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2020. Serological, immunization, clinical, and costing data were extracted from in-house databases. VZV-related inpatient admissions, emergency department (ED), and urgent care (UC) visits were identified using relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes and validated where possible by 2 physicians. Health care utilization costs were adjusted to 2020 Canadian dollars.
RESULTS: Of 3006 PWH, VZV serology was available for 2628; of these, 2503 (95.2%) were seropositive. Only 39% of known seronegative patients were subsequently immunized for varicella. During 29 768 years of patient follow-up, 38 hospitalizations and 138 ED/UC visits due to VZV infection were identified. Most occurred in VZV-seropositive PWH <50 years of age (82%) who were unimmunized (99.2%) and not on ART (64.8%). Nearly 25% of hospitalizations were due to laboratory-confirmed VZV meningitis/encephalitis. The average admission cost was CDN$33 001; the total measured cost of VZV illness was CDN$1 258 718.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite ART and vaccines for chickenpox and shingles, VZV still caused significant costs and morbidity for PWH, occurring at younger ages and often as encephalitis/meningitis. Supporting ART adherence may reduce VZV illness and hospitalization costs in PWH, and the cost-effectiveness of expanding shingles vaccine use warrants further study.","['Zou J', 'Krentz HB', 'Lang R', 'Beckthold B', 'Fonseca K', 'Gill MJ']",2022,9,8,Open Forum Infect Dis,"Zou J, et al.

35998117,Thrombotic Microangiopathy Secondary to Disseminated Varicella Zoster Virus Infection in an Adult Patient.,"BACKGROUND Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a life-threatening condition caused by small-vessel platelet microthrombi. While various disease triggering factors, including infections, have been well described, there have been few reports of an association between TMA and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. VZV infection is rare among people age 20 and older, and infection-induced TMA is mostly reported in the pediatric age group. We report a case of TMA induced by a disseminated VZV infection in an adult. CASE REPORT A 43-year-old man presented with a 3-day duration of fever, headache, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. He also reported body rash after a recent contact with a few roommates with chickenpox. On presentation, the patient developed convulsive seizures. His laboratory test results were significant for acute kidney injury (AKI) and thrombocytopenia. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) were suspected but further diagnostic testing was negative. The treatment plan included acyclovir, therapeutic plasma exchange, and high-dose oral prednisolone (1.5 mg/kg). The clinical and biochemical profile significantly improved, and the patient was discharged home. CONCLUSIONS TMA is a life-threatening hematological emergency with a high mortality rate. Compared to the pediatric population, VZV infection tends to be more severe in the adult age group. This case demonstrates that a high index of suspicion for TMA in adult patients with VZV who present with thrombocytopenia, even when there is no definitive diagnosis, can result in early management with favorable outcome.","['Luqman N', 'Bakie R', 'Gaba WH', 'Athar S']",2022,23,,Am J Case Rep,"Luqman N, et al.

35985514,"Monkeypox in pregnancy: virology, clinical presentation, and obstetric management.","The 2022 monkeypox outbreak, caused by the zoonotic monkeypox virus, has spread across 6 World Health Organization regions (the Americas, Africa, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, and South-East Asia) and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on July 23, 2022. The global situation is especially concerning given the atypically high rate of person-to-person transmission, which suggests viral evolution to an established human pathogen. Pregnant women are at heightened risk of vertical transmission of the monkeypox virus because of immune vulnerability and natural depletion of population immunity to smallpox among reproductive-age women, and because orthopoxviral cell entry mechanisms can overcome the typically viral-resistant syncytiotrophoblast barrier within the placenta. Data on pregnancy outcomes following monkeypox infection are scarce but include reports of miscarriage, intrauterine demise, preterm birth, and congenital infection. This article forecasts the issues that maternity units might face and proposes guidelines to protect the health of pregnant women and fetuses exposed to the monkeypox virus. We review the pathophysiology and clinical features of monkeypox infection and discuss the obstetrical implications of the unusually high prevalence of anogenital lesions. We describe the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction tests from mucocutaneous and oropharyngeal sites to confirm infection, and share an algorithm for the antenatal management of pregnant women with monkeypox virus exposure. On the basis of the best available knowledge from prenatal orthopoxvirus infections, we discuss the sonographic features of congenital monkeypox and the role of invasive testing in establishing fetal infection. We suggest a protocol for cesarean delivery to avoid the horizontal transmission of the monkeypox virus at birth and address the controversy of mother-infant separation in the postpartum period. Obstetrical concerns related to antiviral therapy with tecovirimat and vaccinia immune globulin are highlighted, including the risks of heart rate-corrected QT-interval prolongation, inaccuracies in blood glucose monitoring, and the predisposition to iatrogenic venous thromboembolism. The possibility of monkeypox vaccine hesitancy during pregnancy is discussed, and strategies are offered to mitigate these risks. Finally, we conclude with a research proposal to address knowledge gaps related to the impact of monkeypox infection on maternal, fetal, and neonatal health.","['Dashraath P', 'Nielsen-Saines K', 'Rimoin A', 'Mattar CNZ', 'Panchaud A', 'Baud D']",2022,227,6,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"Dashraath P, et al.

Reactivation of varicella zoster virus has been associated with a wide range of neurological complications. Among the cranial nerves, the upper cranial nerves (trigeminal and facial nerves) are more commonly affected; there have been some reports of lower cranial polyneuropathies resulting from varicella zoster virus reactivation. However, polyneuropathy involving both the cranial and cervical nerves is rarely reported.

RESULTS: Over recent months, MPX has reemerged in more than 88 countries in Europe, North America, and Australia, with some 22000 case reports to date (as of July 2022). The initial signs of MPX appear during the prodromal period, in the oral cavity as single or multiple macular lesions on the oral mucosa, accompanied by generalised lymphadenopathy. Subsequently, the characteristic rash appears on the skin and spreads centripetally from the trunk towards the palms and soles. MPX is a self-limiting disease with very low mortality and may last from 2 to 4 weeks. Although MPX is similar to chickenpox, there are a number of differentiating signs, the main element being lymphadenopathy. Strict adherence to standard, contact, and droplet infection control precautions, including wearing N95 masks, FFP3 respirators, fluid-resistant attire, and eye protection, is necessary to prevent its spread.
CONCLUSIONS: MPX appears to be a significant travel-related disease. Dental care workers should note that premonitory signs of the disease usually appear on the oral mucosa as macules and ulcers prior to the characteristic skin lesions. Implementing standard, contact, and droplet infection control measures, patient isolation, and referral are important, particularly during a local outbreak. A vaccine specific for MPX is under development, although the smallpox vaccine appears to be effective.","['Samaranayake L', 'Anil S']",2022,72,5,Int Dent J,Samaranayake L and Anil S.

35923668,An Epidemiological Study of Outbreak Investigation of Chickenpox in Remote Hamlets of a Tribal State in India.,"BACKGROUND: Chickenpox is a benign, self-limiting disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that is transmitted from person to person with direct contact or airborne spread, which usually lasts for five to seven days. There was a sudden increase in the number of cases of fever along with rashes at two sites in Jharkhand, India. We aimed to survey and establish the etiology and investigate the extent of the disease.
METHODS: We defined the case of chickenpox as a person with acute onset of diffuse maculo-papulovesicular rash. From the clinically suspected cases, blood samples were collected and tested for anti-VZV immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies (depending on the clinical features) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Novatec Immundiagnostica GmbH, Dietzenbach, Germany). A detailed history was collected from each case including the history of contacts and immunization status.
RESULTS: The outbreak investigations were done at two villages of the two different blocks and one school in the Bharno block. According to the case definition, 16 persons were found affected by the varicella-zoster/chickenpox infection who belonged to five different households of Itkhori village in Chatra district. The age group varied from four to 45 years. The mean age was 20.28 years. Out of 16 cases, 10 (62.5%) cases complained of fever, rashes, and itching, two (12.5%) reported rashes and fever, and four (25%) complained of itching along with rashes. While at the Bharno block of Gumla district, out of 62 cases that fulfilled the case definition, 55 (88.7%) cases complained of fever, rashes, and itching, two (3.2%) reported itching and rashes, one (1.6%) reported vomiting along with fever and rashes, one (1.6%) complained about pain and rashes, one (1.6%) complained of cough with rashes, and four (25%) complained of itching along with rashes. There was neither any death nor any serious complication noted due to varicella.
CONCLUSION: Chickenpox is still widespread in Northern parts of India like Jharkhand. Most of the cases were self-limiting and recovered at the Itkhori block, while at the Bharno block, there were 20 active cases and the rest were either recovered or were still in the recovery phase.","['Kujur A', 'Kiran KA', 'Kujur M']",2022,14,6,Cureus,"Kujur A, et al.

35916400,A Variant Allele in Varicella-Zoster Virus Glycoprotein B Selected during Production of the Varicella Vaccine Contributes to Its Attenuation.,"Attenuation of the live varicella Oka vaccine (vOka) has been attributed to mutations in the genome acquired during cell culture passage of pOka (parent strain); however, the precise mechanisms of attenuation remain unknown. Comparative sequence analyses of several vaccine batches showed that over 100 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are conserved across all vaccine batches; 6 SNPs are nearly fixed, suggesting that these SNPs are responsible for attenuation. By contrast, prior analysis of chimeric vOka and pOka recombinants indicates that loci other than these six SNPs contribute to attenuation. Here, we report that pOka consists of a heterogenous population of virus sequences with two nearly equally represented bases, guanine (G) or adenine (A), at nucleotide 2096 of the ORF31 coding sequence, which encodes glycoprotein B (gB) resulting in arginine (R) or glutamine (Q), respectively, at amino acid 699 of gB. By contrast, 2096A/699Q is dominant in vOka (>99.98%). gB699Q/gH/gL showed significantly less fusion activity than gB699R/gH/gL in a cell-based fusion assay. Recombinant pOka with gB669Q (rpOka_gB699Q) had a similar growth phenotype as vOka during lytic infection in cell culture including human primary skin cells; however, rpOka_gB699R showed a growth phenotype similar to pOka. rpOka_gB699R entered neurons from axonal terminals more efficiently than rpOka_gB699Q in the presence of cell membrane-derived vesicles containing gB. Strikingly, when a mixture of pOka with both alleles equally represented was used to infect human neurons from axon terminals, pOka with gB699R was dominant for virus entry. These results identify a variant allele in gB that contributes to attenuation of vOka.

35891418,Silent Reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus in Pregnancy: Implications for Maintenance of Immunity to Varicella.,"We encountered two cases of varicella occurring in newborn infants. Because the time between birth and the onset of the illness was much shorter than the varicella incubation period, the cases suggested that the infection was maternally acquired, despite the fact that neither mother experienced clinical zoster. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that VZV frequently reactivates asymptomatically in late pregnancy. The appearance of DNA-encoding VZV genes in saliva was used as an indicator of reactivation. Saliva was collected from 5 women in the first and 14 women in the third trimesters of pregnancy and analyzed at two different sites, at one using nested PCR and at the other using quantitative PCR (qPCR). No VZV DNA was detected at either site in the saliva of women during the first trimester; however, VZV DNA was detected in the majority of samples of saliva (11/12 examined by nested PCR; 7/10 examined by qPCR) during the third trimester. These observations suggest that VZV reactivation occurs commonly during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is possible that this phenomenon, which remains in most patients below the clinical threshold, provides an endogenous boost to immunity and, thus, is beneficial.","['Mourad M', 'Gershon M', 'Mehta SK', 'Crucian BE', 'Hubbard N', 'Zhang J', 'Gershon A']",2022,14,7,Viruses,"Mourad M, et al.

The differential diagnosis includes a variety of infectious and non-infectious diseases, some of which can be life-threatening. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the quantity and type of skin lesions among outpatients and inpatients at a tertiary care university-affiliated teaching hospital for infectious diseases over a three-year period to assess disease burden and physicians' experience in diagnosing skin lesions. Diagnoses (by ICD-10 codes) were classified into three groups: infectious diseases that include skin lesions, non-infectious skin lesions and undiagnosed skin lesions. During the observed period, out of the total of 142,416 outpatients, 14.8% presented with some form of skin lesion. Among them, 68% had skin lesions inherent to infectious disease, 10.8% suffered from non-infectious skin lesions and 21.2% remained with undiagnosed skin lesions. The most common infectious diagnoses were chickenpox, herpes zoster and unspecified viral infections characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions. The most common non-infectious diagnoses were urticaria and atopic dermatitis.

This study aimed to examine the effect of one-dose UVV on the burden of varicella in Colombia. A retrospective study was conducted using national databases to estimate incidence and mortality for the target (1-4 years old), non-target (less than 1 and 5 years and older) and overall (all age groups) populations from the pre-UVV period (January 2008-June 2015) to the post-UVV period (July 2015-December 2019). A time-series analyses with ARIMA modeling was used to project expected varicella incidence and mortality in the absence of UVV in the post-UVV period. UVV impact was estimated by comparing predicted and observed values, providing point estimates and prediction intervals (PI). Overall vaccination coverage rate was over 90 % from 2016-2019. Following UVV introduction, mean annual incidence rates reduced from 743.6 to 676.8 per 100,000 in the target population and from 203.2 to 198.1 per 100,000 in the overall population.

We systematically review autonomic dysfunction due to VZV infection.
METHODS: This study followed the PRISMA guideline, and three databases were researched and included cross-sectional studies in full-length publications in the English language using appropriate search keywords.
RESULTS: A total of 102 articles were identified initially; finally 45 studies were used for review, comprising pupillomotor dysfunction in 4, sudomotor dysfunction in 2, cardiovascular dysfunction in 2, gastrointestinal dysfunction in 14, and urogenital dysfunction in 23. They can be summarized as (1) VZV infection rarely produces orthostatic hypotension, which involves diffuse sympathetic dysfunction by polyneuropathy. (2) In contrast, VZV infection produces dysfunction of the bladder and the bowel, which involves segmental parasympathetic or sympathetic dysfunction by dorsal root ganglionopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of VZV-related autonomic dysfunction is important, because such patients may first visit a gastroenterology or urology clinic. Close collaboration among neurologists, dermatologists, gastroenterologists, and urologists is important to start early antiviral agents and maximize bowel and bladder care in such patients.","['Sakakibara R', 'Sawai S', 'Ogata T']",2022,242,,Auton Neurosci,"Sakakibara R, et al.

METHODS: Households with at least one active generalized vesicular-pustular rash case were visited, and contact and clinical history information were collected from all household members. Whenever possible, skin lesions were screened by polymerase chain reaction for the monkeypox virus, followed by the varicella-zoster virus, when negative for the former.
RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction results were obtained for 77 suspected cases, distributed in 138 households, of which 27.3% were positive for monkeypox, 58.4% positive for chickenpox, and 14.3% negative for both. Confirmed monkeypox cases presented more often with monomorphic skin lesions on the palms of the hands and on the soles of the feet.

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre service evaluation of children with cancer who received either VZIG or aciclovir as PEP following significant exposure to varicella zoster virus (VZV) over a 24-month period from May 2018.
SETTING: Data were collected from 9 UK Paediatric Oncology Primary Treatment Centres.
PATIENTS: Children under 16 years old with a diagnosis of cancer and/or previous haematopoietic stem cell transplant who were VZV seronegative at exposure and/or diagnosis and received PEP following significant VZV exposure.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incidence of breakthrough varicella within 6 weeks of VZV exposure and treatment with PEP.
RESULTS: A total of 105 eligible patients were registered with a median age of 4.9 years (range 1.1-10.5 years). Underlying diagnoses were acute leukaemia (64), solid tumours (22), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (9), central nervous system (CNS) tumours (8) and other (2).

35791013,Describing the population experiencing COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough following second vaccination in England: a cohort study from OpenSAFELY.,"BACKGROUND: While the vaccines against COVID-19 are highly effective, COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough is possible despite being fully vaccinated. With SARS-CoV-2 variants still circulating, describing the characteristics of individuals who have experienced COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs could be hugely important in helping to determine who may be at greatest risk.
METHODS: With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine clinical data from the OpenSAFELY-TPP database of fully vaccinated individuals, linked to secondary care and death registry data and described the characteristics of those experiencing COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs.
RESULTS: As of 1st November 2021, a total of 15,501,550 individuals were identified as being fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with a median follow-up time of 149 days (IQR: ​107-179). From within this population, a total of 579,780 (<4%) individuals reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For every 1000 years of patient follow-up time, the corresponding incidence rate (IR) was 98.06 (95% CI 97.93-98.19). There were 28,580 COVID-19-related hospital admissions, 1980 COVID-19-related critical care admissions and 6435 COVID-19-related deaths; corresponding IRs 4.77 (95% CI 4.74-4.80), 0.33 (95% CI 0.32-0.34) and 1.07 (95% CI 1.06-1.09), respectively. The highest rates of breakthrough COVID-19 were seen in those in care homes and in patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis, transplant, haematological malignancy or who were immunocompromised.
CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases in England were mild, some differences in rates of breakthrough cases have been identified in several clinical groups. While it is important to note that these findings are simply descriptive and cannot be used to answer why certain groups have higher rates of COVID-19 breakthrough than others, the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 coupled with the number of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests still occurring is concerning and as numbers of fully vaccinated (and boosted) individuals increases and as follow-up time lengthens, so too will the number of COVID-19 breakthrough cases. Additional analyses, to assess vaccine waning and rates of breakthrough COVID-19 between different variants, aimed at identifying individuals at higher risk, are needed.","['OpenSAFELY Collaborative', 'Green A', 'Curtis H', 'Hulme W', 'Williamson E', 'McDonald H', 'Bhaskaran K', 'Rentsch C', 'Schultze A', 'MacKenna B', 'Mahalingasivam V', 'Tomlinson L', 'Walker A', 'Fisher L', 'Massey J', 'Andrews C', 'Hopcroft L', 'Morton C', 'Croker R', 'Morley J', 'Mehrkar A', 'Bacon S', 'Evans D', 'Inglesby P', 'Hickman G', 'Ward T', 'Davy S', 'Mathur R', 'Tazare J', 'Eggo R', 'Wing K', 'Wong A', 'Forbes H', 'Bates C', 'Cockburn J', 'Parry J', 'Hester F', 'Harper S', 'Douglas I', 'Evans S', 'Smeeth L', 'Goldacre B']",2022,20,1,BMC Med,"OpenSAFELY Collaborative, et al.

This study investigated the effect of vaccine programs on the immunity of people in Japan.
METHODS: Immunoglobulin G antibody (IgG) titers against four viruses were determined by enzyme immunoassay in 795 students at a medical university. Titers for measles and rubella were compared according to the students' birth dates (Group 1: April 2, 1990-April 1, 2000; Group 2: April 2, 2000).
RESULTS: The titers of students that satisfied the standard IgG values against measles, rubella, varicella, and mumps were 24.3%, 56.9%, 87.4%, and 47.2%, respectively. Measles and rubella titers were lower in group 2 (estimated mean period from last vaccination, 7.0 years) than group 1 (13.5 years) (p = 0.023 measles, p = 0.037 rubella), indicating attenuation of titers over time. Varicella and mumps antibody prevalence indicated that these infections were endemic, whereas rates of negative titers were higher than those for measles and rubella.
CONCLUSIONS: IgG titers against viruses were affected by vaccination programs. Declining titers after vaccination should be monitored when the diseases are almost eliminated and boosting is absent. Antibody testing is meaningful for recommending vaccinations and for surveillance of waning immunity. Continuous improvements of vaccination program should be considered to prevent and eliminate diseases.","['Miyazaki H', 'Yamanaka G', 'Furukawa K', 'Ichiki M']",2022,28,10,J Infect Chemother,"Miyazaki H, et al.

35772068,"Varicella outbreaks in schools and kindergartens in Shanghai, China from 2011 to 2020.","BACKGROUND: Varicella is a contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus and varicella vaccine (VarV) is the most effective way to prevent and control varicella. Despite high VarV coverage there were still varicella outbreaks in schools and kindergartens. We aim to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of varicella outbreaks in Huangpu District, Shanghai, China from 2011 to 2020.
METHODS: For varicella outbreaks, case information and vaccination history were collected. Mann-Kendall test and descriptive methods were used to analyzed the trend and epidemiological catachrestic of varicella outbreaks.
RESULTS: A total of 57 varicella outbreaks were reported from 2011 to 2020, including 30 outbreaks (52.6%) in primary schools. The results of the Mann-Kendall trend test (z = 1.97, p = 0.049) showed an upward trend in the number of cases during the study period, but the trend change was not statistically significant. Emergency vaccination was carried out in 42 (73.7%) outbreaks which influenced the duration of the epidemic (F = 4.53, p = 0.0379). A total of 573 varicella cases were reported, including 357 cases (62.3%) who had received at least one dose of varicella vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of varicella outbreaks has not changed significantly in the decade from 2011 to 2020. The strategy of varicella vaccination, the development and application of varicella vaccine, and the control measures after the occurrence of varicella outbreaks need to be optimized. In addition to vaccination, as a disease transmitted by contact, quarantine measures, good personal hygiene, environmental disinfection, and ventilation are also important.","['Wang J', 'Xu Z', 'Gao Q']",2022,17,6,PLoS One,"Wang J, et al.

35763688,Overlapping Signs and Symptoms Between Recurrent Varicella and Pityriasis rosea Gibert.,"BACKGROUND: Pityriasis rosea Gibert (PRG) has features similar to those of common infectious childhood diseases, suggesting a viral cause, but no agent has been identified to date. We describe 4 children with PRG and 2 with recurrent varicella who were studied using photochronography, virology and immunology.
METHODS: The 6 patients with skin rashes visited our pediatric clinic from April 2012 to May 2016. Photographs of their skin lesions were taken; blood, skin lesions, and/or nasal lavage samples were collected to detect varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA and antibodies; and skin tests were carried out to measure cell-mediated immunity to VZV.
RESULTS: Herald patches were confirmed in 2 of 4 PRG patients. No specimen cultures were positive for infectious VZV. However, VZV-DNA was detected in skin lesions of 3 PRG patients. During the acute phase, 5 patients had IgG antibodies to VZV, and skin-test reactions were positive in 5 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: IgG antibody titers to VZV at rash onset were high, suggesting that they were already rising at the appearance of the rash and that reinfection with VZV must have occurred during the prodromal stage or several weeks before rash appearance in PRG patients whose immunity had declined below the threshold. Our study suggests a new pathogenesis of PRG that might help to address incongruities of past theories on PRG sites of viral entry and replication, incubation period and variations in the clinical course of PRG from prodrome to healing.","['Baba K', 'Baba T', 'Ogra PL', 'Okuno T']",2022,41,9,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Baba K, et al.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) adopted the routine administration of varicella vaccine to varicella non-immune mothers postpartum before leaving the facility per the Advisory Committee in Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation of Varicella prevention. While the vaccine is well-tolerated, a live attenuated vaccine has the potential to cause clinical symptoms and complications, including rash. Secondary transmission of the vaccine virus from healthy persons is rare. Only 13 confirmed cases of secondary transmission from 11 immunocompetent vaccine recipients have been reported. We report the confirmed case of extensive neonatal varicella disease in a neonate after exposure to a vaccine varicella rash that developed after maternal postpartum vaccination.","['Saringkarisate K', 'Len KA', 'Melish ME', 'Prothero BK', 'Ching N']",2022,11,10,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,"Saringkarisate K, et al.

35749342,Recognition & management of varicella infections and accuracy of antimicrobial recommendations: Case vignettes study in the US.,"BACKGROUND: In 1995, the CDC recommended one-dose routine varicella immunization for children <12 years of age, expanding its recommendation to two doses in 2006. Today, with widespread varicella vaccination coverage, an estimated 3.5 million cases of varicella, 9,000 hospitalizations, and 100 deaths are prevented annually in the United States. Since varicella infections are now uncommon, health care providers (HCPs) may not recognize varicella infections and may prescribe inappropriate treatment.
METHODS: An online survey of HCPs was conducted to assess recognition and management of varicella infections. Responses to eight varicella vignettes describing patients with varying varicella symptoms were analyzed and descriptive analyses performed. Stratified analysis comparing responses of those licensed before and in/after 1996 was also performed.
RESULTS: 153 HCPs (50 nurse practitioners, 103 doctors) completed the survey. Mean age of respondents was 44 years. 62% were female, and 82% were licensed before 1996. Varicella infection was correctly diagnosed 79% of the time. HCPs correctly recognized uncomplicated varicella vignettes 85% of the time versus 61% of the time for complicated varicella vignettes. Antibiotics were recommended 17% of the time and antivirals 18% of the time, of which 25% and 69% (respectively) were not appropriate per guidelines. HCPs licensed before 1996 were better able to recognize varicella compared to those licensed later, but prescribed more antimicrobials medications to treat varicella.
CONCLUSIONS: Although most HCPs recognized varicella infection, a sizable proportion could not recognize cases with complications, and some of the varicella cases were inappropriately treated with antibiotics and/or antivirals. Additional HCP training and high vaccination coverage are important strategies to avoid inaccurate diagnoses and minimize unnecessary exposure to antimicrobial/antiviral therapies.","['Fergie J', 'Pawaskar M', 'Veeranki P', 'Samant S', 'Harley C', 'MacEwan J', 'Schwartz TT', 'Surati S', 'Conway JH']",2022,17,6,PLoS One,"Fergie J, et al.

35743492,Evaluation of Atopic Dermatitis and Cutaneous Infectious Disorders Using Sequential Pattern Mining: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.,"According to previous studies, the increased risk of cutaneous infectious disorders in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is related to impaired epidermal function, abnormal systemic immune function, and lower antimicrobial peptides. In this study, we analyzed the association between AD and cutaneous infectious disorders in the real world using sequential pattern mining (SPM). We analyzed National Health Insurance data from 2010-2013 using SPM to identify comorbid cutaneous infectious diseases and the onset durations of comorbidities. Patients with AD were at greater risk for molluscum contagiosum (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 5.273), impetigo (aOR, 2.852), chickenpox (aOR, 2.251), otitis media (aOR, 1.748), eczema herpeticum (aOR, 1.292), and viral warts (aOR, 1.105). In SPM analysis, comorbidity of 1.06% shown in molluscum contagiosum was the highest value, and the duration of 77.42 days documented for molluscum contagiosum was the shortest onset duration among all the association rules. This study suggests that AD is associated with an increased risk of cutaneous infectious disorders. In particular, care should be taken regarding its high relevance with impetigo, molluscum contagiosum, and otitis media, which may help in preventing AD from worsening through appropriately preventing and managing the condition.","['Han JH', 'Yoon JW', 'Yook HJ', 'Bang CH', 'Chun JH', 'Lee JY', 'Park YM', 'Lee SJ', 'Lee JH']",2022,11,12,J Clin Med,"Han JH, et al.

35740153,Decreased Antibiotic Consumption Coincided with Reduction in Bacteremia Caused by Bacterial Species with Respiratory Transmission Potential during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020−2021) have provided a unique opportunity to understand their impact on the wholesale supply of antibiotics and incidences of infections represented by bacteremia due to common bacterial species in Hong Kong. The wholesale antibiotic supply data (surrogate indicator of antibiotic consumption) and notifications of scarlet fever, chickenpox, and tuberculosis collected by the Centre for Health Protection, and the data of blood cultures of patients admitted to public hospitals in Hong Kong collected by the Hospital Authority for the last 10 years, were tabulated and analyzed. A reduction in the wholesale supply of antibiotics was observed. This decrease coincided with a significant reduction in the incidence of community-onset bacteremia due to Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, which are encapsulated bacteria with respiratory transmission potential. This reduction was sustained during two pandemic years (period 2: 2020−2021), compared with eight pre-pandemic years (period 1: 2012−2019). Although the mean number of patient admissions per year (1,704,079 vs. 1,702,484, p = 0.985) and blood culture requests per 1000 patient admissions (149.0 vs. 158.3, p = 0.132) were not significantly different between periods 1 and 2, a significant reduction in community-onset bacteremia due to encapsulated bacteria was observed in terms of the mean number of episodes per year (257 vs. 58, p < 0.001), episodes per 100,000 admissions (15.1 vs. 3.4, p < 0.001), and per 10,000 blood culture requests (10.1 vs. 2.1, p < 0.001), out of 17,037,598 episodes of patient admissions with 2,570,164 blood culture requests. Consistent with the findings of bacteremia, a reduction in case notification of scarlet fever and airborne infections, including tuberculosis and chickenpox, was also observed; however, there was no reduction in the incidence of hospital-onset bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. Sustained implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions against respiratory microbes may reduce the overall consumption of antibiotics, which may have a consequential impact on antimicrobial resistance. Rebound of conventional respiratory microbial infections is likely with the relaxation of these interventions.","['Cheng VC', 'Wong SC', 'So SY', 'Chen JH', 'Chau PH', 'Au AK', 'Chiu KH', 'Li X', 'Ip P', 'Chuang VW', 'Lung DC', 'Tse CW', 'Lee RA', 'Fung KS', 'To WK', 'Lai RW', 'Que TL', 'Lo JY', 'Yuen KY']",2022,11,6,Antibiotics (Basel),"Cheng VC, et al.

35735308,[Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus presenting as acute headache].,"UNLABELLED: Herpes Zoster (HZ) is rare in childhood and is defined as the reactivation of the latent varicella-zoster virus in patients who have previously been infected with varicella. When the virus affects the ophthal mic nerve it is called herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) and it can produce, among other symptoms, acute headache, so it must be considered as a differential diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a clinical case of HZO in a pediatric patient and to recognize its clinical manifestations and their importance in the differential diagnosis of acute headache in children.
CLINICAL CASE: Immunocompetent 11-year- old girl, vaccinated according to the recommended immunization schedule, excluding chickenpox vaccine due to past infection, presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 5-day long uni lateral headache. After 36 hours of hospitalization, she presented vesicular cutaneous lesions in her forehead, left upper eyelid, and nose. Positive fluorescein stain dendritic corneal lesions were iden tified in the ophthalmic exam. Antiviral systemic and topic therapy were set, obtaining an initial good response, but later she presented complications such as postherpetic neuralgia one month after hospital discharge and several postherpetic neuralgia episodes despite treatment with gabapentin in addition to two herpes zoster ophthalmicus relapses with acute keratouveitis one year after the initial episode.
CONCLUSION: It is essential to include HZO in the differential diagnosis of acute headache, especially when presented unilaterally and/or with ocular symptoms, regardless of the presence of cutaneous lesions, and even more so in patients with history of chickenpox infection. Those patients who were vaccinated against this disease in their childhood will benefit from at least partial protection against HZO.","['Marco Campos S', 'Tormo Alcañiz MT', 'Vilaplana Mora I', 'Almiñana Almiñana AJ', 'Angelats Romero CM']",2022,93,2,Andes Pediatr,"Marco Campos S, et al.

However, there are no data on general vaccine uptake for this group in New Zealand. Additionally, the importance of ECE staff vaccination as a strategy to prevent illness has been rarely promoted in the past, and recommendations for other vaccinations in this group are lacking. Here we present a section of data accessed from an ECE-sector employment survey of more than 4,000 teaching staff, which inquired into the immunisation status of respondents. The data indicated that self-reported immunisation coverage for whooping cough, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B among ECE staff was approximately 50%. Self-reported immunisation status was higher for measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox in this group. The findings highlight the need for more comprehensive vaccination policy and research in ECE settings.","['Prasad N', 'Turner N', 'Alexander S']",2022,135,1548,N Z Med J,"Prasad N, et al.

35714279,Evaluation of vaccination status of health care workers for recommended vaccines and their acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.,"INTRODUCTION: Health care workers (HCWs) are disproportionately exposed to infectious diseases and play a role in nosocomial transmission, making them a key demographic for vaccination. HCW vaccination rates are not optimal in many countries; hence, compulsory vaccination policies have been implemented in some countries. Although these policies are effective and necessary under certain conditions, resolving HCWs' hesitancies and misconceptions about vaccines is crucial. HCWs have the advantage of direct contact with patients; hence, they can respond to safety concerns, explain the benefits of vaccination, and counter antivaccine campaigns that escalate during pandemics, as has been observed with COVID-19.
METHOD: A short survey was carried out in May-June 2020 on the vaccination status of HCWs working with pediatric patients with COVID-19. The survey inquired about their vaccination status (mumps/measles/rubella [MMR], varicella, influenza, and diphtheria/tetanus [dT]) and willingness to receive hypothetical future COVID-19 vaccines. The respondents were grouped according to gender, age, occupation, and region.
RESULTS: In total, 4927 HCWs responded to the survey. Most were young, healthy adults. The overall vaccination rates were 57.8% for dT in the past 10 years, 44.5% for MMR, 33.2% for varicella, and 13.5% for influenza. Vaccination rates were the highest among physicians. The majority of HCWs (81%) stated that they would be willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines.
CONCLUSION: Although vaccination rates for well-established vaccines were low, a majority of HCWs were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines when available. Education and administrative trust should be enhanced to increase vaccination rates among HCWs.","['Oygar PD', 'Büyükçam A', 'Sahbudak Bal Z', 'Dalgıç N', 'Bozdemir ŞE', 'Karbuz A', 'Çetin BŞ', 'Kara Y', 'Çetin C', 'Hatipoğlu N', 'Uygun H', 'Aygün FD', 'Hançerli Törün S', 'Şener Okur D', 'Yılmaz Çiftdoğan D', 'Tural Kara T', 'Yahşi A', 'Özer A', 'Öcal Demir S', 'Akkoç G', 'Turan C', 'Salı E', 'Şen S', 'Erdeniz EH', 'Kara SS', 'Emiroğlu M', 'Erat T', 'Aktürk H', 'Laçinel Gürlevik S', 'Sütçü M', 'Gayretli Aydın ZG', 'Yıldız Atikan B', 'Yeşil E', 'Güner Özenen G', 'Çelebi E', 'Efe K', 'Kizmaz Isancli D', 'Selver Durmuş H', 'Tekeli S', 'Karaaslan A', 'Bülbül L', 'Almış H', 'Kaba Ö', 'Ekemen Keleş Y', 'Yazıcıoğlu B', 'Bahtiyar Oğuz S', 'Ovalı HF', 'Doğan HH', 'Çelebi S', 'Çakir D', 'Karasulu B', 'Alkan G', 'Yenidoğan İ', 'Gül D', 'Parıltan Kücükalioğlu B', 'Avcu G', 'Kukul MG', 'Bilen M', 'Yaşar B', 'Üstün T', 'Kılıç Ö', 'Akın Y', 'Oral Cebeci S', 'Bucak İH', 'Sarı Yanartaş M', 'Şahin A', 'Arslanoglu S', 'Elevli M', 'Çoban R', 'Tuter Öz SK', 'Hatipoğlu H', 'Erkum İT', 'Turgut M', 'Demirbuğa A', 'Özçelik T', 'Çiftçi D', 'Sarı EE', 'Akkuş G', 'Hatipoğlu SS', 'Dinleyici EC', 'Hacimustafaoğlu M', 'Özkınay F', 'Kurugöl Z', 'Cengiz AB', 'Somer A', 'Tezer H', 'Kara A']",2022,18,5,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Oygar PD, et al.

35713564,Relative efficacy of varicella vaccines: network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE: Although varicella vaccination is highly effective, no head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of different vaccine formulations. This study assessed the relative efficacy of different varicella vaccines using network meta-analysis (NMA).
METHODS: We estimated the relative efficacies of varicella vaccines and dosing regimens from RCTs using Bayesian NMA. Modeling-based time-series NMA (MBNMA) was performed, accounting for differences in time since vaccination, to extrapolate long-term vaccine efficacy (VE).
RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included based on systematic review of biomedical databases. Efficacy data were reported for four varicella-containing vaccines: Varivax (V-MSD, one and two dose), Varilrix (V-GSK, one dose), Priorix-Tetra (MMRV-GSK, one dose), and Sinovac (V-Sinovac, one dose). All varicella vaccines were effective versus no vaccination. Two-dose V-MSD (98.29%, 95% credible interval [CrI] 96.08-99.23) showed significantly higher VE versus all one-dose varicella-containing vaccines, but no significant difference versus two-dose MMRV-GSK (95.19%, 95% CrI 90.3-97.63). Two-dose MMRV-GSK showed higher VE than one-dose V-GSK (66.47%; 95% CrI 43.02-79.43), but no significant differences in VE versus one-dose V-MSD or one-dose V-Sinovac. In one-dose comparisons, V-MSD showed significantly higher VE (93.09%, 95% CrI 89.13-95.96) than V-GSK, but no significant difference versus V-Sinovac (89.22%; 95% CrI 67.1-96.5). MBNMA indicated that protection against varicella was sustained without waning over the 10 year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported higher VE for two-dose V-MSD and MMRV-GSK. Among one-dose formulations, one-dose V-MSD was more efficacious than one-dose V-GSK. Policymakers should take into consideration differences in VE when implementing one- versus two-dose strategies in universal vaccination programs.","['Pawaskar M', 'Siddiqui MK', 'Takyar J', 'Sharma A', 'Fergie J']",2022,38,10,Curr Med Res Opin,"Pawaskar M, et al.

35704399,Estimation of single-dose varicella vaccine effectiveness in South Korea using mathematical modeling.,"In South Korea, despite the implementation of a universal single-dose vaccination program for children aged 12-15 months in 2005, the varicella incidence rate remains significant. Prior case-control studies have reported that currently used varicella vaccines are extremely inefficacious. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) by fitting a dynamic transmission model to age-specific varicella incidence data from 2007 to 2015 and available vaccine coverage data. The initial vaccine efficacy and primary failure rates were estimated to be 61.1% and 38.9%, respectively. The average duration of protection was 21.4 years.

35703724,COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations in children and adolescents: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cutaneous manifestations described in pediatric patients and discuss their relevance for early diagnosis.
DATA SOURCE: The study consisted of a systematic review of original articles indexed in PubMed and Embase databases, as well as gray literature articles found through Google Scholar. A search strategy, based on PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) Tool, with the terms ""child,"" ""infant,"" ""childhood,"" ""adolescents,"" ""teenagers,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" and ""skin manifestations,"" was performed to optimize the findings. The study did not restrict any article regarding language.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Out of the 310 articles that initially met the inclusion criteria, 35 were selected for review, totalizing 369 patients. The most common COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations in children and adolescents were Chilblain-like lesions, presented in 67.5% of the cases, followed by erythema multiforme-like (31.7%) and varicella-like lesions (0.8%). The Chilblain-like lesions appeared 7.6 days (95%CI 7.4-7.8) after the viral infection and lasted for 17.5 days (95%CI 16.5-18.5), erythema multiforme-like lesions appeared in 9.5 days (95%CI 9-10) and lasted for 10.3 days (95%CI 9.1-11.5), and varicella-like lesions appeared in 12.3 days (95%CI 4-20.6) and lasted for 7 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the different skin manifestations in children and adolescents with COVID-19 is essential for an early diagnosis and, consequently, the possibility of promptly care adoption as well as to interrupt the new coronavirus transmission chains in the current pandemic context.","['Pasquini Neto R', 'Mazzo FAT', 'Vieira FA', 'Bueno GS', 'Previdi JVC', 'Silva LRD', 'Silva NKBD', 'Jorizzo JL', 'Cerci FB']",2022,40,,Rev Paul Pediatr,"Pasquini Neto R, et al.

35699560,The Italian Mandatory Notification System: An Important Public Health Tool For Continuous Monitoring Of Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases still register significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Surveillance through a mandatory notification system allows the continuous analysis of the situation even at a local level and its importance has been highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aimed to outline the importance of the mandatory notification system as a Public Health tool in the continuous monitoring of infectious diseases. To this aim, we carried out a cross-sectional study examining the notifications reported in the Italian territory of Messina, Sicily, in the period 2001-2020. The institutional websites were examined and the notification data were used to obtain the incidences. Overall, a significant reduction of the incidence notification trend was observed. Chickenpox was by far the most notified infectious disease, followed by scabies, pediculosis, and brucellosis. Outbreaks of brucellosis, measles and hepatitis A occurred. All the diseases decreased over time, except syphilis, for which a significant increase was observed. Surveillance of infectious diseases through a mandatory notification system remains a bulwark of public health despite underreporting. Our study reflects the situation of a typical high-income area, although some unexpected criticisms are highlighted. Continuous information about correct behaviors through education campaigns are crucial in order to improve the situation.

35689946,Different levels of humoral and cellular immunity to varicella-zoster virus in seropositive healthcare workers.,"BACKGROUND: There have been occasional reports on varicella infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) despite varicella-zoster virus (VZV) seropositivity. We compared the levels of humoral and cellular immunity to VZV in seropositive HCWs who had acquired immunity by natural infection or vaccination.
METHODS: Seropositive healthy HCWs with an apparent history of varicella or VZV vaccination once or twice were recruited. Their samples were assessed for anti-VZV IgG levels, the relative avidity index (RAI), and the frequencies of VZV-specific cytokine-producing or polyfunctional CD4
RESULTS: A total of 75 seropositive HCWs (29 with a history of varicella, 25 vaccinated once, and 21 vaccinated twice) were assessed for humoral immunity. Cellular responses could be analyzed in 59 (28, 21, and 10 in the respective groups). The anti-VZV IgG level, RAI, and memory CD4
CONCLUSION: Seropositive HCWs without a varicella history, especially those who received the vaccine only once, had significantly lower levels of immune responses to VZV.

35687559,Impact of universal varicella vaccination on the use and cost of antibiotics and antivirals for varicella management in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: Our objective was to estimate the impact of universal varicella vaccination (UVV) on the use and costs of antibiotics and antivirals for the management of varicella among children in the United States (US).
METHODS: A decision tree model of varicella vaccination, infections and treatment decisions was developed. Results were extrapolated to the 2017 population of 73.5 million US children. Model parameters were populated from published sources. Treatment decisions were derived from a survey of health care professionals' recommendations. The base case modelled current vaccination coverage rates in the US with additional scenarios analyses conducted for 0%, 20%, and 80% coverage and did not account for herd immunity benefits.
RESULTS: Our model estimated that 551,434 varicella cases occurred annually among children ≤ 18 years in 2017. Antivirals or antibiotics were prescribed in 23.9% of cases, with unvaccinated children receiving the majority for base case. The annual cost for varicella antiviral and antibiotic treatment was approximately $14 million ($26 per case), with cases with no complications accounting for $12 million. Compared with the no vaccination scenario, the current vaccination rates resulted in savings of $181 million (94.7%) for antivirals and $78 million (95.0%) for antibiotics annually. Scenario analyses showed that higher vaccination coverage (from 0% to 80%) resulted in reduced annual expenditures for antivirals (from $191 million to $41 million), and antibiotics ($82 million to $17 million).
CONCLUSIONS: UVV was associated with significant reductions in the use of antibiotics and antivirals and their associated costs in the US. Higher vaccination coverage was associated with lower use and costs of antibiotics and antivirals for varicella management.","['Pawaskar M', 'Fergie J', 'Harley C', 'Samant S', 'Veeranki P', 'Diaz O', 'Conway JH']",2022,17,6,PLoS One,"Pawaskar M, et al.

35679996,Neurexin 3α in the Central Amygdala has a Role in Orofacial Varicella Zoster Pain.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is responsible for chronic pain. VZV injection has similarities to herpes zoster (HZ) ""shingles"" pain in humans. In this study orofacial pain was induced by injecting male rats with the human VZV. The amygdala and parabrachial have been implicated to control affective/motivational orofacial pain. Recently our lab reported neurexin 3α (Nrxn3α) is expressed in the central amygdala and parabrachial. GABAergic neurons descend from the central amygdala to the lateral parabrachial region and Nrxn3α is important for presynaptic (γ-Aminobutyric acid) GABA release. Thus, we hypothesized that lateral parabrachial neuronal activity and orofacial pain are controlled by Nrxn3α within the central amygdala. To test the hypothesis Nrxn3α expression was knocked down (i.e., using short hairpin RNA or shRNA) in the central amygdala and GABA release and neuronal activity were quantitated in the parabrachial concomitant with measurement of the VZV induced pain response. Results revealed that attenuating Nrxn3 expression within the amygdala reduces GABA release in the parabrachial and increases neuronal activity within the lateral parabrachial region. Attenuating Nrxn3 expression also increases VZV associated orofacial pain. Activating GABAergic neurons within the central amygdala with opsins increase GABA release in the parabrachial and reduced the pain response after Nrxn3 shRNA treatment. These results are consistent with the idea that Nrxn3 within the central amygdala controls VZV associated pain by regulating GABA release in the lateral parabrachial that then controls the activity of ascending pain neurons.","['Kramer PR', 'Umorin M', 'Hornung R', 'Kinchington PR']",2022,496,,Neuroscience,"Kramer PR, et al.

35670106,Varicella-Zoster virus ORF9 is an antagonist of the DNA sensor cGAS.,"Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. Although the infection is associated with severe morbidity in some individuals, molecular mechanisms that determine innate immune responses remain poorly defined. We found that the cGAS/STING DNA sensing pathway was required for type I interferon (IFN) induction during VZV infection and that recognition of VZV by cGAS restricted its replication. Screening of a VZV ORF expression library identified the essential VZV tegument protein ORF9 as a cGAS antagonist. Ectopically or virally expressed ORF9 bound to endogenous cGAS leading to reduced type I IFN responses to transfected DNA. Confocal microscopy revealed co-localisation of cGAS and ORF9. ORF9 and cGAS also interacted directly in a cell-free system and phase-separated together with DNA. Furthermore, ORF9 inhibited cGAMP production by cGAS. Taken together, these results reveal the importance of the cGAS/STING DNA sensing pathway for VZV recognition and identify a VZV immune antagonist that partially but directly interferes with DNA sensing via cGAS.","['Hertzog J', 'Zhou W', 'Fowler G', 'Rigby RE', 'Bridgeman A', 'Blest HT', 'Cursi C', 'Chauveau L', 'Davenne T', 'Warner BE', 'Kinchington PR', 'Kranzusch PJ', 'Rehwinkel J']",2022,41,14,EMBO J,"Hertzog J, et al.

35660037,Comparison of performance of varicella vaccines via infectious disease modeling.,"BACKGROUND: Population-level infectious disease models for varicella require vaccine parameters, namely 'take' and 'duration of protection' (defined here as vaccine performance), to quantify the impact of vaccination. Current published models for varicella use vaccine parameters derived from various methodologies which does not allow for the direct comparison of different vaccines.
METHODS: We estimated take and duration of protection using deterministic compartmental models to simulate clinical trials of one- or two-dose varicella vaccination using Varivax® (V-MSD) and Varilrix® (V-GSK). We fit different models to clinical trial data on breakthrough infections and evaluated their respective goodness-of-fit using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
RESULTS: Based upon the clinical trial data, we estimated that 90.3% (95% CI: 87.8-92.9%) of the cohort gained permanent protection from breakthrough varicella after the first dose of V-MSD compared to 61.7% (95% CI: 58.2-65.3%) with the first dose of V-GSK. We further estimated that a total of 97.0% (95% CI: 95.2-98.8%) and 93.8% (95% CI: 92.2-95.4%) of the cohort were permanently protected after two-doses of V-MSD and V-GSK, respectively. According to the AIC, our new model (V-MSD AIC = 92.7; V-GSK AIC = 170.3) provided a better fit than an existing model (V-MSD AIC = 108.9; V-GSK AIC = 216.1).
CONCLUSIONS: The model developed fits the long-term clinical trial data on breakthrough infections for both V-MSD and V-GSK, thus, allowing for the direct comparison of vaccine performance. We estimated that a single dose of V-MSD was more likely to provide permanent protection than a single dose of V-GSK, while the protection offered by two doses was similar for both vaccines.","['Pillsbury M', 'Carias C', 'Samant S', 'Greenberg D', 'Pawaskar M']",2022,40,29,Vaccine,"Pillsbury M, et al.

35659543,Effectiveness of oral aciclovir in preventing maternal chickenpox: A comparison with VZIG.,"OBJECTIVES: Although often presenting as a self-limiting childhood disease, chickenpox can have serious consequences if acquired in pregnancy. Until April 2022, the UK recommendations were that varicella immunoglobulin (VZIG) should be administered intramuscularly to susceptible pregnant women exposed to chickenpox prior to 20 weeks gestation. Oral aciclovir or VZIG was recommended if exposure occurred at 20+ weeks gestation. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of oral aciclovir to VZIG in preventing maternal and neonatal chickenpox.
METHODS: We identified and followed up 186 pregnant women who were exposed to chickenpox and compared their outcomes.
RESULTS: 171/186 (91.9%) of these women received either VZIG or oral aciclovir. Of the 145 women who received VZIG, 53/145 (36.6%) went on to develop chickenpox compared to 8 of the 26 (30.8%) women who received oral aciclovir (p = 0.32). No statistical difference was found between the oral aciclovir and VZIG groups even after controlling for maternal age, gestational stage, type of exposure and IgG titre (adjusted OR:0.83; 95%CI:0.26-2.65; p = 0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of oral aciclovir as first-line prophylaxis in pregnant women exposed to varicella as they suggest its effectiveness at preventing maternal chickenpox is either better or equal to VZIG.","['Sile B', 'Brown KE', 'Gower C', 'Bosowski J', 'Dennis A', 'Falconer M', 'Stowe J', 'Andrews N', 'Amirthalingam G']",2022,85,2,J Infect,"Sile B, et al.

35658899,Immunological characteristics of MAV/06 strain of varicella-zoster virus vaccine in an animal model.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a pathogen that causes chickenpox and shingles in humans. Different types of the varicella vaccines derived from the Oka and MAV/06 strains are commercially available worldwide. Although the MAV/06 vaccine was introduced in 1990s, little was known about immunological characteristics.
RESULTS: Here, we evaluated B and T cell immune response in animals inoculated with the Oka and MAV/06 vaccines as well as a new formulation of the MAV/06 vaccine. A variety of test methods were applied to evaluate T and B cell immune response. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) assay were conducted to measure the MAV/06 vaccine-induced antibody activity against various VZVs. Glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) was used to compare the degree of the antibody responses induced by the two available commercial VZV vaccines and the MAV/06 vaccine. Interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (IFN-γ ELISpot) assays and cytokine bead array (CBA) assays were conducted to investigate T cell immune responses. Antibodies induced by MAV/06 vaccination showed immunogenicity against a variety of varicella-zoster virus and cross-reactivity among the virus clades.
CONCLUSIONS: It is indicating the similarity of the antibody responses induced by commercial varicella vaccines and the MAV/06 vaccine. Moreover, VZV-specific T cell immune response from MAV/06 vaccination was increased via Th1 cell response. MAV/06 varicella vaccine induced both humoral and cellular immune response via Th1 cell mediated response.","['Shin D', 'Shin Y', 'Kim E', 'Nam H', 'Nan H', 'Lee J']",2022,23,1,BMC Immunol,"Shin D, et al.

35633236,An Outbreak Investigation of Varicella Zoster among Male Military Personnel in a Military Training Centre.,"INTRODUCTION: Chickenpox is an acute, highly infectious disease. Outbreaks can occur in adults in closed institutional settings like hostels and barracks. This study aims to report varicella zoster outbreak among male military personnel in a military training centre.
METHODS: An outbreak investigation of chickenpox in a military training school and tertiary hospital was conducted. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number: 267). Data was collected from February 5, 2020 to April 10, 2020 by questionnaire and clinical examination. Case definitions were prepared as per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Data was entered and analysed in Microsoft Excel 2010.
RESULTS: Out of the 167 male personnel in the training centre, 90 (53.89%) were susceptible to varicella and 84 (50.29%) were close contacts. The secondary attack rate of varicella zoster was 21.43% (18 cases). The mean age of the patients was 22.33±1.72 years. The mean days of admission were 5±2.28 days. The most common clinical features were generalised rash in 18 (100%), fever in 15 (83.33%), and body ache in 12 (66.67%) cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Natural history, clinical, and epidemiological features of varicella zoster in a closed institutional setting was studied with the secondary attack rate being less as compared to other studies.

35632698,Can Individuals with Suboptimal Antibody Responses to Conventional Antiviral Vaccines Acquire Adequate Antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination?,"In Japan, healthcare workers (HCWs) are vaccinated against measles, rubella, chickenpox, mumps, and hepatitis B to prevent nosocomial infection; however, some do not produce sufficient antibodies (""suboptimal responders""). This study compared immune responses to a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 mRNA) vaccine among HCWs with normal and suboptimal responses to conventional vaccines. In this prospective cohort study, 50 HCWs received two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 3 weeks apart. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibodies were measured 11 times, starting before the first vaccination and ending 5 months after the second vaccination. Antibody titers of four suboptimal and 46 normal responders were compared. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity was measured twice in suboptimal responders, 1 week/1 month and 5 months after the second vaccination. The SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody was detectable in the samples from suboptimal and normal responders at each timepoint after vaccination. Suboptimal responders exhibited SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity 1 week/1 month as well as 5 months after the second vaccination; however, activity was slightly reduced at 5 months. Our findings show that suboptimal responders do acquire adequate SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from vaccination to prevent SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines should thus be recommended for both normal and suboptimal responders to conventional vaccines.","['Ogura W', 'Ohtsuka K', 'Matsuura S', 'Okuyama T', 'Matsushima S', 'Yamasaki S', 'Miyagi H', 'Sekiguchi K', 'Ohnishi H', 'Watanabe T']",2022,14,5,Viruses,"Ogura W, et al.

35632603,Fraternal Twins: The Enigmatic Role of the Immune System in Alphaherpesvirus Pathogenesis and Latency and Its Impacts on Vaccine Efficacy.,"Although the establishment, maintenance and reactivation from alphaherpesvirus latency is far from fully understood, some things are now manifestly clear: Alphaherpesvirus latency occurs in neurons of the peripheral nervous system and control of the process is multifactorial and complex. This includes components of the immune system, contributions from non-neuronal cells surrounding neurons in ganglia, specialized nucleic acids and modifications to the viral DNA to name some of the most important. Efficacious vaccines have been developed to control both acute varicella and zoster, the outcome of reactivation, but despite considerable effort vaccines for acute herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or reactivated lesions have thus far failed to materialize despite considerable effort. Given the relevance of the immune system to establish and maintain HSV latency, a vaccine designed to tailor the HSV response to maximize the activity of components most critical for controlling reactivated infection might limit the severity of recurrences and hence reduce viral transmission. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of immunological factors that contribute to HSV and VZV latency, identify differences between varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV that could explain why vaccines have been valuable at controlling VZV disease but not HSV, and finish by outlining possible strategies for developing effective HSV vaccines.","['Rouse BT', 'Schmid DS']",2022,14,5,Viruses,Rouse BT and Schmid DS.

35627495,A Deep Learning Approach to Estimate the Incidence of Infectious Disease Cases for Routinely Collected Ambulatory Records: The Example of Varicella-Zoster.,"The burden of infectious diseases is crucial for both epidemiological surveillance and prompt public health response. A variety of data, including textual sources, can be fruitfully exploited. Dealing with unstructured data necessitates the use of methods for automatic data-driven variable construction and machine learning techniques (MLT) show promising results. In this framework, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection was chosen to perform an automatic case identification with MLT. Pedianet, an Italian pediatric primary care database, was used to train a series of models to identify whether a child was diagnosed with VZV infection between 2004 and 2014 in the Veneto region, starting from free text fields. Given the nature of the task, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) was chosen; the same models were then used to predict the children's status for the following years. A gold standard produced by manual extraction for the same interval was available for comparison. RNN-GRU improved its performance over time, reaching the maximum value of area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of 95.30% at the end of the period. The absolute bias in estimates of VZV infection was below 1.5% in the last five years analyzed. The findings in this study could assist the large-scale use of EHRs for clinical outcome predictive modeling and help establish high-performance systems in other medical domains.","['Lanera C', 'Baldi I', 'Francavilla A', 'Barbieri E', 'Tramontan L', 'Scamarcia A', 'Cantarutti L', 'Giaquinto C', 'Gregori D']",2022,19,10,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Lanera C, et al.

However, there are very few reports that has linked a varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. In this report, we describe a case of a 57-year-old man presented with atypical clinical presentation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with gait ataxia, complete ophtalmoplegia, and abolished reflexes followed by drowsiness and confusion. Initial diagnosis of Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis was suspected. Few days later, the patient developed herpes zoster in a localized right T1-T2 dermatome. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV was negative. CSF anti-NMDA antibodies were proved positive. A diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with concomitant VZV skin reactivation was retained. Favorable outcome with combined antiviral treatment and immunomodulatory therapy was observed. Concomitant VZV reactivation with autoimmune encephalitis is possible. Prognosis and therapeutic options in this rare condition remain to be clarified.","['Fatma N', 'Zakaria S', 'Mourad Z', 'Samir B', 'Samia BS']",2022,28,3,J Neurovirol,"Fatma N, et al.

In this study, we investigated the impact of PHSMs for COVID-19, with a particular focus on varicella dynamics in Japan. We adopted the susceptible-infectious-recovered type of mathematical model to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of varicella from Jan. 2010 to Sep. 2021. We analyzed epidemiological and demographic data and estimated the within-year and multi-year component of the force of infection and the biases associated with reporting and ascertainment in three periods: pre-vaccination (Jan. 2010-Dec. 2014), pre-pandemic vaccination (Jan. 2015-Mar. 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Apr. 2020-Sep. 2021). By using the estimated parameter values, we reconstructed and predicted the varicella dynamics from 2010 to 2027. Although the varicella incidence dropped drastically during the COVID-19 pandemic, the change in susceptible dynamics was minimal; the number of susceptible individuals was almost stable. Our prediction showed that the risk of a major outbreak in the post-pandemic era may be relatively small. However, uncertainties, including age-related susceptibility and travel-related cases, exist and careful monitoring would be required to prepare for future varicella outbreaks.","['Suzuki A', 'Nishiura H']",2022,19,6,Math Biosci Eng,"Suzuki A and Nishiura H.

35591751,"Effect of COVID-19 restrictions and border closures on vaccine preventable diseases in Victoria, Australia, 2020-2021.","BACKGROUND: In 2020, Victoria introduced multiple interventions aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We examine the effect of these restrictions on other vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs).
METHODS: We analysed the mandatory reporting data, notified to the Victorian Department of Health, for VPDs from January 2015 to December 2021.
RESULTS: Reductions in notifications were seen for most notifiable VPDs. A precipitous decline in influenza and measles notifications was recorded in April 2020, which was sustained for both diseases throughout 2020-2021. Notifications for chickenpox, invasive meningococcal disease, invasive pneumococcal disease, and pertussis were reduced by greater than 50% from the 2015-2019 average. No notified cases of diphtheria, poliomyelitis, or rubella were reported in 2020-2021.
CONCLUSION: Restrictions placed to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with significant reductions in other VPDs, which were sustained into 2021. Nevertheless, it is important that high levels of population vaccine coverage continue, to prevent a rebound increase in VPDs as restrictions are eased, and to maximise protection against VPDs for all Australians.","['Bhatt P', 'Strachan J', 'Easton M', 'Franklin L', 'Drewett G']",2022,46,,Commun Dis Intell (2018),"Bhatt P, et al.

35582739,Low post-transplant measles and varicella titers among pediatric liver transplant recipients: A 10-year single-center study.,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine preventable illnesses are important sources of morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare costs in pediatric LT recipients. Our aim was to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies to measles and VZV in this population.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 44 patients who received LT before age 18 at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital from January 2008 to December 2017.
RESULTS: Median age at transplantation was 2.5 years (IQR 1.2-7.7). Post-transplant measles antibodies were present in 17 of 37 patients (46%); risk factors for seronegativity included younger age at transplant (p = .02) and greater time from transplant to testing (p = .04). Post-transplant VZV antibodies were present in 17 of 39 patients (44%); risk factors for seronegativity included greater time from transplant to testing (p = .04). 6 of 16 patients (38%) who tested positive for pre-transplant VZV antibodies tested negative after transplantation. Fourteen of 20 patients (70%) with at least 1 documented dose of the MMR vaccine tested positive for post-transplant measles antibodies. Ten of 20 of patients (50%) with at least 1 documented dose of the VZV vaccine tested positive for post-transplant VZV antibodies. We also describe 10 patients who received post-transplant measles and VZV vaccines without documented complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pediatric LT patients are at greater risk of contracting measles and VZV despite vaccination status, and that prevalence of measles and VZV antibodies decreases as time from transplantation increases. This should weigh into the institutional risk-benefit assessment when deciding whether or not to administer LAVs to these patients.","['Liman AYJ', 'Wozniak LJ', 'de St Maurice A', 'Dunkel GL', 'Wanlass EM', 'Venick RS', 'McDiarmid SV']",2022,26,6,Pediatr Transplant,"Liman AYJ, et al.

35572642,Development of an Indirect ELISA Kit for Rapid Detection of Varicella-Zoster Virus Antibody by Glycoprotein E.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a highly infectious agent that causes varicella (chickenpox), can also cause zoster (shingles), a disorder that is frequently associated with severe neuralgia. A reliable serological VZV diagnostic assay would be useful for identifying unprotected individuals and for surveilling post-vaccination immunoprotection status. Toward this goal, VZV membrane glycoprotein E (gE), the immunodominant VZV protein, served as target antigen in an indirect ELISA kit developed here to detect anti-VZV antibodies in clinical samples. For target antigen preparation, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were modified to express and secrete the VZV gE ectodomain, which was subsequently purified and used as coating antigen in an indirect ELISA. Ultimately, the optimal purified gE coating antigen concentration was determined to be 2 μg.ml","['Niu Y', 'Wang A', 'Zhou J', 'Liu H', 'Chen Y', 'Ding P', 'Qi Y', 'Liang C', 'Zhu X', 'Zhang G']",2022,13,,Front Microbiol,"Niu Y, et al.

35570078,"Catch-up vaccination campaign in children between 6 and 8 years old during COVID-19 pandemic: The experience in a COVID hub in Milan, Italy.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has led to disruption in routine immunization programs around the world. Effective strategies need to be developed to address the decline in vaccine coverage to avoid preventable disease outbreaks. Our study reports a 4-days campaign for the catching-up of missed vaccinations in children aged between 6 and 8 years, in Milan, Italy.
METHODS: The catch-up vaccination campaign (21st-24th of September 2021) involved children born in 2013, 2014 and 2015. These cohorts, if not already immunized, received the fourth dose of the Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis and Poliomyelitis vaccination (DTaPP4), the second dose of the Measles-Mumps and Rubella vaccination (MMR2) and Chickenpox, according to the Italian vaccine schedule.
RESULTS: 3,943 letters were sent to children with a missing vaccination. 1,315 children, 33% of expected, were vaccinated during the campaign. The 2015 cohort was the one that benefited most from the initiative, 955 children were vaccinated for a total of 1,864 doses administered. This has led to a significant increase of 20.0 percentage points (p.p.) in vaccination coverages for the fourth dose of DTaPP and the second dose of MMR. 214 children for the 2014 cohort and 146 for the 2013 cohort were vaccinated during the following days, these cohorts have been already called previously therefore the participation in the campaign and consequently the increase in vaccination coverages were less substantial.
CONCLUSIONS: This experience has demonstrated that a mass vaccination campaign could be a useful tool in catch-up strategies, even during the pandemic. It should be part of a bigger immunization program strategy that also includes efforts to simultaneously strengthen routine immunization services. With the appropriate organizational improvements, this initiative could pave the way for future successful campaigns involving different age groups and vaccinations.","['Mancarella M', 'Natarelli F', 'Bertolini C', 'Zagari A', 'Enrica Bettinelli M', 'Castaldi S']",2022,40,26,Vaccine,"Mancarella M, et al.

35544890,Post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke in children and neurocognitive performance: a 4-year follow-up study.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze data from children who were previously healthy and presented with post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke upon arrival when admitted to the emergency room, with focus on the clinical/laboratory aspects, and neurocognitive performance after four-year follow-up.
METHODS: Seven children presenting with arterial ischemic stroke after varicella were evaluated at pediatric emergency services in the city of São Paulo (SP), Brazil. Ischemic stroke was determined by magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography in a topography compatible with the areas supplied by the middle cerebral or internal carotid arteries. IgG-class antibodies against varicella zoster virus and varicella-zoster virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in cerebrospinal fluid were tested. Patients with prothrombotic conditions were excluded. The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure was applied upon admission and 4-years after the stroke.
RESULTS: All patients (age range: 1.3 to 4 years) included presented chickenpox 5.1 (±3.5) months before. All patients had analysis of anti-varicella-zoster-virus-IgG in cerebrospinal fluid, but only three (43%) had a positive result. Of the patients 43% had no vascular lesions identified in magnetic resonance angiography. All patients showed improvement in their sequela scores. After 4 years, five patients displayed good evolution in the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure, and only one patient presented with a score of 2 in the sensorimotor and cognition areas. No recurrence of arterial ischemic stroke was observed.
CONCLUSION: We reinforced the non-progressive course of post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke after 4-year follow-up. The presence of varicella-zoster-virus-DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction, and/or intrathecal IgG antibody against varicella zoster virus, and angiopathy location in magnetic resonance angiography were not determining for the diagnosis. Invasive tests, with low sensitivity, should be well considered in the diagnosis of post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke.","['Rodrigues RM', 'Farhat SCL', 'Lucato LT', 'Sakano TMS', 'Plaggert PSG', 'Casella EB', 'Paz JAD', 'Schvartsman C']",2022,20,,Einstein (Sao Paulo),"Rodrigues RM, et al.

METHODS: An ecological, time-series study that considered data from 853 municipalities in the state of Minas Gerais that compose the 14 regions of the state, these being the territorial units of analysis. Records of applied doses of hepatitis A, measles, mumps and rubella, and varicella vaccines registered in the Brazilian Immunization Information System were analyzed. Trends were estimated by Prais-Winsten regression and 95% confidence intervals of measures of variation were calculated.
RESULTS: Low vaccine coverage of hepatitis A, measles, mumps and rubella, and varicella was identified. Coverages above 95% were observed only in 2015 for the vaccine against hepatitis A (98.8%) and, in 2016, for varicella (98.4%). The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine showed coverage of less than 95% in all analyzed years. Decreases of 13.6 and 4.3% between the years 2019 and 2020 were identified for the measles, mumps and rubella, and hepatitis A vaccines, respectively. There was a decreasing trend in hepatitis A vaccination coverage in the South (p=0.041), East (p=0.030), and North (p=0.045) regions; and for the measles, mumps and rubella in Jequitinhonha Valley (p=0.002), East (p=0.004), and North (p=0.024) regions. Increasing coverage was observed only for varicella in eight regions of the state.
CONCLUSIONS: The data point to heterogeneity in the temporal behavior of vaccination coverage in Minas Gerais. The downward trend in some regions causes concern about the possibility of resurgence of diseases, such as measles, which until then had been controlled.","['Oliveira GCCF', 'Rodrigues RN', 'Silva MCD', 'Nascimento GLMD', 'Lanza FM', 'Gusmão JD', 'Oliveira VC', 'Guimarães EAA']",2022,25,,Rev Bras Epidemiol,"Oliveira GCCF, et al.

In Chile, sentinel surveillance is carried out only on an outpatient basis, without knowing the impact of varicella in serious cases who need to be hospitalized.
AIM: To describe the clinical characteristics and the costs associated with hospitalized children with diagnosis of varicella prior to the vaccine introduction in the National Immunization Program in Chile.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter, observational, and retrospective study in hospitalized children (0-15 years) with a diagnosis of varicella, were conducted in five hospitals in Chile between January 2011 and December 2015. A review of the clinical records was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the disease and costs associated with hospitalization episodes for varicella.
RESULTS: A total of 685 hospitalized children for varicella were included in this study. The median age was 3 years (IQR: 1-5), most children were between 1 and 4 years of age (52% of total cases). 56% were male, and only 7 patients (1%) had a history of previous varicella vaccination. The median lenght of days of hospitalization was 3 days (IQR: 2-5). 13% of the cases required hospitalization in a more complex care unit, 6% in the intermediate unit and 7% in the pediatric intensive treatment unit, both with a median stay of 3 days. The main complications were: skin and soft tissue infections (42%), neurologic (8%) and septic or toxic shock (4%). There were 3 cases of death (0.4%). The direct cost of a varicella case was US $ 417, the indirect cost was US $ 224 and the proportional cost of a case of death was US $ 3,575. It is estimated that the total cost of a hospitalized varicella case in Chile was US $ 4,216.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella is associated with a significant burden of disease in Chile. The median hospital stay was three days with 13% of cases requiring medical care in a complex unit, with high associated costs which could be significantly reduced with the recently incorporation of the varicella vaccine into the National Immunization Program.","['Torres JP', 'Maza V', 'Izquierdo G', 'Contardo V', 'Conca N', 'Ducasse K', 'Castro M']",2021,38,5,Rev Chilena Infectol,"Torres JP, et al.

35474287,[A 73-year-old man with polyradiculopathy and multiple cranial neuropathies emerging separate from the originating dermatome of a varicella zoster skin lesion].,"A 73-year-old man developed delayed-onset multiple cranial neuropathies of cranial nerves V, VII and VIII, and segmental paresis in the ipsilateral upper extremity related to the C4 to Th1 segment, after all skin lesions with varicella zoster (VZV) on the left neck of the C3-4 dermatome had dried and crusted over. On admission, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed pleocytosis (all mononuclear cells, 12/μl). Treatment was started with intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg, every 8 h for 14 days) and methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day for 3 days). Four days after starting treatment, left segmental paresis was improved, but the multiple cranial neuropathies persisted. Oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) was administered for 5 days, then tapered off. All neurological symptoms had disappeared by hospital day 23. Of particular interest was the discrepancy between skin regions affected by VZV (C3-4) and the regions of cranial neuropathy (cranial nerves V, VII, and VIII) and muscle weakness innervated by C4-Th1. Although CSF was negative for VZV DNA according to PCR testing, the antibody index for VZV was elevated. This suggests intrathecal synthesis of VZV antibodies and supports the diagnosis of VZV meningitis. Also, all cranial nerves involved in this case were reported to have the cranial nerve ganglia where VZV could have established latency and been reactivated. This suggests concurrent reactivation on each cranial nerve ganglia without cutaneous lesions, as zoster sine herpete. In addition, anastomoses among the upper cervical nerves, which are found in some patients, may have contributed to this condition. These mechanisms underlie various neurological symptoms associated with VZV infection.","['Motohashi S', 'Takahashi J', 'Umehara T', 'Komatsu T', 'Murakami H', 'Iguchi Y']",2022,62,5,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Motohashi S, et al.

An outbreak of varicella among healthcare workers in a tertiary care centre was investigated, and preventive measures were implemented.
METHODS: Cases of chicken pox between 05 Feb 2017 and 11 Feb 2017 in a tertiary healthcare establishment were investigated. An epidemiological investigation by developing case definitions, spot map and contact tracing was conducted. Eight cases were identified among healthcare workers. Suitable preventive measures including identification of susceptible contacts and vaccination of susceptible ones with two doses of varicella vaccine was undertaken.
RESULTS: Index case was a 21-year-old nurse who was exposed to a 34-year-old male patient transferred from a secondary care hospital on 24 Jan 2017 as a case of acute liver failure and coagulopathy. Primary case was later diagnosed as case of varicella based on serological and clinical evidence. Among a total of 8 cases identified in the outbreak, the cases occurred among healthcare workers of secondary care centre, healthcare workers managing the primary case in the intensive care unit and who conducted the autopsy. A total of 181 contacts were identified in the epidemiological investigation, and 54 were susceptible to chicken pox. Two-dose immunization with varicella vaccination of susceptible ones was found to be effective in preventing further cases.

35462584,Herpes zoster preceding neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: casual or causal relationship? A systematic literature review.,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a severe, inflammatory, immune-mediated astrocytopathy of the central nervous system, characterized by recurrent inflammatory events primarily involving optic nerves and the spinal cord. Recently, a triggering role of infectious events in the development of NMOSD has been suggested. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the agent most involved, although the linkage with anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies is so far unknown. A review of the literature on the association between NMOSD and VZV infection was carried out by searching PUBMED and EMBASE from 1975 to July 2020. A total of 13 articles concerning Herpes zoster preceding NMOSD were identified. All patients were female and the median age at NMOSD presentation was 28.5 (range 5-63) years. Four NMOSD cases occurred after chicken pox while the remaining ten after HZ. Full recovery occurred in 5/14 patients. From the review of the literature, we can infer that VZV seems to trigger LETM attacks and not the disease itself. The strict temporal relationship between VZV infection and NMOSD seems to exceed the pure chance and represents an unusual clinical scenario posing several diagnostic and management challenges.","['Turco EC', 'Curti E', 'Pisani F', 'Granella F']",2022,28,2,J Neurovirol,"Turco EC, et al.

35458556,"Development of Robust Varicella Zoster Virus Luciferase Reporter Viruses for In Vivo Monitoring of Virus Growth and Its Antiviral Inhibition in Culture, Skin, and Humanized Mice.","There is a continued need to understand varicella-zoster virus (VZV) pathogenesis and to develop more effective antivirals, as it causes chickenpox and zoster. As a human-restricted alphaherpesvirus, the use of human skin in culture and mice is critical in order to reveal the important VZV genes that are required for pathogenesis but that are not necessarily observed in the cell culture. We previously used VZV-expressing firefly luciferase (fLuc), under the control of the constitutively active SV40 promoter (VZV-BAC-Luc), to measure the VZV spread in the same sample. However, the fLuc expression was independent of viral gene expression and viral DNA replication programs. Here, we developed robust reporter VZV viruses by using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technology, expressing luciferase from VZV-specific promoters. We also identified two spurious mutations in VZV-BAC that were corrected for maximum pathogenesis. VZV with fLuc driven by ORF57 showed superior growth in cells, human skin explants, and skin xenografts in mice. The ORF57-driven luciferase activity had a short half-life in the presence of foscarnet. This background was then used to investigate the roles for ORF36 (thymidine kinase (TK)) and ORF13 (thymidylate synthase (TS)) in skin. The studies reveal that VZV-∆TS had increased sensitivity to brivudine and was highly impaired for skin replication.

35437206,Immunogenicity of varicella-zoster virus vaccine by different routes of administration: Comparable vaccination efficacy of one-fifth dose intradermal vaccination to conventional subcutaneous vaccination.,"BACKGROUND: The live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine is used for the prevention of chickenpox and herpes zoster; however, there have been few studies on the immunogenicity of intradermal vaccination.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the immunogenicity between subcutaneous and intradermal VZV vaccination.
METHODS: Thirty healthy participants aged 50-75 who developed erythema less than 10 mm in diameter in VZV skin test were examined. Thirteen participants received full dose of VZV vaccine subcutaneously and 17 participants received one-fifth dose of vaccine intradermally. Immunogenicity to VZV was determined by VZV skin test reaction, proliferation of VZV-specific memory T cells, levels of VZV-specific serum antibody, and cytokine production from peripheral blood cells.
RESULTS: VZV skin test reaction was similar between two groups. VZV-specific memory T cells were significantly increased only in the intradermal injection group. The increase of VZV-specific memory T cells correlated with Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. No serious adverse events were observed in either group after vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Intradermal injection with one-fifth dose VZV vaccine showed a similar or greater effect on VZV-specific cellular immunostimulation than conventional subcutaneous injection. These findings suggest that one-fifth dose intradermal vaccination may have a comparable preventive effect to conventional subcutaneous injection.","['Nakamura-Nishimura Y', 'Shinkuma S', 'Miyagawa F', 'Haredy A', 'Gomi Y', 'Yamanishi K', 'Asada H']",2022,106,2,J Dermatol Sci,"Nakamura-Nishimura Y, et al.

35432330,Early-Life Antibiotic Exposure Associated With Varicella Occurrence and Breakthrough Infections: Evidence From Nationwide Pre-Vaccination and Post-Vaccination Cohorts.,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-driven dysbiosis may impair immune function and reduce vaccine-induced antibody titers.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the impacts of early-life antibiotic exposure on subsequent varicella and breakthrough infections.
METHODS: This is a nationwide matched cohort study. From Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we initially enrolled 187,921 children born from 1997 to 2010. Since 2003, the Taiwan government has implemented a one-dose universal varicella vaccination program for children aged 1 year. We identified 82,716 children born during the period 1997 to 2003 (pre-vaccination era) and 48,254 children born from July 1, 2004, to 2009 (vaccination era). In the pre-vaccination era, 4,246 children exposed to antibiotics for at least 7 days within the first 2 years of life (Unvaccinated A-cohort) were compared with reference children not exposed to antibiotics (Unvaccinated R-cohort), with 1:1 matching for gender, propensity score, and non-antibiotic microbiota-altering medications. Using the same process, 9,531 children in the Vaccinated A-cohort and Vaccinated R-cohort were enrolled from the vaccination era and compared. The primary outcome was varicella. In each era, demographic characteristics were compared, and cumulative incidences of varicella were calculated. Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine associations.
RESULTS: In the pre-vaccination era, the 5-year cumulative incidence of varicella in the Unvaccinated A-cohort (23.45%, 95% CI 22.20% to 24.70%) was significantly higher than in the Unvaccinated R-cohort (16.72%, 95% CI 15.62% to 17.82%) (p<.001). In the vaccination era, a significantly higher 5-year cumulative incidence of varicella was observed in the Vaccinated A-cohort (1.63%, 95% 1.32% to 1.93%) than in the Vaccinated R-cohort (1.19%, 95% CI 0.90% to 0.45%) (p=0.006). On multivariate analyses, early-life antibiotic exposure was an independent risk factor for varicella occurrence in the pre-vaccination (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.12) and vaccination eras (aHR 1.66, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.23). The use of penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, or sulfonamides in infancy was all positively associated with childhood varicella regardless of vaccine administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic exposure in early life is associated with varicella occurrence and breakthrough infections.","['Lin TL', 'Fan YH', 'Chang YL', 'Ho HJ', 'Liang LL', 'Chen YJ', 'Wu CY']",2022,13,,Front Immunol,"Lin TL, et al.

Like all herpes viruses, after primary infection it enters into latency and can be reactivated afterwards. Many forms of symptomatic reactivation of VZV exist including acute retinal necrosis (ARN), an ophthalmic emergency which can lead to blindness. ARN is treated starting with high-dose intravenous acyclovir then with oral valaciclovir for a total duration of up to 3 months. Symptomatic reactivations of VZV are public health issues.

Here we described a case of bilateral cystoid macular edema (CME) and endothelial rejection in a DSAEK patient following influenza and varicella vaccines.
CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old woman with bilateral Fuch's endothelial dystrophy received bilateral DSAEK surgeries. She received an influenza vaccination and her left visual acuity (VA) decreased due to CME. Half a year later, the patient received a varicella-zoster virus vaccine. 11 days later, she was found to have signs of endothelial graft rejection in both eyes. Unfortunately, her vision further deteriorated despite intensive topical steroid treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In view of the current worldwide efforts on mass vaccination against the COVID-19 pandemic, we suggest an increased use of topical corticosteroids both before and after vaccination may be helpful in reducing this risk.","['Ho DK', 'Stevenson SR', 'Kumar V']",2023,31,3,Ocul Immunol Inflamm,"Ho DK, et al.

35392857,Epidemiological analysis of varicella in Dalian from 2009 to 2019 and application of three kinds of model in prediction prevalence of varicella.,"OBJECTIVE: This study described the epidemic characteristics of varicella in Dalian from 2009 to 2019, explored the fitting effect of Grey model first-order one variable( GM(1,1)), Markov model, and GM(1,1)-Markov model on varicella data, and found the best fitting method for this type of data, to better predict the incidence trend.
METHODS: For this Cross-sectional study, this article was completed in 2020, and the data collection is up to 2019. Due to the global epidemic, the infectious disease data of Dalian in 2020 itself does not conform to the normal changes of varicella and is not included. The epidemiological characteristics of varicella from 2009 to 2019 were analyzed by epidemiological descriptive methods. Using the varicella prevalence data from 2009 to 2018, predicted 2019 and compared with actual value. First made GM (1,1) prediction and Markov prediction. Then according to the relative error of the GM (1,1), made GM (1,1)-Markov prediction.
RESULTS: This study collected 37,223 cases from China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention's ""Disease Prevention and Control Information System"" and the cumulative population was 73,618,235 from 2009 to 2019. The average annual prevalence was 50.56/100000. Varicella occurred all year round, it had a bimodal distribution. The number of cases had two peaks from April to June and November to January of the following year. The ratio of males to females was 1.17:1. The 4 to 25 accounted for 60.36% of the total population. The age of varicella appeared to shift backward. Students, kindergarten children, scattered children accounted for about 64% of all cases. The GM(1,1) model prediction result of 2019 would be 53.64, the relative error would be 14.42%, the Markov prediction result would be 56.21, the relative error would be 10.33%, and the Gray(1,1)-Markov prediction result would be 59.51. The relative error would be 5.06%.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella data had its unique development characteristics. The accuracy of GM (1,1)-Markov model is higher than GM(1.1) model and Markov model. The model can be used for prediction and decision guidance.","['Cheng T', 'Bai Y', 'Sun X', 'Ji Y', 'Zhang F', 'Li X']",2022,22,1,BMC Public Health,"Cheng T, et al.

35382665,Vaccination coverage rates and attitudes towards mandatory vaccinations among healthcare personnel in tertiary-care hospitals in Greece.,"OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to estimate vaccination and susceptibility rates against vaccine-preventable diseases among healthcare personnel (HCP) in eight hospitals.
METHODS: Cross-sectional survey.
RESULTS: A total of 1284 HCP participated (physicians: 31.3%, nursing personnel: 36.6%, paramedical personnel: 11.1%, administrative personnel: 13.2%, supportive personnel: 7.3%). Vaccination rates were 32.9% against measles and mumps, 38.1% against rubella, 5.7% against varicella, 9.2% against hepatitis A, 65.8% against hepatitis B, 31.8% against tetanus-diphtheria, 7.1% against pertussis, 60.2% against influenza, and 80.1% against COVID-19. Susceptibility rates were as follows: 27.8% for measles, 39.6% for mumps, 33.4% for rubella, 22.2% for varicella, 86.3% for hepatitis A, 34.2% for hepatitis B, 68.2% for tetanus-diphtheria, and 92.9% for pertussis. Older HCP had higher susceptibility rates against mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tetanus-diphtheria, and pertussis (p-values <0.001 for all). Mandatory vaccinations were supported by 81.85% of HCP.
CONCLUSIONS: Although most HCPs supported mandatory vaccinations, significant vaccination gaps, and susceptibility rates were recorded. The proportion of susceptible HCP to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella has increased in the past decade, mostly because of reduction in acquired cases of natural illness. Vaccination programs for HCP should be developed. A national registry to follow HCP's vaccination rates is urgently needed.","['Maltezou HC', 'Tseroni M', 'Drositis I', 'Gamaletsou MN', 'Koukou DM', 'Bolikas E', 'Peskelidou E', 'Daflos C', 'Panagiotaki E', 'Ledda C', 'Pavli A', 'Moussas N', 'Kontogianni S', 'Svarna E', 'Ploumidis M', 'Spyrou A', 'Chini M', 'Adamis G', 'Lourida A', 'Hatzigeorgiou D', 'Gargalianos P', 'Syrogiannopoulos G', 'Sipsas NV']",2022,21,6,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Maltezou HC, et al.

35336994,Effect of Routine Varicella Immunization on the Epidemiology and Immunogenicity of Varicella and Shingles.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella as a primary infection and remains latent in the ganglia until it becomes reactivated to cause herpes zoster. Individuals with varicella develop adaptive humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Compromised cell-mediated immunity is thought to contribute to the development of herpes zoster. Recent evidence suggests that changes in the epidemiology of varicella have affected the epidemiology of herpes zoster. The incidence of herpes zoster is higher in older adults; thus, the herpes zoster vaccine is recommended for older adults. However, the incidence of herpes zoster is expected to rise among younger individuals; hence, vaccination with the varicella vaccine should also be considered in younger adults. In order to determine the need for vaccination in different populations, it is important to establish methods to accurately assess the activity of cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity.","['Otani N', 'Shima M', 'Yamamoto T', 'Okuno T']",2022,14,3,Viruses,"Otani N, et al.

35324972,"The use of dried blood spot cards to assess serologic responses of individuals vaccinated against measles, hepatitis A, tetanus, influenza and varicella zoster.","Traditional blood sampling by venipuncture is cumbersome and relatively expensive. Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is desirable because of its ease of sample collection, transportation and storage. It has been used in clinical diagnosis but not been thoroughly studied for the potential use to assess the immune status of individuals following natural infection or preventive vaccination. The goal of this study was to compare DBS to traditional blood samplings in detection of antibodies in individuals vaccinated against measles, hepatitis A, tetanus, influenza and varicella zoster. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to test DBS eluates and serum samples for antibodies against measles, varicella, tetanus and hepatitis A. Sensitivities, specificities, and correlation coefficients were evaluated to compare optical density (OD) values of paired serum and DBS samples. The long-term stability of DBS samples at different temperatures was assessed using simulated immune measles blood. DBS OD was highly correlated with serum OD for antibodies to measles (r = 0.93), varicella (r = 0.82), and tetanus (r = 0.91). Sensitivities of DBS OD ranged from 86-99% and specificities ranged from 96-100% using cut-offs established by each assay. By contrast, the hepatitis A data showed a low sensitivity (31%) and weak correlation (r = 0.14) between DBS and serum samples. Antibody titers in serum samples for anti-influenza A (H1N1 and H3N1) failed to correlate in DBS eluates in HAI and MN assays. DBS samples were stable for 4 weeks when stored at room temperature and for 6 months at 4°C. DBS sampling was sensitive, specific, and highly correlated with traditional venipuncture sampling in detection of antibodies against measles, tetanus and varicella zoster, but not hepatitis A and influenza. Thus, the success of using DBS sampling to assess the antibody levels in immunized individuals may be dependent on the pathogens and the development of the assay used.","['Reinhardt B', 'Taylor R', 'Dawkins C', 'Banks T', 'Watson N', 'Sundaram A', 'Ewing D', 'Danko JR']",2022,17,3,PLoS One,"Reinhardt B, et al.

35321363,Varicella-Zoster Scar Treatments: A Tertiary Review.,"Chickenpox is a highly communicable disease caused by Varicella Zoster Virus. Varicella rash commonly evolves into permanent depressed scars, documented in up to 18% of post varicella patients, leaving life-long cosmetic issues for patients. Although there is a lot of reviews on depressed scars, the viral etiology and the unique scar morphology of post varicella scar discriminate it from other depressed scars. Therefore it is required to assess the efficacy of scar removal modalities on these scars, specifically. Yet, despite the prevalence, there is no comprehensive review on chickenpox scars' treatment, particularly. This review provides an overview and categorization of efficacy and adverse events of various methods used in the treatment of post varicella skin scars. A comprehensive literature search was performed on major databases, including all papers related to post varicella scar treatment until 2020. The results were categorized into topical treatment with tretinoin, systemic medical treatments with topiramate and isotretinoin, non-invasive procedures including chemical peelings, micro-needling and laser, invasive procedures including dermal grafting and subcision-suction method, and combination therapies. According to literature, chemical peeling with trichloroacetic acid was the most frequently used method in the treatment of chickenpox scar, revealing moderate to excellent response in patients. However, there is insufficient evidence to accurately compare the efficacy of other modalities on these scars specifically.","['Pour Mohammad A', 'Ghassemi M']",2021,35,,Med J Islam Repub Iran,Pour Mohammad A and Ghassemi M.

A review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 especially among healthcare workers (HCW) is thus required. The aim of our current study was to provide a comprehensive review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW through six case reports and a literature review. We conducted a literature search for cases reports, original and review articles using PubMed and the Google search engines. We included the written English studies that mentioned cutaneous symptoms during COVID-19 infection. In addition to the review, 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January 2021. In our review, we included 17 articles in addition to our six cases. The type of papers was case series and case reports in respectively 8 and 9 studies. Skin manifestations were reported in two studies including two HCW, in addition to our series of six HCW. Skin manifestations were chilblain-like lesions (44.5%), a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%), a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%), painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%), urticaria (2.8%), purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%), and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%). Of the 218 cases, 203 cases have reported the location of lesions. The very great majority of lesions were found on the trunk, hands, and feet. Fifty-one patients (23.4%) experienced lesions on the trunk. The time of onset of cutaneous lesions was variable. At the diagnosis or the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, 8.3% (18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. After the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis, 36.7% (80/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. Of the 197 cases with reported healing times, healing times were up to 24 days. COVID-19 has been associated with different cutaneous manifestations, likely of varying pathophysiology and severity, some preceding COVID-19 symptomatology and others occurring during active disease or later in the course. Thus, heightened awareness and timely recognition of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19.","['Imen Y', 'Mechergui N', 'Litaiem N', 'Youssef I', 'Gara S', 'Zeglaoui F', 'Rammeh S', 'Ladhari N']",2022,10,3,Clin Case Rep,"Imen Y, et al.

METHODS: The study included children born between 1995-2012, aged 4-7 years at vaccination, and members of six healthcare delivery systems within Vaccine Safety Datalink. We conducted self-controlled risk interval analyses comparing rates of outcomes in risk and control intervals within each group defined by ASD status, and then compared outcome rates between children with and without ASD, in risk and control intervals, by estimating difference-in-differences using logistic regressions.
RESULTS: The study included 14,947 children with ASD and 1,650,041 children without ASD. After measles- or pertussis-containing vaccination, there were no differences in association between children with and without ASD for fever (ratio of rate ratio for measles-containing vaccine = 1.07, 95% CI 0.58-1.96; for pertussis-containing vaccine = 1.16, 95% CI 0.63-2.15) or ED visits (ratio of rate ratio for measles-containing vaccine = 1.11, 95% CI 0.80-1.54; for pertussis-containing vaccine = 0.87, 95% CI 0.59-1.28). Febrile seizures were rare. Pertussis-containing vaccines were associated with small increased risk of febrile seizures in children without ASD.
CONCLUSION: Children with ASD were not at increased risk for fever or ED visits compared with children without ASD following measles- or pertussis-containing vaccines. These results may provide further reassurance that these vaccines are safe for all children, including those with ASD.","['Zerbo O', 'Modaressi S', 'Goddard K', 'Lewis E', 'Fireman B', 'Daley MF', 'Irving SA', 'Jackson LA', 'Donahue JG', 'Qian L', 'Getahun D', 'DeStefano F', 'McNeil MM', 'Klein NP']",2022,40,18,Vaccine,"Zerbo O, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The epizootic strain M-96 of the virus as well as its attenuated variants KM-40 and KM-70 obtained by sequential passivation were used in the study. Isolation of the pathogen from suspension of biopsy specimens was performed on cell culture and in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). All experiments were performed with the number of replications ensuring obtaining reliable results.
RESULTS: The CMLPV was isolated from the crusts and pox papules of the skin taken from sick camels (Camelus bactrianus) during an outbreak in various districts of the Mangistau region at the end of 2019. The signs of pathogen reproduction on chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) were observed from 3 passages. The obtained virus caused formation of pathological changes on the CAM in the form of elevated dot or solid white formations separated from the surrounding tissue, with hemorrhagic foci in the center. The reproductive properties of the isolate on sensitive biological systems were determined in comparison with the epizootic CMLPV strain M-96, isolated earlier in the territory of Kazakhstan during the outbreak 23-24 years ago, as well as its attenuated variants. The isolated virus was given the conventional name M-2020.
DISCUSSION: When studied in two sensitive cultivation systems (cell culture and ECEs), strain M-96 and its attenuated variants KM-40, KM-70, which were used in the experiments as a control, demonstrated high infectious activity with titer 4.75-6.75 lg TCID50/cm3, while for the examined isolate M-2020 of CMLPV had the significantly lower values (3.00-4.75 lg TCID50/cm3, p &gt; 0,05).","['Zhugunissov КD', 'Mambetaliyev МА', 'Azanbekova МА', 'Kenzhebaeva МК', 'Kilibayev SS', 'Tuyskanova MS', 'Dzhapasheva AS', 'Omurtay AD', 'Tabys ST']",2022,67,1,Vopr Virusol,"Zhugunissov КD, et al.

35285727,Multicenter Evaluation of the Simplexa VZV Direct Assay for Detection of Varicella-Zoster Virus in Cerebrospinal Fluid and Lesion-Swab Specimens.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiologic agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles) infections commonly involving skin, mucous membranes, and less frequently the central nervous system. Traditional methods for the laboratory diagnosis of these infections are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often insensitive. As such, these tests are being replaced by more sensitive and rapid molecular methods. This study evaluated the performance of two different molecular assays, the Simplexa VZV Direct and Simplexa VZV Swab Direct, to detect VZV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lesion-swab specimens, respectively. The Simplexa VZV Direct and Simplexa VZV Swab Direct assays were compared against individual composite reference methods that varied depending on the sample cohort examined. A total of 883 CSF and 452 cutaneous and mucocutaneous prospective, retrospective, and contrived specimens were evaluated in this multicenter study. The results of this study showed that the Simplexa assays demonstrated near perfect agreement (k = 0.98) compared to the composite reference methods for the detection of VZV in CSF and lesion swab specimens. A further comparison between the standard of care molecular assays employed at the site of specimen collection and the Simplexa assays demonstrated excellent agreement (k = 1.0). The Simplexa assays offer rapid and reliable alternatives for the detection of VZV in certain clinical specimens without the need for nucleic acid extraction.","['Pancholi P', 'Relich RF', 'Chandrasekaran S', 'Dunn JJ', 'Granato PA', 'Harrington AT', 'Hansen GT', 'Ledeboer NA', 'Li Q', 'Sims MD', 'Uphoff TS', 'Greene W', 'Young S', 'Dhiman N']",2022,60,4,J Clin Microbiol,"Pancholi P, et al.

35279390,Early experience with varicella vaccination in pediatric heart transplant recipients.,"International consensus guidelines to vaccinate children after solid organ transplant with the live-attenuated varicella (VZV) vaccine exclude pediatric heart transplant recipients due to insufficient evidence for safety, seroconversion rate, or adverse event profile. Caution is also recommended in the setting of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) immunosuppression. However, VZV infection in these patients can be serious or even fatal. We report our novel early experience with VZV vaccination in a cohort of 31 children following heart transplantation, 42% of who were on MMF. The early seroconversion rate was 16/17 (94%) with no major adverse events. Though a rash of some description was reported in 29%, spots were few and self-resolving in 1-3 days. Select pediatric heart transplant patients can be safely vaccinated with VZV vaccine with a high early seroconversion rate and a mild adverse event profile.","['Dipchand AI', 'Seifert-Hansen M']",2022,41,8,J Heart Lung Transplant,Dipchand AI and Seifert-Hansen M.

35258445,Cost effectiveness and budget impact of universal varicella vaccination in Russia.,"This economic evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of introducing a two-dose varicella vaccine in the Russian national immunization program. A static Markov model followed a simulated 2019 Russian cohort over its lifetime and compared outcomes and costs of three varicella vaccination strategies: strategy I (doses given at 12 and 15 months of age), strategy II (doses given at 1 year and 6 years of age), and a no vaccination scenario. Inputs on age-dependent clinical pathways, associated costs, and related health outcomes were collected from national sources and published literature. Results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the healthcare payer and societal perspective over the lifetime of the birth cohort and the budget impact over a 10 years' time horizon. Vaccination strategies I and II resulted in an ICER of approximately 1.7 million rubles per quality-adjusted life years gained from the healthcare payer perspective and were cost-saving from the societal perspective. From the healthcare payer perspective, the costs per varicella case averted were 5,989 and 7,140 rubles per case for strategies I and II, respectively. However, from the societal perspective, vaccination is a dominant strategy and the budget impact analysis shows significant healthcare savings over 10 years, with strategy I realizing savings of ~2 billion rubles more than strategy II. From a public health impact perspective, varicella vaccination of children at 12 and 15 months of age through the Russian NIP is expected to be cost-effective with an affordable budget impact compared to no vaccination.","['Marijam A', 'Safonova E', 'Scherbakov M', 'Shpeer E', 'Van Oorschot D', 'Rudakova A', 'Tatochenko V', 'Briko N']",2022,18,5,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Marijam A, et al.

However, because the individual lesions appeared as hyperkeratotic papules and were unresponsive to antiviral therapy, a skin biopsy was performed, which revealed hyperkeratosis, suprabasal acantholysis and dyskeratosis with corps ronds and grains, consistent with acantholytic dyskeratotic acanthoma. Since this entity has been associated with Darier disease, whole-transcriptome sequencing by RNA-Seq was performed on RNA isolated from a lesion and from adjacent normal appearing skin, and a recently developed bioinformatics pipeline that can identify both genomic sequence variants and the presence of any of 926 viruses was applied. Two pathogenic missense mutations in the ATP2A2 gene were identified in the lesional but not in normal appearing skin, and no evidence of Varicella-Zoster infection was obtained. These findings confirm the diagnosis of segmental Darier disease due to postzygotic mutations in the ATP2A2 gene, and attest to the power of a novel single-step application of RNA-Seq in providing correct diagnosis in this rare genodermatosis.","['Mohaghegh F', 'Youssefian L', 'Galehdari H', 'Tavakoli N', 'Vahidnezhad H', 'Uitto J']",2022,31,6,Exp Dermatol,"Mohaghegh F, et al.

35241009,Visceral disseminated varicella zoster infection: a rare cause of acute abdomen in a patient with well-controlled diabetes mellitus-a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Visceral disseminated varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections frequently affect immunocompromised patients. Diabetes mellitus has been associated with VZV infection, and most cases of disseminated infection involve patients with poorly controlled blood glucose levels. It initially presents as severe abdominal pain, which is evaluated as an acute abdomen, however, the cause is typically unidentified due to unremarkable computed tomography (CT) findings. We report a case of visceral disseminated VZV infection in a patient with well-controlled diabetes mellitus with fat stranding around the celiac and superior mesenteric artery on CT.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Japanese woman with well-controlled diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that gradually worsened. She had stable vital signs and skin rashes, suggestive of varicella. Abdominal CT showed fat stranding around the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. The patient tested positive for the VZV antigen and was diagnosed with a visceral disseminated VZV infection. Acyclovir was administered, and the patient was discharged on the 14th day.
CONCLUSIONS: Visceral disseminated VZV infection may affect patients with well-controlled diabetes mellitus and causes acute abdomen. Periarterial fat stranding on CT is associated with abdominal pain due to visceral disseminated VZV infection.","['Mizu D', 'Nishida H', 'Matsuoka Y', 'Ariyoshi K']",2022,22,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Mizu D, et al.

35232594,Second dose of measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV) and the risk of febrile convulsions.,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown an increased risk of febrile convulsions (FC) after first immunization with the quadrivalent measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV) compared to a first dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) only or in combination with separately administered varicella vaccine (MMR + V). Therefore, it is recommended to give MMR + V at first dose and MMRV or MMR + V at second dose. Little is known on the risk of FC after MMRV at second dose, especially whether the risk depends on age, sex, history of FC or type of first dose vaccine.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using claims data from the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research database (GePaRD) was performed in children born between January 1st, 2004 and October 31st, 2015 who received two doses of MMRV, MMR + V or MMR. Cases were defined as hospitalization with a diagnosis of FC without neurological conditions coded as main discharge diagnosis. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intevals (CIs) were calculated to compare the risk of FC. Stratified analyses were performed to examine potential effect modification by age, sex, history of FC or type of first dose vaccine.
RESULTS: In the first 30 days after second dose vaccination, 464 FCs were observed in a cohort of 528,639 children with a median age of 17 months. After adjustment for potential confounders, the adjusted OR for FC in the 30 days after vaccination was 1.25 (95% CI 0.67-2.30) for MMRV compared to MMR + V and 1.04 (0.82-1.32) for MMRV compared to MMR. History of FC was the most important risk factor with an OR of 36.26 (29.30-44.89). We found no effect modification by age, sex, history of FC, or type of first dose vaccine.
CONCLUSION: Use of MMRV at second dose is not associated with an increased risk of FC compared to MMR + V or MMR, irrespective of age, sex, history of FC, or type of first dose vaccine.","['Schäfer W', 'Reinders T', 'Schink T']",2022,40,14,Vaccine,"Schäfer W, et al.

We also estimated the lag-response curves for different temperatures and the exposure-response relationships for different lag days. The number of varicella cases was 10,296. Compared with the minimum-varicella temperature (25°C), we found the largest effect of temperature on varicella within 21 lag days was at 1°C (RR, 6.72; 95% CI, 2.90-15.57), and then the effect declined as the temperature increased. A similar trend of rising first and then falling was found in temperature-response curves for different lag days. A reverse U-shape lag pattern was found for different levels of temperatures.

35215786,Herpes zoster: A Review of Clinical Manifestations and Management.,"The Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) or human herpes virus 3 is a neurotropic human alpha herpes virus responsible for chickenpox/varicella and shingles/Herpes zoster (HZ). This review will focus on HZ. Since HZ is secondary to varicella, its incidence increases with age. In children and youngsters, HZ is rare and associated to metabolic and neoplastic disorders. In adults, advanced age, distress, other infections (such as AIDS or COVID-19), and immunosuppression are the most common risk factors. HZ reactivation has recently been observed after COVID-19 vaccination. The disease shows different clinical stages of variable clinical manifestations. Some of the manifestations bear a higher risk of complications. Among the possible complications, postherpetic neuralgia, a chronic pain disease, is one of the most frequent. HZ vasculitis is associated with morbidity and mortality. Renal and gastrointestinal complications have been reported. The cornerstone of treatment is early intervention with acyclovir or brivudine. Second-line treatments are available. Pain management is essential. For (secondary) prophylaxis, currently two HZV vaccines are available for healthy older adults, a live attenuated VZV vaccine and a recombinant adjuvanted VZV glycoprotein E subunit vaccine. The latter allows vaccination also in severely immunosuppressed patients. This review focuses on manifestations of HZ and its management. Although several articles have been published on HZ, the literature continues to evolve, especially in regard to patients with comorbidities and immunocompromised patients. VZV reactivation has also emerged as an important point of discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially after vaccination. The objective of this review is to discuss current updates related to clinical presentations, complications, and management of HZ.","['Patil A', 'Goldust M', 'Wollina U']",2022,14,2,Viruses,"Patil A, et al.

35154584,Infectious Agents and Stroke: A Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: A major cause of injury and the second cause of death worldwide is stroke. Among several infectious agents considered as the risk factor of stroke, some pathogens demonstrated stronger robust associations with stroke. Proposing an accurate correlation between infectious microorganisms and stroke provides valuable information for early intervention and control of the infections.
METHODS: In this study, we searched the literature using the Web of Science, PMC/Medline via PubMed, and Scopus databases up to July 2018 without time and language restrictions. After quality assessment, 16 articles were included in the study. The whole data extraction process was independently conducted by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Based on the results of the studies, viruses, such as Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1, 2 (HSV-1, 2), Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV or Chickenpox), and West Nile virus (WNV) seem to be common causes of ischemic stroke. Moreover, the association of other microbial categories, such as Streptococcus mutans (in bacteria), Toxocara spp. and Toxoplasma gondii (in parasites), and Rhizopus sp. (in fungi) with stroke was reported.

35152238,The Burden of Vaccine-preventable Diseases in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at an increased risk of infections, including vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). The aim of this study was to explore the inpatient prevalence of VPD in patients with IBD, as well as inpatient outcomes.
METHODS: Retrospective study using the 2013-2017 Nationwide Inpatient Sample databases. All patients 18 years of age or older with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and 10th Revisions , Clinical Modification (ICD-9/10 CM) codes for IBD were included, as well as patients with VPDs as a principal diagnostic code. The primary outcome was the occurrence and odds of VPD in patients with IBD compared with patients with no IBD. Secondary outcomes were inpatient mortality, morbidity, and economic burden compared with patients with IBD and non-vaccine-preventable infections (VPIs). Multivariate regression yielded adjusted odds ratios.
RESULTS: Of 1,622,245 (0.9%) patients with a diagnosis of IBD, 3560 (0.2%) had associated VPDs, while 131,150 patients had non-VPI (8.1%). The most common VPDs were influenza, herpes zoster (HZ), pneumococcal pneumonia, and varicella. Only HZ and varicella had increased odds of occurrence in patients with IBD of all ages. Patients with IBD 65 years of age or older had increased odds of VPD compared with patients under 65 years. Patients with IBD and associated VPD had higher odds of intensive care unit stay, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multiorgan failure compared with patients with IBD and non-VPI.
CONCLUSIONS: VPDs represent a clinically relevant cause of infectious disease-related hospital admissions in patients with IBD. Patients with IBD are at increased risk for hospitalization due to HZ and varicella. Those hospitalized for VPD have higher morbidity compared with patients with IBD and non-VPI. These findings echo the importance of instituting optimal immunization schedules in patients with IBD, particularly in patients 65 years or older.","['Kröner PT', 'Picco MF', 'Cangemi JR', 'Hayney MS', 'Farraye FA', 'Caldera F']",2022,56,9,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Kröner PT, et al.

35149692,Development of a skin- and neuro-attenuated live vaccine for varicella.,"Varicella caused by the primary infection of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) exerts a considerable disease burden globally. Current varicella vaccines consisting of the live-attenuated vOka strain of VZV are generally safe and effective. However, vOka retains full neurovirulence and can establish latency and reactivate to cause herpes zoster in vaccine recipients, raising safety concerns. Here, we rationally design a live-attenuated varicella vaccine candidate, v7D. This virus replicates like wild-type virus in MRC-5 fibroblasts and human PBMCs, the carrier for VZV dissemination, but is severely impaired for infection of human skin and neuronal cells. Meanwhile, v7D shows immunogenicity comparable to vOka both in vitro and in multiple small animal species. Finally, v7D is proven well-tolerated and immunogenic in nonhuman primates. Our preclinical data suggest that v7D is a promising candidate as a safer live varicella vaccine with reduced risk of vaccine-related complications, and could inform the design of other herpes virus vaccines.","['Wang W', 'Pan D', 'Fu W', 'Ye X', 'Han J', 'Yang L', 'Jia J', 'Liu J', 'Zhu R', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu C', 'Ye J', 'Selariu A', 'Que Y', 'Zhao Q', 'Wu T', 'Li Y', 'Zhang J', 'Cheng T', 'Zhu H', 'Xia N']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Wang W, et al.

Good visual outcome was achieved with combination therapy, including intravitreal foscarnet, oral valaciclovir and prednisolone, topical dexamethasone and atropine, and barrier retinal laser. Second dose of the vaccine is planned under cover of high-dose oral valaciclovir therapy.
CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the possible association between COVID-19 vaccination and potentially blinding VZV reactivation. Therefore, prompt ophthalmic assessment is recommended in patients with visual disturbance following COVID-19 vaccination.","['Lo T', 'Varma S', 'Shaw A', 'Michalova K']",2023,31,3,Ocul Immunol Inflamm,"Lo T, et al.

35127608,Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing vs. Traditional Microbiological Tests for Diagnosing Varicella-Zoster Virus Central Nervous System Infection.,"BACKGROUND: Unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) detects pathogens in a target-independent manner. It is not well-understood whether mNGS has comparable sensitivity to target-dependent nucleic acid test for pathogen identification.
METHODS: This study included 31 patients with chickenpox and neurological symptoms for screening of possible varicella-zoster virus (VZV) central nervous system (CNS) infection. Microbiological diagnosing of VZV cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection was performed on stored CSF samples using mNGS, quantitative and qualitative VZV-specific PCR assays, and VZV IgM antibodies test.
RESULTS: The median age was 30.0 [interquartile range (IQR), 24.3-33.3] years. 51.6% of the patients were men. About 80.6% of the patients had normal CSF white blood cell counts (≤ 5 × 10
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that CSF mNGS may have higher sensitivity for VZV detection than CSF VZV PCR and antibody tests, and has the advantage of identifying unexpected pathogens.","['Zhu Y', 'Xu M', 'Ding C', 'Peng Z', 'Wang W', 'Sun B', 'Cheng J', 'Chen C', 'Chen W', 'Wei H', 'Hu Z']",2021,9,,Front Public Health,"Zhu Y, et al.

35111401,Reconstructing the transmission dynamics of varicella in Japan: an elevation of age at infection.,"BACKGROUND: In Japan, routine two-dose immunization against varicella has been conducted among children at ages of 12 and 36 months since 2014, and the vaccination coverage has reached around 90%. To understand the impact of routine varicella vaccination, we reconstructed the epidemiological dynamics of varicella in Japan.
METHODS: Epidemiological and demographic datasets over the past three decades were analyzed to reconstruct the number of susceptible individuals by age and year. To estimate the annual risk of varicella infection, we fitted a balance equation model to the annual number of cases from 1990 to 2019. Using parameter estimates, we reconstructed varicella dynamics starting from 1990 and modeled future dynamics until 2033.
RESULTS: Overall varicella incidence declined over time and the annual risk of infection among children younger than 10 years old decreased monotonically starting in 2014. Conversely, varicella incidence among teenagers (age 10 to 14 years) has increased each year since 2014. A substantial number of unvaccinated individuals born before the routine immunization era remained susceptible and aged without contracting varicella, while the annual risk of infection among teenagers aged 10 to 14 years increased starting in 2011 despite gradual expansion of varicella vaccine coverage. The number of susceptible individuals decreased over time in all age groups. Modeling indicated that susceptibility rates among pre-school children aged 1 to 4 years will remain low.
CONCLUSION: Routine varicella vaccination has successfully reduced infections in pre-school and early primary school age children, but has also resulted in increased infection rates among adolescents. This temporary increase was caused both by the increased age of susceptible individuals and increased transmission risk among adolescents resulting from the dynamic nature of varicella transmission. Monitoring susceptibility among adolescents will be important to prevent outbreaks over the next decade.","['Suzuki A', 'Nishiura H']",2022,10,,PeerJ,Suzuki A and Nishiura H.

35110974,The Dietary Use of Pigeon Pea for Human and Animal Diets.,"Pigeon pea (PP) [Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth] plays an important role in preserving poor smallholders' major source of income in the tropics and subtropics by improving food and feed security, particularly protein intake. In the meantime, protein deficiency is frequent in tropical and subtropical regions due to rapidly increasing human populations and the high cost of animal-origin proteins. As a result, pulse crops should be their primary source of protein. Among these, PP is the most important pulse crop utilized as a food component in rain-fed agricultural conditions with the lowest costs, and it is the best source of protein supplements in typical cereal-based diets to fill the nutritional deficit. Despite this, it is the world's least-used pulse crop. Therefore, the primary goal of this review was to provide and synthesize scientifically confirmed and up-to-date information on the dietary usage of pigeon pea for food and feed. Protein, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and essential amino acids are all present in reasonable amounts in both mature and immature PP seeds. PP has the most potential for usage as food and feed, and its nutrients are comparable to those of soybeans and maize. PP's green leaves, roots, seeds, and pods are high in phenolic compounds, which have anti-inflammation, antibacterial, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antidiabetic properties, as well as the ability to cure diseases like measles, smallpox, chicken pox, sickle cell anemia, fever, dysentery, hepatitis, and antimalarial medications for the body. Furthermore, the addition of pigeon pea and its by-products improves ruminant and nonruminant animal feeding performance significantly. In general, PP products such as dried grain, fresh (aerial portion), and green pods are used as a low-cost (low-cost) source of high-quality and quantity of protein food and feed for tropical and subtropical populations' livelihoods.",['Abebe B'],2022,2022,,ScientificWorldJournal,Abebe B.

35097099,"Varicella-zoster virus-associated meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis with sporadic skin blisters: A case report.","BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) generally causes chickenpox at first infection in childhood and then establishes latent infection in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord or other nerves. Virus reactivation owing to an impaired immune system causes inflammation along spinal nerves from the affected spinal segment, leading to skin manifestations (herpes zoster). Viremia and subsequent hematogenous transmission and nerve axonal transport of the virus may lead to meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis. One such case is described in this study.
CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old man presented with dysuria, pyrexia, and progressive disturbance in consciousness. He had signs of meningeal irritation, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed marked pleocytosis with mononuclear predominance and a CSF/serum glucose ratio of 0.64. Head magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense areas in the frontal lobes. He had four isolated blisters with papules and halos on his right chest, right lumbar region, and left scapular region. Infected giant cells were detected using the Tzanck test. Degenerated epidermal cells with intranuclear inclusion bodies and ballooning degeneration were present on skin biopsy. Serum VZV antibody titers suggested previous infection, and the CSF tested positive for VZV-DNA. He developed paraplegia, decreased temperature perception in the legs, urinary retention, and fecal incontinence. The patient was diagnosed with meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis and was treated with acyclovir for 23 days and prednisolone for 14 days. Despite gradual improvement, the urinary retention and gait disturbances persisted as sequelae.
CONCLUSION: VZV reactivation should be considered in differential diagnoses of patients with sporadic blisters and unexplained central nervous system symptoms.","['Takami K', 'Kenzaka T', 'Kumabe A', 'Fukuzawa M', 'Eto Y', 'Nakata S', 'Shinohara K', 'Endo K']",2022,10,2,World J Clin Cases,"Takami K, et al.

35093244,Varicella post-exposure management for pediatric oncology patients.,"INTRODUCTION: The objective was to evaluate health care providers' (HCP) adherence to and efficacy of varicella post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) recommendations. It was an observational, prospective, multicenter study set in Ile-de-France, France.
METHODS: All children under 18 with a cancer diagnosis, currently or within 3months of receiving cancer treatment, regardless of varicella zoster virus (VZV) serostatus or previous personal history of varicella, were eligible. Study participants with significant exposure were reviewed prospectively for PEP indications. Main outcome measures were the percentage of exposure situations for which HCP were guideline-compliant, the proportion of available VZV serostatuses and the incidence of breakthrough varicella after different PEP approaches.
RESULTS: A total of 51 patients from 15 centers were enrolled after 52 exposure episodes. Median age at exposure was 5 years (range, 1-15). Exposure within the household led to 38% of episodes. Prophylactic treatment consisted in specific anti-VZV immunoglobulins (V-ZIG) (n=19) or in oral aciclovir (n=15). No prophylactic treatment was given for 18 patients (in compliance, n=16). In compliance with guidelines, 17 patients received V-ZIG, 11 did not develop varicella (65%, [95% CI, 39-90%]); 15 received aciclovir, 13 did not develop varicella (87%, [95% CI, 67-100%]). Breakthrough varicella occurred in 11 patients, with simple clinical course in all cases; in 8/47 (17%) episodes when PEP was guideline-compliant versus 3/5 (60%) when not.
DISCUSSION: Recommendations have been respected and are efficient. PEP needs to be standardized and a study carried out to define the optimal approach. Anti-VZV immunization of seronegative family members should be encouraged.","['Costa G', 'Orbach D', 'Saulpic J', 'Sarda-Thibault H', 'Hanslik T', 'Brethon B', 'Tabone MD', 'Raimbault S', 'Papillard S', 'Guillaumat C', 'Nathanson S', 'Pellegrino B', 'Belloy M', 'Mesples B', 'Trioche P', 'Jaber H', 'Raimondo G', 'Gilet C', 'Cohen-Gogo S']",2022,109,3,Bull Cancer,"Costa G, et al.

The Italian National Health System was heavily affected, with detrimental impacts on preventive service delivery. Routine vaccination services were disrupted across the country during the first months of the pandemic, and both access to and demand for vaccines have decreased during the pandemic. In many cases, parents preferred to postpone scheduled appointments for routine paediatric vaccinations because of stay-at-home orders or fear of COVID-19 infection when accessing care. The objective of the current study was to assess the routine childhood vaccine coverage (VC) rates during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. We compared 2020 and 2019 VC by age group and vaccine type.

34994924,A Cross-Sectional Concept Elicitation Study to Understand the Impact of Herpes Zoster on Patients' Health-Related Quality of Life.,"INTRODUCTION: After a chickenpox infection, the varicella zoster virus lies dormant in nerve cells and can be reactivated in later life to cause herpes zoster (HZ), also called shingles, a painful rash that may result in persistent postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Treatment options are limited, and HZ/PHN may have substantial negative effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This qualitative cross-sectional study explored the subjective patient experience and impact on HRQoL of HZ and PHN in adults aged ≥ 50 years in Canada.
METHODS: Patients were eligible for the study if they were aged at least 50 years and had been diagnosed with HZ by a healthcare practitioner 7-60 days earlier for HZ patients and 90-365 days earlier for PHN patients. Eligible patients were invited to participate in concept elicitation interviews by telephone. Data from the interviews were transcribed and analyzed to identify key concepts related to symptoms and impacts on the patients' lives.
RESULTS: A total of 32 patients participated, with a mean age of 61 years. Most (72%) were female. The most common symptoms reported were rash (n = 32), pain (n = 31), fatigue (n = 26), and itchiness (n = 20). The most commonly reported HRQoL domains affected were emotional functioning (n = 31), activities of daily living (n = 31), sleep (n = 29), physical functioning (n = 25) and hobbies (n = 21). A conceptual model was developed to summarize these symptoms and impacts.
CONCLUSION: HZ negatively affected many dimensions of patients' HRQoL, particularly during the acute phase of illness.

34966138,Economic Evaluation of Universal Varicella Vaccination in Mexico.,"BACKGROUND: Universal varicella vaccination has proven to be cost-effective (CE) in countries where implemented. However, this has not been evaluated for Mexico.
METHODS: The yearly disease burden (varicella cases/deaths, outpatient visits, and hospitalizations) was derived from Mexican seroprevalence data adjusted to the 2020 population. The yearly economic burden was calculated by combining disease with Mexican unit cost data from both health care and societal perspectives. Four different vaccination strategies were evaluated: (1) 1 dose of varicella vaccine at 1 year old; (2) 2 doses at 1 and 6 years; (3) 1 dose of varicella vaccine at 1 year, and quadrivalent measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine at 6 years; (4) 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine at 1 and 6 years. We developed an economic model for each vaccination strategy where 20 consecutive birth cohorts were simulated. Vaccination impact (number of avoided cases/deaths) was evaluated for a 20-year follow-up period based on vaccine effectiveness (87% and 97.4% for 1 and 2 doses), and assuming a 95% coverage. We estimated annual costs saved, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and costs per life year gained.
RESULTS: Avoided cases during the 20-year follow-up with 1, and 2 doses were 20,570,722 and 23,029,751, respectively. Strategies 1 and 2 were found to be cost saving, and strategy 3 to be CE. Strategy 4 was not CE. Strategies 1 and 2 would allow saving annually $53.16 and $34.41 million USD, respectively, to the Mexican society.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal varicella vaccination, using 1 dose or 2 doses, would result in a cost-beneficial and CE public health intervention in Mexico.","['Chacon-Cruz E', 'Meroc E', 'Costa-Clemens SA', 'Clemens R', 'Verstraeten T']",2022,41,5,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Chacon-Cruz E, et al.

34930603,Modelling varicella vaccination - What does a lack of surge in herpes zoster incidence tell us about exogenous boosting?,"BACKGROUND: For decades, assessments of the impact of universal varicella vaccination on the epidemiology of varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) have been made using mathematical modelling. Decreased virus circulation and the resulting diminished exogenous boosting have been predicted to lead to a surge in HZ incidence. Lately, the exogenous boosting hypothesis has been challenged due to a lack of an extensive surge in HZ incidence in countries with, by now long-standing universal varicella vaccination.
METHODS: In a deterministic compartmental transmission model of varicella zoster virus disease, we model various levels and duration of protection from boosting to explore the impact of successful childhood varicella vaccination on HZ incidence.
RESULTS: Considering total HZ incidence, lifelong and strong protection from boosting give a stable incidence of HZ for about 60 years followed by a decline, whereas lifelong intermediate protection leads to a decline. So does weak protection of intermediate duration. Full and short protection, lead to a small surge, while full and intermediate protection lead to the largest HZ surge. HZ incidence by age group show that total incidence is the result of opposing increasing and decreasing trends in the various age groups over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of an extensive surge in HZ incidence after varicella vaccination can, especially during the first 20-30 years, occur in either strong, intermediate or weak boosting scenarios. The impact seems to depend on an interplay of the protective level and duration of the protection in determining the basic reactivation rate and the proportion of the population that is susceptible at the start of vaccination. However, the picture depends on whether the entire population or specific age groups are observed.","['Widgren K', 'Tomba GS', 'Leung KY', 'Giesecke J']",2022,40,4,Vaccine,"Widgren K, et al.

34930179,Economic burden of varicella in Europe in the absence of universal varicella vaccination.,"BACKGROUND: Though the disease burden of varicella in Europe has been reported previously, the economic burden is still unknown. This study estimated the economic burden of varicella in Europe in the absence of Universal Varicella Vaccination (UVV) in 2018 Euros from both payer (direct costs) and societal (direct and indirect costs) perspectives.
METHODS: We estimated the country specific and overall annual costs of varicella in absence of UVV in 31 European countries (27 EU countries, plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). To obtain country specific unit costs and associated healthcare utilization, we conducted a systematic literature review, searching in PubMed, EMBASE, NEED, DARE, REPEC, Open Grey, and public heath websites (1/1/1999-10/15/2019). The number of annual varicella cases, deaths, outpatient visits and hospitalizations were calculated (without UVV) based on age-specific incidence rates (Riera-Montes et al. 2017) and 2018 population data by country. Unit cost per varicella case and disease burden data were combined using stochastic modeling to estimate 2018 costs stratified by country, age and healthcare resource.
RESULTS: Overall annual total costs associated with varicella were estimated to be €662,592,061 (Range: €309,552,363 to €1,015,631,760) in Europe in absence of UVV. Direct and indirect costs were estimated at €229,076,206 (Range €144,809,557 to €313,342,856) and €433,515,855 (Range €164,742,806 to €702,288,904), respectively. Total cost per case was €121.45 (direct: €41.99; indirect: €79.46). Almost half of the costs were attributed to cases in children under 5 years, owing mainly to caregiver work loss. The distribution of costs by healthcare resource was similar across countries. France and Germany accounted for 49.28% of total annual costs, most likely due to a combination of high numbers of cases and unit costs in these countries.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of varicella across Europe in the absence of UVV is substantial (over 600 M€), primarily driven by caregiver burden including work productivity losses.","['Pawaskar M', 'Méroc E', 'Samant S', 'Flem E', 'Bencina G', 'Riera-Montes M', 'Heininger U']",2021,21,1,BMC Public Health,"Pawaskar M, et al.

34904194,Varicella Zoster Virus Neuronal Latency and Reactivation Modeled in Vitro.,"Latency and reactivation in neurons are critical aspects of VZV pathogenesis that have historically been difficult to investigate. Viral genomes are retained in many human ganglia after the primary infection, varicella; and about one-third of the naturally infected VZV seropositive population reactivates latent virus, which most often clinically manifests as herpes zoster (HZ or Shingles). HZ is frequently complicated by acute and chronic debilitating pain for which there remains a need for more effective treatment options. Understanding of the latent state is likely to be essential in the design of strategies to reduce reactivation. Experimentally addressing VZV latency has been difficult because of the strict human species specificity of VZV and the fact that until recently, experimental reactivation had not been achieved. We do not yet know the neuron subtypes that harbor latent genomes, whether all can potentially reactivate, what the drivers of VZV reactivation are, and how immunity interplays with the latent state to control reactivation. However, recent advances have enabled a picture of VZV latency to start to emerge. The first is the ability to detect the latent viral genome and its expression in human ganglionic tissues with extraordinary sensitivity. The second, the subject of this chapter, is the development of in vitro human neuron systems permitting the modeling of latent states that can be experimentally reactivated. This review will summarize recent advances of in vitro models of neuronal VZV latency and reactivation, the limitations of the current systems, and discuss outstanding questions and future directions regarding these processes using these and yet to be developed models. Results obtained from the in vitro models to date will also be discussed in light of the recent data gleaned from studies of VZV latency and gene expression learned from human cadaver ganglia, especially the discovery of VZV latency transcripts that seem to parallel the long-studied latency-associated transcripts of other neurotropic alphaherpesviruses.","['Goldstein RS', 'Kinchington PR']",2023,438,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Goldstein RS and Kinchington PR.

34903920,In ovo inhibition of avian pox virus replication by mangosteen rind and red ginger ethanolic extracts.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Avian pox is a contagious disease caused by the avian pox virus (APV). Mangostin and γ-mangostin in mangosteen rind (MR) and gingerol in red ginger (RG) exhibit antiviral activity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of MR and RG ethanolic extracts on APV based on pock lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three APVs from chicken isolates (C1, C2, and C3), one APV from a pigeon isolate (P), 1.5% and 3% MR ethanolic extract, 5% and 10% RG ethanolic extract, and a combination of 1.5% MR and 5% RG at 0.1 mL/egg were inoculated

34895220,Risk factors for some tropical diseases in an African country.,"BACKGROUND: Often, non-clinical risk factors could affect the predisposition of an individual to diseases. Understanding these factors and their impacts helps in disease prevention and control. This study identified risk factors for malaria, yellow fever, typhoid, chickenpox, measles, hepatitis B, and urinary tract infection in a population in an African country.
METHODS: Our study was an observational, correlational, and quantitative one that explored relationships among risk variables and disease prevalence - without modifying or controlling the variables. Data for this study was obtained through random sampling of a population of patients and physicians in the eastern/southern, western, and northern parts of Nigeria in 2015-2016. A total of 2199 patient consultation forms were returned by 102 (out of 125) physicians, and considered useful for analysis. Demographic data of patients, physicians, and diagnosis outcomes were analysed descriptively through frequency distributions, aggregate analysis, and graphs. The influence of risk factors on the disease manifestations (diagnosis outcomes) was determined using regression analysis.
RESULTS: Our results show that living in a tropical climate is by far a major risk factor associated with tropical diseases (malaria: t = 19.9, typhoid: t = - 3.2, chickenpox: t = - 6.5 and typhoid: t = 12.7). The risk for contracting infections is relative to specific diseases; for example, contact with chickenpox infected person poses a high risk of contracting the virus (t = 41.8), while poor personal hygiene predisposes people to high risk of urinary tract infection (t = 23.6). On the other hand, urbanization and homelessness pose very low risks of disposing the individual to the diseases under consideration, while low fluid intake, lack of voiding, and wearing non-cotton underwear predispose individuals to few diseases.
CONCLUSION: The risk factors identified in our study exert differential and discriminating influences in the causation, predisposition, and transmission of these disease studied. It is recommended that significant effort be devoted by governments in the tropics to the mitigation of these modifiable risk factors. The most important strategy to mitigate the occurrence of these risk factors will be improving the living conditions of people and the provision of social protection measures to reduce the occurrence and burden of these diseases.","['Uzoka FE', 'Akwaowo C', 'Nwafor-Okoli C', 'Ekpin V', 'Nwokoro C', 'El Hussein M', 'Osuji J', 'Aladi F', 'Akinnuwesi B', 'Akpelishi TF']",2021,21,1,BMC Public Health,"Uzoka FE, et al.

34893015,Effectiveness of varicella vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis: a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effectiveness of varicella vaccine (VarV) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) among children during varicella outbreaks.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SinoMed, Wanfang and CNKI. Relevant outcomes included the incidence of varicella. Pooled estimates were calculated using a fixed-effects or random-effects model according to the heterogeneity among studies.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies with 7,474 children that received one or two dosages of VarV as PEP and 183,827 children who received no VarV were included in the meta-analysis. In total, one-dose and two-dose VarV as PEP had 43% (95% confidence interval (CI):27%, 55%) and 60% (95%CI: 35%, 75%) efficacy, respectively. When PEP was applied within 3 days, the pooled VarV as PEP for prevention of varicella was 80% (95%CI: 68%, 88%); when PEP was administered beyond 3 days, the pooled VarV as PEP for the prevention of varicella was 50% (95%CI: 11%, 72%). If the PEP was implemented with a coverage of more than 80%, the VarV could prevent 82% of varicella cases from occurring (95%CI: 15%, 96%); if the PEP covered a maximum of 80% of the susceptible cases, the VarV could prevent 65% of varicella cases from occurring (95%CI: 50%, 76%).
CONCLUSION: The two-dose VarV had better efficacy than one-dose VarV in the control of varicella outbreaks, especially if PEP was applied within 3 days of an outbreak and in conjunction with a high coverage rate ≥80%.","['Chen D', 'Li Y', 'Wu Q']",2021,17,12,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Chen D, et al.

34851413,The Childhood Vaccination Schedule and the Lack of Association With Type 1 Diabetes.,"OBJECTIVES: Safety studies assessing the association between the entire recommended childhood immunization schedule and autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), are lacking. To examine the association between the recommended immunization schedule and T1DM, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of children born between 2004 and 2014 in 8 US health care organizations that participate in the Vaccine Safety Datalink.
METHODS: Three measures of the immunization schedule were assessed: average days undervaccinated (ADU), cumulative antigen exposure, and cumulative aluminum exposure. T1DM incidence was identified by International Classification of Disease codes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze associations between the 3 exposure measures and T1DM incidence. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Models were adjusted for sex, race and ethnicity, birth year, mother's age, birth weight, gestational age, number of well-child visits, and study site.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 584 171 children, the mean ADU was 38 days, the mean cumulative antigen exposure was 263 antigens (SD = 54), and the mean cumulative aluminum exposure was 4.11 mg (SD = 0.73). There were 1132 incident cases of T1DM. ADU (aHR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02) and cumulative antigen exposure (aHR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-1.00) were not associated with T1DM. Cumulative aluminum exposure >3.00 mg was inversely associated with T1DM (aHR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: The recommended schedule is not positively associated with the incidence of T1DM in children. These results support the safety of the recommended childhood immunization schedule.","['Glanz JM', 'Clarke CL', 'Daley MF', 'Shoup JA', 'Hambidge SJ', 'Williams JTB', 'Groom HC', 'Kharbanda EO', 'Klein NP', 'Jackson LA', 'Lewin BJ', 'McClure DL', 'Xu S', 'DeStefano F']",2021,148,6,Pediatrics,"Glanz JM, et al.

We have explained the causes of epidemics along with their preventive measures, the impact of lockdown on the health of people and the economy of a country. Several reports have revealed the transmission of infection during epidemic from the contact of an infected person to the public that can be prevented by implementing the lockdown by the government of a country. Though lockdown has been considered as one of the significant parameters to control the diseases, however, it has some negative consequences on the health of people as they can be more prone to other ailments like obesity, diabetes, cardiac problems etc. and drastic decline in the economy of a country. Therefore, the transmission of diseases can be prevented by warning the people about the severity of diseases, avoiding their public transportation, keeping themselves isolated, strictly following the guidelines of lockdown and encouraging regular exercise.","['Suleman S', 'Farooqui A', 'Sharma P', 'Malhotra N', 'Yadav N', 'Narang J', 'Hasnain MS', 'Nayak AK']",2022,29,6,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Suleman S, et al.

34839275,[Association of acute retinal necrosis with ischemic stroke].,"Összefoglaló. A varicella zoster vírus (VZV-) fertőzés típusos első megjelenése a bárányhimlő, később a reaktiváció során a herpes zoster. Szemészeti tünet az V/I-es agyideget érintő zoster esetén gyakori. A legrettegettebb szemészeti manifesztáció az akut retinanekrózis, mely fulmináns lefolyású, és súlyos szöveti destrukciót, valamint jelentős funkcionális károsodást, gyakran vakságot hagy maga után. Központi idegrendszeri vascularis érintettség előfordulhat bárányhimlőhöz társulóan vagy a későbbi reaktivációk során is, súlyos következményekhez vezetve. A Semmelweis Egyetem Szemészeti Klinikáján akut retinanekrózis tünetével érkező 65 éves férfi esetét ismertetjük. Az Amerikai Szemorvostársaság (AAO) diagnosztikus kritériumainak mindenben megfelelő klinikai kép alapján azonnal indított adekvát dózisú antivirális kezelés mellett 3 nap múlva, contralateralis hemiparesis hátterében, a képalkotó vizsgálat ipsilateralis ischaemiás stroke-ot igazolt. Intraocularis mintából PCR-vizsgálat bizonyította a vírus jelenlétét. Liquormintában enyhe anti-VZV-IgA-pozitivitás mutatkozott. Az aktuális szemészeti betegség és a stroke társulásának hátterében az észlelt paraméterek, valamint a releváns irodalmi adatok alapján a varicella zoster vírus okozta vasculopathiát valószínűsítettük. Gyermekkorban ez az ischaemiás stroke leggyakoribb oka, felnőttkorban pedig az V/I-es agyideg herpeses érintettsége esetén négy és félszeres a kockázat stroke kialakulására. A VZV-reaktiváció okozta akut retinanekrózis és a stroke társulásának lehetősége, bár ismert a nemzetközi irodalomban, magyar szakirodalom tudomásunk szerint eddig nem tárgyalta, ez kiemeli esetünk közlésének jelentőségét. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(48): 1940-1945. Summary. The typical first onset of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection is chickenpox, later herpes zoster during reactivation. Ophthalmic symptoms are common in herpes zoster affecting the V/I cranial nerve. The most dreaded ophthalmic manifestation is acute retinal necrosis, which has a fulminant course and leaves severe tissue damage as well as significant functional impairment, often blindness. Vascular involvement in the central nervous system may occur in association with chickenpox or during subsequent reactivations leading to severe consequences. We report the case of a 65-year-old male patient with symptoms of acute retinal necrosis at the Department of Ophthalmology, Semmelweis University. The clinical picture fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and after 3 days of the immediately initiated adequate therapy, contralateral hemiparesis appeared, that was confirmed as an ipsilateral stroke by imaging study. The PCR analysis of an intraocular sample confirmed the presence of VZV. Mild anti-VZV IgA positivity was observed in the cerebrospinal fluid sample. Based on the current ophthalmic disease, the associated stroke alongside with the relevant literature data, varicella zoster vasculopathy was probable. VZV vasculopathy is the most common cause of ischemic stroke in childhood and in adulthood herpetic involvement of the V/I cranial nerve elevates 4.5 times the risk of stroke formation. Though the possible association of acute retinal necrosis and stroke caused by VZV reactivation is known in the international literature, to the best of our knowledge it has not been discussed in Hungary so far, which highlights the importance of reporting our case.

34836716,Effect of universal varicella vaccination and behavioral changes against coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the incidence of herpes zoster.,"BACKGROUND: Since 2014, universal varicella vaccination has reduced the varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) incidence in vaccine recipients and increased the incidence in the child-rearing generation until 2017.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the future epidemiologic trends of HZ after the disappearance of varicella epidemics and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
METHODS: The Miyazaki Dermatologist Society has been monitoring and analyzing the incidence of HZ patients after universal vaccination since 1997.
RESULTS: The HZ incidence in Oka varicella vaccine recipients aged 0-4 years decreased with the reduction in chickenpox incidence. The HZ incidence among those aged 5-9 years increased between 2015 and 2017 and decreased thereafter. From 2014-2020, the HZ incidence continued to increase to 36.6%, 51.3%, 70.2%, 56.7%, and 27.3% among those aged 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 years, respectively. The HZ incidence in patients aged ≥ 60 years increased by 2.3% annually from 2014 to 2020, corresponding to an annual 2% increase since 1997, and was unaffected by varicella epidemics. COVID-19 infection control measures, lifestyle changes and the resulting stress did not affect the HZ incidence in 2020.
CONCLUSION: Universal varicella vaccination eliminated varicella epidemics, and HZ was reduced in vaccine recipients. The HZ incidence for those aged 10-59 years increased from 2014 to 2020, in contrast to those aged ≥ 60 years, which is attributable to booster immunity expiration due to varicella contact in this age group.","['Shiraki K', 'Toyama N', 'Tanaka K', 'Ito A', 'Yamamoto J', 'members of the Miyazaki Dermatologist Society']",2021,104,3,J Dermatol Sci,"Shiraki K, et al.

Varicella vaccine meningitis has been diagnosed in 12 children, of whom 3 were immunocompromised. We now report two additional cases of vaccine meningitis in twice-immunized immunocompetent children and we perform further testing on a prior third case. We used three methods to diagnose or investigate cases of varicella vaccine meningitis, none of which have been used previously on this disease. These include metagenomic next-generation sequencing and cytokine multiplex profiling of cerebrospinal fluid and immunology exome analysis of white blood cells. In one new case, the diagnosis was confirmed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid. Both varicella vaccine virus and human herpesvirus 7 DNA were detected. We performed cytokine multiplex profiling on the cerebrospinal fluid of two cases and found ten elevated biomarkers: interferon gamma, interleukins IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17F, chemokines CXCL-9, CXCL-10, CCL-2, and G-CSF. In a second new case, we performed immunology exome sequencing on a panel of 356 genes, but no errors were found. After a review of all 14 cases, we concluded that (i) there is no common explanation for this adverse event, but (ii) ingestion of an oral corticosteroid burst 3-4 weeks before onset of vaccine meningitis may be a risk factor in some cases.","['Ramachandran PS', 'Wilson MR', 'Catho G', 'Blanchard-Rohner G', 'Schiess N', 'Cohrs RJ', 'Boutolleau D', 'Burrel S', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Wapniarski A', 'Heusel EH', 'Carpenter JE', 'Jackson W', 'Ford BA', 'Grose C']",2021,13,11,Viruses,"Ramachandran PS, et al.

34831809,Pediatric Hospitalization for Varicella in an Italian Pediatric Hospital: How Much Does It Cost?,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is a common pediatric infection. Even if it generally has a benign course, it may complicate and require hospitalization. The aim of our study was to estimate the acute hospitalization cost (AHC) for varicella in the acute phase in a pediatric population.
METHODS: We calculated the AHC of pediatric patients admitted for varicella at Bambino Gesù Children Hospital, Rome, Italy, from 1 November 2005 to 1 November 2020.
RESULTS: In the study period, 825 pediatric patients affected by varicella were hospitalized. The mean hospitalization cost was EUR 4015.35 (range from EUR 558.44 to EUR 42,608.00). Among patients, 55% were unvaccinable due to either their age or their immunosuppression status. They would benefit from herd immunity, reducing the overall AHC by EUR 182,196,506. Since the introduction of the compulsory vaccination against varicella in Italy, we observed a significant reduction in AHC cost of 60.6% in 2019 and of 93.5% in 2020. Finally, from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we documented a decline of 81.2% and 76.9% in varicella hospitalization, compared to 2018 and 2019, respectively.

34806766,"Vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in children.","BACKGROUND: Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) are serious diseases that can lead to serious complications, disability, and death. However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. This is an update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, safety, and long- and short-term adverse effects associated with the trivalent vaccine, containing measles, rubella, mumps strains (MMR), or concurrent administration of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or tetravalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella strains (MMRV), given to children aged up to 15 years.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 5), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 2 May 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (2 May 2019), and ClinicalTrials.gov (2 May 2019).
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (PCS/RCS), case-control studies (CCS), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, case cross-over (CCO) studies, case-only ecological method (COEM) studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS) studies, person-time cohort (PTC) studies, and case-coverage design/screening methods (CCD/SM) studies, assessing any combined MMR or MMRV / MMR+V vaccine given in any dose, preparation or time schedule compared with no intervention or placebo, on healthy children up to 15 years of age.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design, vaccine type (MMR, MMRV, MMR+V), virus strain, and study settings. Outcomes of interest were cases of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and harms. Certainty of evidence of was rated using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 138 studies (23,480,668 participants). Fifty-one studies (10,248,159 children) assessed vaccine effectiveness and 87 studies (13,232,509 children) assessed the association between vaccines and a variety of harms. We included 74 new studies to this 2019 version of the review. Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness in preventing measles was 95% after one dose (relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13; 7 cohort studies; 12,039 children; moderate certainty evidence) and 96% after two doses (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28; 5 cohort studies; 21,604 children; moderate certainty evidence). The effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts or preventing transmission to others the children were in contact with after one dose was 81% (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89; 3 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence), after two doses 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75; 3 cohort studies; 378 children; low certainty evidence), and after three doses was 96% (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; 2 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness (at least one dose) in preventing measles after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50; 2 cohort studies; 283 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR vaccine in preventing mumps was 72% after one dose (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76; 6 cohort studies; 9915 children; moderate certainty evidence), 86% after two doses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35; 5 cohort studies; 7792 children; moderate certainty evidence). Effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 3 cohort studies; 1036 children; moderate certainty evidence).  Vaccine effectiveness against rubella, using a vaccine with the BRD2 strain which is only used in China, is 89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 1 cohort study; 1621 children; moderate certainty evidence).  Vaccine effectiveness against varicella (any severity) after two doses in children aged 11 to 22 months is 95% in a 10 years follow-up (rate ratio (rr) 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; 1 RCT; 2279 children; high certainty evidence). Safety There is evidence supporting an association between aseptic meningitis and MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains, but no evidence supporting this association for MMR vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn mumps strains (rr 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56; low certainty evidence). The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR/MMR+V/MMRV vaccines (Jeryl Lynn strain) and febrile seizures. Febrile seizures normally occur in 2% to 4% of healthy children at least once before the age of 5. The attributable risk febrile seizures vaccine-induced is estimated to be from 1 per 1700 to 1 per 1150 administered doses. The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk of ITP after vaccination is smaller than after natural infection with these viruses. Natural infection of ITP occur in 5 cases per 100,000 (1 case per 20,000) per year. The attributable risk is estimated about 1 case of ITP per 40,000 administered MMR doses. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and encephalitis or encephalopathy (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61; 2 observational studies; 1,071,088 children; low certainty evidence), and autistic spectrum disorders (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 2 observational studies; 1,194,764 children; moderate certainty). There is insufficient evidence to determine the association between MMR immunisation and inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.16; 3 observational studies; 409 cases and 1416 controls; moderate certainty evidence). Additionally, there is no evidence supporting an association between MMR immunisation and cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR/MMRV vaccines support their use for mass immunisation. Campaigns aimed at global eradication should assess epidemiological and socioeconomic situations of the countries as well as the capacity to achieve high vaccination coverage. More evidence is needed to assess whether the protective effect of MMR/MMRV could wane with time since immunisation.","['Di Pietrantonj C', 'Rivetti A', 'Marchione P', 'Debalini MG', 'Demicheli V']",2021,11,11,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Di Pietrantonj C, et al.

34799967,Vaccination in children with inherited bleeding disorders: Does the use of plasma an d factor affect the response to the vaccine: An institutional registry.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate the vaccine seroconversion of paediatric patients with factor deficiency and to complete the missing vaccines. We also emphasize the importance of variables such as recombinant factor and plasma intake frequency.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective observational study includes children between 2 and 17 age diagnosed with inhered factor deficiency. Seroconversion of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella, measles, rubella and mumps vaccines were screened according to Ministry of Health Vaccination Schedule, it was completed if there were seronegative vaccines and the vaccine seroconversion was examined after vaccination approximately 1-6 months.
RESULTS: A total of 61 children were included in the study [mean age 11.2±5.1 years (2-18)], 49 (80.3%) were males. Factor VIII deficiency constituted 60.7%, factor XI 14.8%, factor VII 13.1 %, factor IX 9.8%, factor X 1.6% of the cases. None of the children had clinically important injection site complications such as uncontrollable bleeding or gross hematoma and vaccination does not induce the development of inhibitor. Measles antibody positivity was significantly lower in those who received factor 3 or 4 days times a week compared to those who received it when necessary (p = .049).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating the vaccine conversion patients with inherited factor deficiency receiving plasma and plasma derived factor concentrates. It should be considered that children with haemophilia and their families may have vaccination hesitancy; therefore, follow-up of these patients should include a specified vaccination program to ensure adequate immunization of these patients.","['Tasar S', 'Tasar MA', 'Alioglu B']",2022,28,1,Haemophilia,"Tasar S, et al.

This study aimed to assess the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and outcomes in patients with human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), human herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) CNS infections.We identified cases of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV CNS infections and reviewed their clinical and laboratory characteristics. The study population was drawn from patients with HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV polymerase chain reaction positivity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) who visited Pusan National University Hospital between 2010 and 2018.During the 9-year study period, a total of 727 CSF samples were examined, with 72.2% (525/727) patients identified as having a CNS infection. Of 471 patients with aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, the causative virus was identified in 145 patients, and no virus was detected in 337 patients. A total of 15.2% (80/525) were diagnosed with one of the 3 herpesviruses as causative agents, 59 patients had meningitis, and 21 patients had encephalitis. Eleven patients with HSV-1, 27 patients with HSV-2, and 42 patients with VZV CNS infections were included. The distribution of cases by age showed different patterns depending on the type of herpesvirus infection. Compared with the HSV-1 group, the median age in the HSV-2 group was younger (HSV-1: 58 years; HSV-2: 38 years; P = .004), and patients with VZV infections showed a bimodal age distribution. Encephalitis was more common in the HSV-1 group, and HSV-1 infection was associated with a poor prognosis at discharge. CSF white blood cell counts were significantly lower in patients infected with HSV-1 (117 × 106 cells/L) than in patients infected with VZV (301 × 106 cells/L) (P = .008).These 3 herpesviruses are important causes of CNS infections regardless of immunologic status. HSV-1 infection was commonly associated with encephalitis and poor prognosis; HSV-2 and VZV CNS infections were associated with a low risk of mortality and neurological sequelae.","['Lee GH', 'Kim J', 'Kim HW', 'Cho JW']",2021,100,46,Medicine (Baltimore),"Lee GH, et al.

34794269,[Understanding of Smallpox in Ancient China].,"Smallpox was believed afferent before the Sui Dynasty. Some relatively accurate descriptions about smallpox were found in the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Smallpox was recognized as a severe infectious disease caused by pathogenic heat by the observation of its symptoms and appearance. It was believed that smallpox was caused by the heat accumulation in the Zang-Fu organs in the early period of the North Song Dynasty. After that, it was believed caused by the fetus ingesting the filthy liquid from the mother as the prototype of the fetal poison theory. This means that ancient Chinese physicians were able to distinguish the differences among chickenpox, measles and smallpox at that time. The exogenous theory of fetal poison became the mainstream in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Smallpox, therefore, was confirmed not to be re-infected after once infection, and was specifically described with the symptoms and the precise prognosis. It can be seen that the understanding of smallpox by ancient Chinese physicians developed with time, and these understandings opened a way for the invention of the human pox vaccination.","['Zhang YM', 'Niu YH']",2021,51,5,Zhonghua Yi Shi Za Zhi,Zhang YM and Niu YH.

IPF leads to an autoantibody-mediated decrease in the plasma concentration of protein S. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study involving patients with IPF from 13 French pediatric centers and a systematic review of cases in published literature. Eighteen patients were included in our case series, and 34 patients were included as literature review cases. The median age was 4.9 years, and the diagnostic delay after the first signs of viral infection was 7 days. The lower limbs were involved in 49 patients (94%) with typical lesions. In all, 41 patients (78%) had a recent history of varicella-zoster virus infection, and 7 patients (14%) had been infected by HHV-6. Most of the patients received heparin (n = 51; 98%) and fresh frozen plasma transfusions (n = 41; 79%); other treatment options were immunoglobulin infusion, platelet transfusion, corticosteroid therapy, plasmapheresis, and coagulation regulator concentrate infusion. The antithrombin level and platelet count at diagnosis seemed to be associated with severe complications. Given the rarity of this disease, the creation of a prospective international registry is required to consolidate these findings.","['Theron A', 'Dautremay O', 'Boissier E', 'Zerroukhi A', 'Baleine J', 'Moulis L', 'Rodière M', 'Schved JF', 'Duraes M', 'Kanouni T', 'Cau-Diaz I', 'Jeziorski E', 'Biron-Andreani C']",2022,6,2,Blood Adv,"Theron A, et al.

SVV infection of nonhuman primates is used as an experimental model to investigate varicella pathogenesis and to develop antiviral strategies.
METHODS: An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect SVV antibodies in infected rhesus macaque monkeys.
RESULTS: An ELISA determined SVV antibody titers following experimental infection. SVV IgG was detected by day 14 post-infection and remained elevated for at least 84 days.
CONCLUSIONS: The SVV ELISA is a safe and rapid approach to confirm SVV seropositivity and to determine SVV antibody titers in naturally and experimentally SVV-infected monkeys. In addition to being a useful diagnostic assay to rapidly confirm acute disease or past SVV infection, the SVV ELISA is a valuable epidemiological tool to determine the incidence of SVV in non-human primate facilities.","['Gray WL', 'Wichman G', 'Das A', 'Traina-Dorge V']",2022,51,1,J Med Primatol,"Gray WL, et al.

METHODS: This is an ecological study using publicly available databases in England and Wales; the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England and the Patient Episode Database for Wales. Hospital admissions data were collected for the period between April 1999 and March 2019. Hospital admissions due to viral infections characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions were identified using the tenth version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases system, diagnostic codes B00-B09. The trend in hospital admissions was assessed using a Poisson model.
RESULTS: Hospital admissions for different causes increased by 51.9% (from 25.67 (95% CI 25.23-26.10) in 1999 to 38.98 (95% CI 38.48-39.48) in 2019 per 100,000 persons, trend test, 
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates an evident variation in hospital admission of viral infections characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions based on age and gender. Efforts should be directed towards vaccinating high-risk groups, particularly the elderly and females. Moreover, efforts should be focused on vaccinating the young population against varicella, particularly females who are more susceptible to acquiring the infection.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive and life-threatening syndrome of overactivation of the immune system. We present a case of a 20-month-old boy who was referred to an oncology clinic because of HLH suspicion. In the preceding time, our patient suffered from a severe form of chickenpox with prolonged fever. Tests including myelogram, cerebrospinal fluid, and magnetic resonance (MR) of the brain gave a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia from B lymphocyte precursors, without occupying the central nervous system. To exclude inherited HLH in our patient, next-generation sequencing was performed, which revealed a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 15 of the PSTPIP1 gene (c.1213C>T, R405C). No mutations of genes associated with familial HLH syndrome were found. Our patient may be evidence that autoinflammatory diseases caused by PSTPIP1 gene mutations are not limited to the classical pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) phenotype but may have a different clinical presentation, and the spectrum of the PSTPIP1-associated inflammatory diseases (PAID) syndrome is more extensive than previously thought.","['Gowin E', 'Bąbol-Pokora K', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D']",2021,46,2,Cent Eur J Immunol,"Gowin E, et al.

34759418,Evaluation of Dermoscopic Patterns of Vesiculobullous Disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical diagnosis of vesiculobullous disorders (VBD) is not always straightforward. It is a challenge for a dermatologist to make the right diagnosis noninvasively in a short time.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dermoscopic patterns associated with vesiculobullous disorders.
METHODS: A total of 230 patients, irrespective of age and gender, with a history and clinical presentation suggestive of VBD (including primarily infectious, inflammatory, genetic, antibody-mediated, mechanical, environmental, metabolic, and drug-related) were recruited into the study. Patients with secondarily infected lesions were excluded. Dermoscopic examination along with Tzanck smear/skin biopsy smear test was performed on the most representative lesions. Data were compiled and statistically analyzed using SPSS version 21.0.
RESULTS: Lesions with erythematous (vascular) and yellowish (serum) translucent background with regular margins were seen in most of the VBD studied. Chickenpox (CP) and herpes zoster (HZ) lesions evolved with the progress of their clinical stages. Follicular and eccrine openings were commonly seen, but the pigmentation around them was specific to pemphigus vulgaris. A distorted pigment network was noted in bullous pemphigoid. White rosettes (keratin blockage) were characteristic of epidermolysis bullosa, Wickham striae (orthokeratosis) of lichen planus, and crumpled fabric appearance (flaccidity) of Hailey-Hailey disease. Globules/dots (microvesicles) of different colors were also seen in various VBD. Blue/black color usually corresponded to retained melanin.

34758734,Assessing the use of antibiotics and the burden of varicella in Belgium using a retrospective GP database analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is a highly contagious infection that typically occurs in childhood. While most cases have a generally benign outcome, infection results in a considerable healthcare burden and serious complications may occur.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize the burden of varicella in a real-world primary care setting in Belgium, including the rate of varicella-related complications, medication management and general practitioner (GP) visits.
METHODS: The study was a retrospective observational study using data from a longitudinal patient database in a primary care setting in Belgium. Patients with a GP visit and a varicella diagnosis between January 2016 and June 2019 were eligible and data one month prior and three months after the diagnosis were included. Outcomes included varicella-related complications, antibiotic use, antiviral use, and GP follow-up visits. Antibiotic use could be specified by class of antibiotic and linked to a diagnosis. Complications were identified based on concomitant diagnosis with varicella during the study period.
RESULTS: 3,847 patients with diagnosis of varicella were included, with a mean age of 8.4 years and a comparable distribution of gender. 12.6% of patients with varicella had a concomitant diagnosis of a varicella-related complication. During the follow-up period, 27.3% of patients with varicella were prescribed antibiotics, either systemic (19.8%) and/or topical (10.3%). The highest rate of antibiotic prescriptions was observed in patients with complications (63.5%) and in patients younger than 1 year (41.8%). Nevertheless, 5.3% of the patients were prescribed antibiotics without a concomitant diagnosis of another infection. The most commonly prescribed systemic antibiotics were amoxicillin alone or combined with beta-lactamase inhibitor, and thiamphenicol. Fusidic acid and tobramycin were the most prescribed topical antibiotics. Antivirals were prescribed for 2.7% of the study population. 4.7% of the patients needed a follow-up visit with their GP.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic, clinical, morphological characteristics, outcomes, and timing of development of herpes zoster to the various COVID-19 vaccines. And to identify on whether COVID-19 vaccine has temporal relationship between development of herpes zoster (HZ).
METHODS: We have performed a systemic review of articles from PubMed and Embase using MeSH and keywords like ""Shingles,"" ""Herpes zoster,"" ""Varicella zoster,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""Vaccine,"" ""SARS-CoV-2."" No filters including country of publication, language, type of articles were applied. Individual case report references were filtered for any pertinent cases.
RESULTS: A total of 54 cases consisting of 27 male and 27 female patients have been reported. There were cases with known risk factors for herpes zoster, which included age more than 50 years (n = 36), immunological disorders (n = 10), chronic disease (n = 25), metabolic disorder (n = 13), malignancy (n = 4), and psychiatric disorder (n = 2). The mean (SD) period between development of herpes zoster and COVID-19 vaccination was 7.64 (6.92) days. Majority of the cases were from the high-income and/or middle-income countries. 86.27% of the cases of HZ were reported due to mRNA vaccine. Thirty-six patients 36/45 (80%) developed herpes zoster following the priming dose of COVID-19 vaccine among those who received mRNA vaccine.

Chicken pox is generally a mild disease of childhood with a secondary attack rate of >85%, but disseminated VZV infection with visceral involvement and fatal outcome may occur in immunocompromised individuals. Indian Academy of Pediatrics recommends two doses of live-attenuated varicella vaccine in healthy unexposed children at 15-18 months and then at 4-6 years of age. The effectiveness of a single dose of vaccine is around 85% and with a two-dose schedule is as high as 92%. Despite the vaccine-induced protection, community-acquired VZV infections still remain a problem in immunocompromised population. We hereby report a case of a previously immunized pediatric liver-transplant recipient who acquired VZV infection. This case report clearly highlights the importance of strict environmental infection control practices, early suspicion, diagnosis, and management in such cases.","['Mehta V', 'Ramachandran K', 'Agarwal R', 'Alam S', 'Pamecha V', 'Gupta E']",2021,13,3,J Glob Infect Dis,"Mehta V, et al.

Stage 2 of this Phase 3 open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03843632) enrolled 100 healthy infants, children, and adolescents (12 months-6 years, n = 37; 7-12 years, n = 33; 13-17 years, n = 30) without a clinical history of varicella. Participants aged 12 months-12 years were administered 1 dose of VARIVAX™ 0.5 mL (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live [Oka/Merck]) and adolescents aged 13-17 years were administered 2 doses 6 weeks apart. For participants seronegative at baseline (VZV antibody titer <1.25 glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [gpELISA] units/mL), immunogenicity was assessed by seroconversion (VZV antibody titer ≥5 gpELISA units/mL) and VZV antibody geometric mean titers 6 weeks after the final dose. For participants who were VZV seropositive at baseline (VZV antibody titer ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL), immunogenicity was assessed by antibody titer geometric mean fold rise and percentage of participants with ≥4-fold rise in antibody titer 6 weeks after the final dose. A Vaccine Report Card was used to report solicited and unsolicited adverse events through 42 days post-vaccination. After series completion among seronegative participants across age groups (n = 74), 98.6% demonstrated seroconversion 6 weeks post-vaccination; among seropositive participants (n = 26), 65.4% had ≥4-fold rise in antibody titer 6 weeks post-vaccination. No new safety signals were observed.

34696448,Recent Issues in Varicella-Zoster Virus Latency.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpes virus which causes varicella (chicken pox) as a primary infection, and, following a variable period of latency in neurons in the peripheral ganglia, may reactivate to cause herpes zoster (shingles) as well as a variety of neurological syndromes. In this overview we consider some recent issues in alphaherpesvirus latency with special focus on VZV ganglionic latency. A key question is the nature and extent of viral gene transcription during viral latency. While it is known that this is highly restricted, it is only recently that the very high degree of that restriction has been clarified, with both VZV gene 63-encoded transcripts and discovery of a novel VZV transcript (VLT) that maps antisense to the viral transactivator gene 61. It has also emerged in recent years that there is significant epigenetic regulation of VZV gene transcription, and the mechanisms underlying this are complex and being unraveled. The last few years has also seen an increased interest in the immunological aspects of VZV latency and reactivation, in particular from the perspective of inborn errors of host immunity that predispose to different VZV reactivation syndromes.","['Kennedy PGE', 'Mogensen TH', 'Cohrs RJ']",2021,13,10,Viruses,"Kennedy PGE, et al.

34692971,Integrated community based human and animal syndromic surveillance in Adadle district of the Somali region of Ethiopia.,"UNLABELLED: The economy of Ethiopia largely depends on agriculture and roughly 80% of the households have direct contact with domestic animals which make the community vulnerable to zoonotic diseases, especially in pastoral areas like the Somali Regional State (SRS) of Ethiopia. However, in addition to low reporting rates, especially in livestock, there is also lack of coordination between public health and animal health surveillance and there is no linkage between public health system and animal health system and mechanism or structure for sharing information on zoonotic diseases in SRS. In view of these challenges, a small scale study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of mobile communication in the early detection of human and animal syndromes in remote pastoral areas including where there are no human and animal health facilities by engaging local communities in the diseases surveillance.
METHOD: A small scale study, testing a community based human and animal syndromic surveillance was conducted from August 2017 to February 2018 in 20 villages in four Kebeles of Adadle district in the SRS with an estimated 1390 households and 112,850 livestock. The selected community leaders were trained on disease surveillance and detection. The communication was done by direct calls. Two dollars per month were provided to the village leaders recruited for the surveillance.
RESULTS: A total of 904 and 671 human and animal syndrome cases were reported in seven months of the study period. In addition to syndromes, suspected anthrax, sheep and goat pox (SGP), rabies, salmonellosis and mass abortion outbreaks were reported in animals. In humans, suspected cholera and chicken pox outbreaks were reported. Furthermore, tuberculosis and malaria cases were also confirmed in the study villages. In humans, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorder was the most common syndrome observed, which constituted (42.8%) of all syndromes, followed by respiratory disorder (37.8%) and febrile illness (15.5%). In livestock, cattle contributed (40.8%) of all cases of illness, while sheep, goats and camels contributed 24.1%, 18% and 17% of the cases respectively. Responses were organized for emergency treatment and vaccination campaigns against certain suspected disease outbreaks and emergencies such as SGP and cholera.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that engaging and empowering the village local leaders in disease surveillance in pastoral setting areas, including where there are no human and animal health facilities, coupled with mobile technologies (non-smart phone), would improve early detection and response to human and animal health events including zoonotic emergencies, and consequently improve the reporting rate at district, regional and national level. However, the collaboration between sectors (human health and animals health) and the capacity to respond to zoonotic diseases and etiological identification are crucial elements for effective integrated human and animals disease surveillance and response.","['Osman Y', 'Ali SM', 'Schelling E', 'Tschopp R', 'Hattendorf J', 'Muhumed A', 'Zinsstag J']",2021,13,,One Health,"Osman Y, et al.

34673809,Parental acceptance and knowledge of varicella vaccination in relation to socioeconomics in Sweden: A cross-sectional study.,"Varicella infection is a highly contagious disease which, whilst mild in most cases, can cause severe complications. Varicella vaccination is available privately in Sweden and is currently being reviewed for inclusion in the Swedish Public Health Agency's national immunisation program (NIP). A cross-sectional study of parents of Swedish children aged 1-8 years (n = 2212) was conducted to understand parental acceptance, beliefs and knowledge around varicella infection and vaccination. Respondents generally viewed varicella infection as a mild disease, with only a small proportion aware of potential severe complications. While 65% of respondents were aware of the vaccine, only 15% had started the course of vaccination as of February 2019. Further, 43% of parents did not intend to vaccinate, most commonly due to lack of inclusion in the NIP, but also due to perception of mild disease. Nevertheless, if offered within the NIP, 85% of parents would be highly likely to vaccinate their child. A number of statistically significant differences in awareness and behaviours were observed between sociodemographic subgroups. In general, women were more aware of vaccination (72%) compared to men (58%). Among unemployed or respondents with elementary school education, awareness was below 43%, and among respondents with high income the awareness was above 75%. Similarly, among unemployed or respondents with a low income the vaccination rate was as low as 30% compared with at least 57% among respondents with a high income. Respondents from metropolitan areas, those with university degrees and respondents with a higher income were more likely to be aware of the varicella vaccine and to have vaccinated their child. Whilst inclusion in the NIP is clearly the main driver for uptake, these identified knowledge gaps should inform educational efforts to ensure that all parents are informed of the availability and benefits of the varicella vaccine independent of socioeconomic status.","['Arnheim-Dahlström L', 'Zarabi N', 'Hagen K', 'Bencina G']",2021,16,10,PLoS One,"Arnheim-Dahlström L, et al.

We analyzed features of varicella reported in Georgia to evaluate case detection through syndromic surveillance and to compare varicella reported through syndromic surveillance with varicella reported from all other sources.
METHODS: Syndromic surveillance was incorporated into case-based varicella surveillance by the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) in May 2016. A cross-sectional study design evaluated syndromic and nonsyndromic varicella reported to GDPH from May 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. Varicella was reported by nonsyndromic sources including health care providers, schools, and laboratories. We identified syndromic varicella cases from urgent care and emergency department visit data with discharge diagnoses containing the terms ""varicella"" or ""chickenpox.""
RESULTS: Syndromic notifications accounted for 589 of 2665 (22.1%) suspected varicella reports investigated by GDPH. The positive predictive value was 33.1% for syndromic notifications and 31.3% for nonsyndromic notifications. Mean days from rash onset to GDPH notification was 3.2 days fewer (
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Syndromic notifications were an effective, timely means for varicella case detection. Syndromic patients were significantly less likely than nonsyndromic patients to be outbreak-associated, possibly because of early detection. Syndromic surveillance enhanced case-based reporting for varicella in Georgia and was a useful tool to improve notifiable disease surveillance.","['Adam CM', 'Borroto R', 'Thomas E', 'Tuttle J', 'Pavlick J', 'Drenzek CL']",2022,137,6,Public Health Rep,"Adam CM, et al.

34634090,Common communicable diseases in the general population in France during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"In France, social distancing measures have been adopted to contain the spread of COVID-19, culminating in national Lockdowns. The use of hand washing, hydro-alcoholic rubs and mask-wearing also increased over time. As these measures are likely to impact the transmission of many communicable diseases, we studied the changes in common infectious diseases incidence in France during the first year of COVID-19 circulation. We examined the weekly incidence of acute gastroenteritis, chickenpox, acute respiratory infections and bronchiolitis reported in general practitioner networks since January 2016. We obtained search engine query volume for French terms related to these diseases and sales data for relevant drugs over the same period. A periodic regression model was fit to disease incidence, drug sales and search query volume before the COVID-19 period and extrapolated afterwards. We compared the expected values with observations made in 2020. During the first lockdown period, incidence dropped by 67% for gastroenteritis, by 79% for bronchiolitis, by 49% for acute respiratory infection and 90% for chickenpox compared to the past years. Reductions with respect to the expected incidence reflected the strength of implemented measures. Incidence in children was impacted the most. Reduction in primary care consultations dropped during a short period at the beginning of the first lockdown period but remained more than 95% of the expected value afterwards. In primary care, the large decrease in reported gastroenteritis, chickenpox or bronchiolitis observed during the period where many barrier measures were implemented imply that the circulation of common viruses was reduced and informs on the overall effect of these measures.","['Launay T', 'Souty C', 'Vilcu AM', 'Turbelin C', 'Blanchon T', 'Guerrisi C', 'Hanslik T', 'Colizza V', 'Bardoulat I', 'Lemaître M', 'Boëlle PY']",2021,16,10,PLoS One,"Launay T, et al.

34622421,An Analysis of Spontaneously Reported Data of Vesicular and Bullous Cutaneous Eruptions Occurring Following Vaccination with the Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine.,"INTRODUCTION: With the approval of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix, GSK) in October 2017, GSK established enhanced safety surveillance measures to allow prompt identification of potential safety signals not observed during clinical development. In Germany, cases of vesicular and bullous cutaneous eruptions following RZV vaccination were reported.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to search and analyse 2.5 years of worldwide spontaneously reported post-marketing data for vesicular and bullous cutaneous eruptions, represented by adverse events suggestive of (1) herpes zoster (HZ) and (2) non-HZ vesicular and bullous cutaneous eruptions, that occurred following RZV vaccination.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis of all identified reports of HZ and non-HZ vesicular and bullous cutaneous eruptions following RZV vaccination and an observed versus expected (O/E) analysis of reports of HZ that met criteria of varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivations following RZV vaccination (i.e., time to onset [TTO] of the event < 30 days or missing after any dose).
RESULTS: Until the data lock point, 32,597,779 RZV doses had been distributed globally. There were 2423 reports of HZ (including complications) identified, of which 645 met the criteria of possible vaccination failure (i.e., TTO of the event ≥ 30 days or missing following a complete RZV vaccination schedule). The O/E analysis of 1928 reports assessed as possible VZV reactivations indicated that the observed number of cases was lower than that expected in the general population. Additionally, 810 reports of non-HZ vesicular and bullous cutaneous eruptions were identified, including injection site rashes attributed to the vaccine's reactogenicity.
CONCLUSION: This review of spontaneously reported post-marketing data did not raise safety concerns regarding the occurrence of vesicular and bullous cutaneous eruptions following vaccination with RZV.","['Pirrotta P', 'Tavares-Da-Silva F', 'Co M', 'Lecrenier N', 'Hervé C', 'Stegmann JU']",2021,44,12,Drug Saf,"Pirrotta P, et al.

This study focuses on compliance of T1D patients to the recommended vaccination schedule, vaccination of their close contacts for influenza and on factors potentially contributing to vaccination program deviations.
METHODS: The study population comprised children, adolescents and adults with T1D under follow-up at the Department of Pediatrics University Hospital and the Diabetic Center General Hospital, Heraklion, Crete-Greece. Data were extracted, following informed consent, from individual's vaccination booklet, medical files and telephone interview. Vaccination records, demographic parameters, glycemic control and influenza vaccination of close contacts were assessed.
RESULTS: The study included 258 participants (111 children/adolescents, 147 adults). Vaccination coverage for influenza was 76.7% for children, 64.4% for adults, for PCV 90.9% for children, but only 10.8% for the 23-valent, for hepatitis B 99% for children and 78.2% for adults. Youngsters were vaccinated against Hib 91.9%, meningococcus C 98.2%, measles-mumps-rubella 90.3%, chickenpox 86.4%, hepatitis A 76.5% and HPV 42.5%. Less than 65% of all individuals were fully vaccinated for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and meningococcus ACWY. Approximately 50% of the 605 close contacts were not vaccinated against influenza. Individuals with better glycemic status seemed to adhere to the recommended schedule and had a better vaccinated family environment.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination coverage for T1D individuals was sufficient regarding the majority of routine childhood vaccines, but less for adolescence and group-specific vaccines. Their family contacts were not sufficiently vaccinated for influenza. Targeted interventions are required in order to increase vaccination rates.","['Giatraki V', 'Dimitriou H', 'Pappas A', 'Mamoulakis D', 'Makris G', 'Galanakis E', 'Perdikogianni C']",2021,17,11,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Giatraki V, et al.

34613868,Routine varicella vaccination program and hospitalization for herpes zoster in Japan.,"Whether reducing exposure to varicella by the implementation of the routine varicella vaccination program for children leads to increased incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to identify the trend in the hospitalization associated with HZ before and after the introduction of routine varicella vaccination by using nationally representative data from an inpatient database in Japan. Data were obtained on the number of inpatients hospitalized for HZ from the ""Survey on the effect of the introduction of Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database"" and the total population in Japan from the Population Estimates created by the former Statistics Bureau between fiscal years 2013 and 2018. The data from the DPC hospitals only and all hospitals in the survey were analyzed separately. The trends in the annual incidence of HZ hospitalization were identified. The trends in the annual hospitalization for HZ per 100,000 persons were then analyzed by age group (0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-79, and ≥80 years of age). The annual number of hospitalizations for HZ was approximately 20,000 in the DPC hospitals and 25,000 in all hospitals, showing no upward trend. The age-specific annual hospitalization rate for HZ did not increase in all the age groups. As age increased, the hospitalization rate also increased. This study presents no upward trend in the hospitalizations for HZ after the implementation of the routine varicella vaccination program in Japan.","['Kuniyoshi Y', 'Tokutake H', 'Takahashi N', 'Kamura A', 'Yasuda S', 'Tashiro M']",2021,17,11,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Kuniyoshi Y, et al.

From 2000, national and international patient registries were established to monitor biologic treatment, disease activity and adverse events in patients with JIA. The aim of this analysis was to investigate in parallel, for the first time, three of the largest JIA registries in Europe/internationally-UK JIA Biologic Registers (BCRD/BSPAR-ETN), German biologic registers (BiKeR/JuMBO), multinational Pharmachild-to quantify the occurrence of selected comorbidities in patients with JIA.
METHODS: Information on which data the registers collect were compared. Patient characteristics and levels of comorbidity were presented, focussing on four key conditions: uveitis, MAS, varicella, and history of tuberculosis. Incidence rates of these on MTX/biologic therapy were determined.
RESULTS: 8066 patients were registered into the three JIA registers with similar history of the four comorbidities across the studies; however, varicella vaccination coverage was higher in Germany (56%) vs UK/Pharmachild (16%/13%). At final follow-up, prevalence of varicella infection was lower in Germany (15%) vs UK/Pharmachild (37%/50%). Prevalence of TB (0.1-1.8%) and uveitis (15-19%) was similar across all registers. The proportion of systemic-JIA patients who ever had MAS was lower in Germany (6%) vs UK (15%) and Pharmachild (17%).
CONCLUSION: This analysis is the first and largest to investigate the occurrence of four important comorbidities in three JIA registries in Europe and the role of anti-rheumatic drugs. Combined, these three registries represent one of the biggest collection of cases of JIA worldwide and offer a unique setting for future JIA outcome studies.","['Kearsley-Fleet L', 'Klotsche J', 'van Straalen JW', 'Costello W', ""D'Angelo G"", 'Giancane G', 'Horneff G', 'Klein A', 'Láday M', 'Lunt M', 'de Roock S', 'Ruperto N', 'Schoemaker C', 'Vijatov-Djuric G', 'Vojinovic J', 'Vougiouka O', 'Wulffraat NM', 'UK JIA Biologics Registers Investigators Group; Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO)', 'Hyrich KL', 'Minden K', 'Swart JF']",2022,61,6,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Kearsley-Fleet L, et al.

34609490,No Consistent Evidence of Decreased Exposure to Varicella-Zoster Virus Among Older Adults in Countries with Universal Varicella Vaccination.,"BACKGROUND: Universal varicella vaccination might reduce opportunities for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) exposure and protective immunological boosting, thus increasing herpes zoster incidence in latently infected adults. We assessed humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI), as markers of VZV exposure, in adults aged ≥50 years.
METHODS: We repurposed data from placebo recipients in a large multinational clinical trial (ZOE-50). Countries were clustered based on their varicella vaccination program characteristics, as having high, moderate, or low VZV circulation. Anti-VZV antibody geometric mean concentrations, median frequencies of VZV-specific CD4 T cells, and percentages of individuals with increases in VZV-specific CD4 T-cell frequencies were compared across countries and clusters. Sensitivity analyses using a variable number of time points and different thresholds were performed for CMI data.
RESULTS: VZV-specific humoral immunity from 17 countries (12 high, 2 moderate, 3 low circulation) varied significantly between countries (P < .0001) but not by VZV circulation. No significant differences were identified in VZV-specific CMI between participants from 2 high versus 1 low circulation country. In 3/5 sensitivity analyses, increases in CMI were more frequent in high VZV circulation countries (.03 ≤ P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: We found no consistent evidence of reduced VZV exposure among older adults in countries with universal varicella vaccination.

34594078,Susceptibility of cadets and recruits to chickenpox: A seroprevalence study.,"BACKGROUND: Regular outbreaks of chickenpox are reported among cadets and recruits in the army undergoing training, resulting in morbidity and loss in terms of training days. Vaccination policy in the army mandates that all cadets and recruits be vaccinated against chickenpox on joining the training centers. However, 100% vaccination of trainees is not achieved. Hence, seroprevalence data among cadets and recruits were collected with the aim to assess the need for vaccination against chickenpox.
METHODS: The data were collected from cadets and recruits undergoing training in military training centers by simple random sampling. Blood samples were collected from all study participants for IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for varicella zoster. A structured questionnaire was also used to collect information from all participants.
RESULTS: A total of 2041 cadets and recruits between the ages of 19-29 years were studied of which 96.1% were males. Of all participants, 49.9% were seropositive showing varicella zoster virus (VZV) IgG antibody in the serum, and 29.1% study participants gave positive history of having had varicella in the past. The sensitivity of definite positive history of varicella when compared with presence of VZV IgG antibodies was found to be 55.50% while specificity was found to be 97.17%.
CONCLUSION: A very large majority of cadets and recruits that joined the army are susceptible to chickenpox. Hence, the risk of repeated chickenpox outbreaks in these training centers remains very high. As the sensitivity of history of past infection of chickenpox is relatively low, it cannot be used as a tool to determine the susceptibility of the trainees to the infection.","['Suryam V', 'Khera A', 'Patrikar S']",2021,77,4,Med J Armed Forces India,"Suryam V, et al.

34591738,Survey among Italian experts on existing vaccines' role in limiting antibiotic resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health problem threatening to reverse the progress made against infectious diseases. The rapid increase of AMR exposes Italian hospitals at increased risk of untreatable infections. Vaccinations can potentially limit AMR by reducing the number of infected cases in need of antibiotics. We conducted a survey among Italian vaccine experts to record their opinion regarding the role of vaccinations against antibiotic resistance (ABR). Among 80 invited experts, 51 answered all questions. Most respondents were experts in hygiene and preventive medicine (56.9%) and aged >50 years (72.6%). ABR was a priority concern in the daily professional activity of 82.4% of respondents. Overall, 47.1% of respondents believed that all vaccinations included in the vaccination calendar played a role against ABR: 92.2% for pertussis vaccination followed by 88.2%, 74.5%, and 70.6% for meningococcus, measles, and varicella vaccinations, respectively. Almost all respondents agreed that the role of vaccinations against ABR should be clearly expressed in the national vaccination guidelines (96.1%) and Scientific Societies should take an explicit position on the issue (92.2%). These results show that Italian experts have recognized the vaccinations' potential role in limiting ABR and guidelines from the appropriate scientific and governmental authorities are needed.","['Marchetti F', 'Prato R', 'Viale P']",2021,17,11,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Marchetti F, et al.

34590140,Live Attenuated Varicella Vaccine: Prevention of Varicella and of Zoster.,"Michiaki Takahashi developed the live attenuated varicella vaccine in 1974 . This was the first, and is still the only, herpesvirus vaccine. Early studies showed promise, but the vaccine was rigorously tested on immunosuppressed patients because of their high risk of fatal varicella; vaccination proved to be lifesaving. Subsequently, the vaccine was found to be safe and effective in healthy children. Eventually, varicella vaccine became a component of measles mumps rubella vaccine, 2 doses of which are administered in the USA to ~90% of children. The incidence of varicella has dropped dramatically in the USA since vaccine-licensure in 1995. Varicella vaccine is also associated with a decreased incidence of zoster and is protective for susceptible adults. Today, immunocompromised individuals are protected against varicella due to vaccine-induced herd immunity. Latent infection with varicella zoster virus occurs after vaccination; however, the vaccine strain is impaired for its ability to reactivate.","['Gershon AA', 'Gershon MD', 'Shapiro ED']",2021,224,12 Suppl 2,J Infect Dis,"Gershon AA, et al.

34561139,Safety surveillance of varicella vaccine using tree-temporal scan analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Passive surveillance systems are susceptible to the under-reporting of adverse events (AE) and a lack of information pertaining to vaccinated populations. Conventional active surveillance focuses on predefined AEs. Advanced data mining tools could be used to identify unusual clusters of potential AEs after vaccination.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a novel tree-based statistical approach to the identification of AE clustering following the implementation of a varicella vaccination program among one-year-olds.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide safety surveillance was based on data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database and National Immunization Information System for the period 2004 through 2014. The study population was children aged 12-35 months who received the varicella vaccine.
EXPOSURE: First-dose varicella vaccine.
OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All incident ICD-9-CM diagnoses (emergency or inpatient departments) occurring 1-56 days after the varicella vaccination were classified within a hierarchical system of diagnosis categories using Multi-Level Clinical Classifications Software. A self-controlled tree-temporal data mining tool was then used to explore the incidence of AE clustering with a variety of potential risk intervals. The comparison interval consisted of days in the 56-day follow-up period that fell outside the risk interval.
RESULTS: Among 1,194,189 varicella vaccinees with no other same-day vaccinations, nine diagnoses with clustering features were categorized into four safety signals: fever on days 1-6 (attributable risk [AR] 38.5 per 100,000, p < 0.001), gastritis and duodenitis on days 1-2 (AR 5.9 per 100,000, p < 0.001), acute upper respiratory infection on days 1-5 (AR 11.0 per 100,000, p = 0.006), and varicella infection on days 1-9 (AR 2.7 per 100,000, p < 0.001). These safety profiles and their corresponding risk intervals have been identified in previous safety surveillance studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Unexpected clusters of AEs were not detected after the mass administration of childhood varicella vaccines in Taiwan. The tree-temporal statistical method is a feasible approach to the safety surveillance of vaccines in populations of young children.","['Liu CH', 'Huang WT', 'Chie WC', 'Arnold Chan K']",2021,39,43,Vaccine,"Liu CH, et al.

34560893,Herpesvirus infections and Alzheimer's disease: a Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that herpesvirus infection increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear whether the association is causal. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the causal relationship between four herpesvirus infections and AD.
METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate association of four active herpesvirus infections with AD using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. The four herpesvirus infections (i.e., chickenpox, shingles, cold sores, mononucleosis) are caused by varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), respectively. A large summary statistics data from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project was used in primary analysis, including 21,982 AD cases and 41,944 controls. Validation was further performed using family history of AD data from UK Biobank (27,696 cases of maternal AD, 14,338 cases of paternal AD and 272,244 controls).
RESULTS: We found evidence of a significant association between mononucleosis (caused by EBV) and risk of AD after false discovery rates (FDR) correction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.634, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.092-2.446, P = 0.017, FDR-corrected P = 0.034). It has been verified in validation analysis that mononucleosis is also associated with family history of AD (OR [95% CI] = 1.392 [1.061, 1.826], P = 0.017). Genetically predicted shingles were associated with AD risk (OR [95% CI] = 0.867 [0.784, 0.958], P = 0.005, FDR-corrected P = 0.020), while genetically predicted chickenpox was suggestively associated with increased family history of AD (OR [95% CI] = 1.147 [1.007, 1.307], P = 0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided evidence supporting a positive relationship between mononucleosis and AD, indicating a causal link between EBV infection and AD. Further elucidations of this association and underlying mechanisms are likely to identify feasible interventions to promote AD prevention.","['Huang SY', 'Yang YX', 'Kuo K', 'Li HQ', 'Shen XN', 'Chen SD', 'Cui M', 'Tan L', 'Dong Q', 'Yu JT']",2021,13,1,Alzheimers Res Ther,"Huang SY, et al.

METHODS: Retrospective observational case report.
RESULTS: A 71-year-old gentleman presented to us with complaints of reduced vision associated with redness and pain in his right eye for 1 week. On examination he revealed a right eye pan uveitis picture with circumcorneal congestion, multiple fine keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells and flare, vitritis and widespread areas of acute retinal necrosis. His left eye was within normal limits. Ten days prior to the presentation he had received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine following which he had developed fever for 2 days that preceded the red eye. The patient's aqueous sample tested positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV) by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from the aqueous and also from the nasopharyngeal swab was negative.
CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge this is the earliest description of a case that has a viral reactivation following COVID-19 vaccination. Elderly people with pre-existing comorbidities, may be at a risk of both primary coronavirus infection and unconceivable risk of aberrant immune reactions leading to a different virus infection or reactivation need to be kept in mind.

34536279,Association Between Diabetes Mellitus and the Risk of Herpes Zoster: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"CONTEXT: Individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) are susceptible to various infections.
OBJECTIVE: We estimated the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) among individuals with DM compared with individuals in the general population.
METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PerioPath databases from their inception to January 30, 2021, for studies on the risk of HZ in individuals with DM. Two authors independently screened all articles identified. The same 2 authors independently extracted the data. Four case-control studies and 12 cohort studies were included.
RESULTS: Meta-analyses were performed using fixed and mixed-effects models. In the pooled analysis, individuals with DM had a higher risk of developing HZ (pooled relative risk [RR]: 1.38; 95% CI, 1.21-1.57) than individuals in the general population. The results were consistent in subgroup analyses stratified by type of diabetes, age, and study design. In individuals with DM, cardiovascular disease had an additive effect on increasing the risk of HZ (pooled RR: 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.28). There was a linear dose-response association between age and the risk of HZ in individuals with DM.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with DM have an increased risk of HZ compared with the general population. Varicella vaccination should be provided to individuals with DM regardless of their age, prioritizing older adults and those with cardiovascular disease. Varicella vaccination policies for individuals with DM should be updated based on the evidence.","['Huang CT', 'Lee CY', 'Sung HY', 'Liu SJ', 'Liang PC', 'Tsai MC']",2022,107,2,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,"Huang CT, et al.

34533095,Identification of novel potential inhibitors of varicella-zoster virus thymidine kinase from ethnopharmacologic relevant plants through an in-silico approach.,"Although Varicella or chickenpox infection which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) has significantly been managed through vaccination, it remains an infection that poses threats to the nearest future due to therapeutic drawbacks. The focus of this research was geared towards in silico screening for the identification of novel compounds in plants of ethnopharmacological relevance in the treatment of chicken pox in West Africa. The work evaluated 65 compounds reported to be present in Achillea millefolium, Psidium guajava and Vitex doniana sweet to identify potential inhibitors of thymidine kinase, the primary drug target of varicella zoster virus. Out of the 65 compounds docked, 42 of these compounds were observed to possess binding energies lower than -7.0 kcal/mol, however only 20 were observed to form hydrogen bond interactions with the protein. These interactions were elucidated using LigPlot+ and MM-PBSA analysis with residue Ala134 predicted as critical for binding. Pharmacological profiling predicted three potential lead compounds comprising myricetin, apigenin- 4' -glucoside and Abyssinone V to possess good pharmacodynamics properties and negligibly toxic. The molecules were predicted as antivirals including anti-herpes and involved in mechanisms comprising inhibition of polymerase, ATPase and membrane integrity, which were corroborated previously in other viruses. These drug-like compounds are plausible biotherapeutic moieties for further biochemical and cell-based assaying to discover their potential for use against chickenpox. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The study aimed to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of one-dose UVV by timeline and severity of the disease.
METHODS: All children born in Korea in 2011 were included for this retrospective cohort study that analyzed insurance claims data from 2011-2018 and the varicella vaccination records in the immunization registry. Adjusted hazard ratios by Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the VE through propensity score matching by the month of birth, sex, healthcare utilization rate, and region.
RESULTS: Of the total 421,070 newborns in the 2011 birth cohort, 13,360 were matched for age, sex, healthcare utilization rate, and region by the propensity score matching method. A total of 55,940 (13.29%) children were diagnosed with varicella, with the incidence rate 24.2 per 1000 person-year; 13.4% of vaccinated children and 10.4% of unvaccinated children. The VE of one-dose UVV against any varicella was 86.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.4-89.5) during the first year after vaccination and 49.9% (95% CI, 43.3-55.7) during the 6-year follow-up period since vaccination, resulting in a 7.2% annual decrease of VE. The overall VE for severe varicella was 66.3%. The VE of two-dose compared to one-dose was 73.4% (95% CI, 72.2-74.6).
CONCLUSION: We found lower long-term VE in one-dose vaccination and waning of effectiveness over time. Longer follow ups of the vaccinated children as well as appropriately designed studies are needed to establish the optimal strategy in preventing varicella in Korea.","['Hong K', 'Sohn S', 'Choe YJ', 'Rhie K', 'Lee JK', 'Han MS', 'Chun BC', 'Choi EH']",2021,36,36,J Korean Med Sci,"Hong K, et al.

34507860,"Impact of six years of routine varicella vaccination on the disease-related hospitalizations at Minas Gerais, Brazil.","INTRODUCTION: The varicella vaccine was first introduced into the Brazilian immunization schedule in September 2013 as a single dose for children aged 15 months. In 2018, a second dose was recommended for individuals between 4 and 6 years old. This study aims to assess the impact of routine varicella vaccination on the number and profile of hospitalized varicella patients during the single dose period, as well as in the first two years after the adoption of the second dose.
METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted in an infectious disease pediatric hospital, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Clinical as well as epidemiological data from patients hospitalized due to varicella between 2010 and 2019 were collected. Patients were split into groups based on the vaccine introduction: pre-vaccine period, single dose and two-dose period. They were compared by age, sex, reason for admission, illness-related complications and clinical outcome.
RESULTS: There were 1193 admissions due to varicella during the studied period. When compared with the pre-vaccine period, the number of hospitalizations decreased in 61.5% during the single-dose regime, reaching 95.2% in the two-dose period. Hospitalization rates decreased in all age groups, including non-vaccinated individuals such as those younger than 12 months (92.1%). As for reasons of admission, secondary bacterial skin infections were perceived to be the most common cause (>70%). A reduction was also seen in admission of immunocompromised or HIV positive patients (84.8%).
CONCLUSION: The collected data shows a significant impact in the number of hospital admissions due to varicella after six years of the implementation of the vaccine, positively affecting both vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. Further reduction was seen after the second dose was initiated, but its true impact will only be understood fully after a longer period of continuous vaccination.","['Abreu E Silva HB', 'Corrêa HP', 'Ribeiro IA', 'Nascimento VAM', 'Greco CM', 'Pinto ICT', 'Teixeira DC', 'Diniz LMO', 'Ribeiro JGL']",2022,40,2,Vaccine,"Abreu E Silva HB, et al.

Adults typically experience more severe symptoms than children and have a higher risk of developing complications. Stage 1 of this Phase 3 open-label study enrolled healthy adults in Russia aged 18-75 years without a clinical history of varicella infection. Eligible participants (n = 50) were administered 2 doses of VARIVAX™ (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live [Oka/Merck]) 0.5 mL 6 weeks apart. For participants seronegative at baseline (VZV antibody titer <1.25 glycoprotein enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay [gpELISA] units/mL), immunogenicity was assessed by seroconversion (VZV antibody titer ≥5 gpELISA units/mL) and assessment of geometric mean titers of VZV antibody as measured by gpELISA 6 weeks after Dose 2. For VZV seropositive participants at baseline (VZV antibody titer ≥1.25 gpELISA units/mL), immunogenicity was assessed by geometric mean fold rise in antibody titer and percentage of participants with a ≥ 4-fold rise in antibody titer 6 weeks after Dose 2. A Vaccine Report Card was used to record solicited and unsolicited adverse events through 42 days post-vaccination. All participants who were seronegative (n = 26) at baseline demonstrated seroconversion 6 weeks after Dose 2. Among participants who were seropositive at baseline (n = 23), 60.9% had a ≥4-fold rise in antibody titer 6 weeks after Dose 2.

34468169,Nectin-1 Is an Entry Mediator for Varicella-Zoster Virus Infection of Human Neurons.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) maintains lifelong latency in neurons following initial infection and can subsequently be reactivated to result in herpes zoster or severe neurological manifestations such as encephalitis. Mechanisms of VZV neuropathogenesis have been challenging to study due to the strict human tropism of the virus. Although neuronal entry mediators of other herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, have been identified, little is known regarding how VZV enters neurons. Here, we utilize a human stem cell-based neuronal model to characterize cellular factors that mediate entry. Through transcriptional profiling of infected cells, we identify the cell adhesion molecule nectin-1 as a candidate mediator of VZV entry. Nectin-1 is highly expressed in the cell bodies and axons of neurons. Either knockdown of endogenous nectin-1 or incubation with soluble forms of nectin-1 produced in mammalian cells results in a marked decrease in infectivity of neurons. Notably, while addition of soluble nectin-1 during viral infection inhibits infectivity, addition after infection has no effect on infectivity. Ectopic expression of human nectin-1 in a cell line resistant to productive VZV infection confers susceptibility to infection. In summary, we have identified nectin-1 as a neuronal entry mediator of VZV.

34452773,Live attenuated vaccine efficacy six months after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for Kawasaki disease.,"BACKGROUND: Due to the presence of maternal passive antibodies, the measles vaccine is ineffective if administered before age 12-15 months. The optimal timing for administering a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) for Kawasaki disease (KD) has not been fully investigated. The recommended interval between vaccination and IVIG therapy for KD differs by country. The present study aimed to evaluate efficacy of LAV six months after IVIG therapy for KD in Japan.
METHODS: The present, single-arm, prospective, interventional study included patients aged 6 months or older with no medical history of measles, rubella, varicella or mumps or vaccinations against these diseases. The subjects received these vaccinations for the first time at six months after IVIG therapy. Virus-specific IgG levels for each virus measured by EIA was examined at nine months after IVIG therapy. If the results were negative, the subjects received a booster vaccination at 12 months after IVIG therapy. The primary outcome was the prevalence of positivity for antibodies after the initial and booster vaccinations.
RESULTS: The present study enrolled 32 subjects, 31% of whom were female, with an average age of 10.8 (standard deviation 2.8) months at IVIG therapy. At six months after IVIG therapy, 9% and 6% of the subjects were seropositive for measles and varicella titers, respectively, but were seronegative for the mumps and rubella titers. The seroconversion rate for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella after the initial vaccination was 88%, 6%, 78%, and 16%, respectively. The seroconversion rate after a booster vaccination was 100% for measles and rubella, 97% for mumps, and 77% for varicella.
CONCLUSIONS: The seroconversion rate was low for LAV at six months after a single dose of IVIG for KD, but seroconversion was achievable with a booster vaccination at 12 months.

34388287,Influence of anti-coronavirus disease 2019 policies on 10 pediatric infectious diseases.,"BACKGROUND: To combat the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, many countries, including Japan, implemented policies limiting social activities and encouraging preventive behaviors. This study examines the influence of such policies on the trends of 10 infectious pediatric diseases: pharyngoconjunctival fever; group A streptococcal pharyngitis; infectious gastroenteritis; chickenpox; erythema infectiosum; hand, foot, and mouth disease; herpangina; respiratory syncytial virus; exanthem subitum; and mumps.
METHODS: The research adopted a retrospective cohort study design. We collected data from Japan's National Epidemiological Surveillance Program detailing the incidences of the 10 diseases per pediatric sentinel site for a period beginning at 9 weeks before government-ordered school closures and ending at 9 weeks after the end of the state of emergency. We obtained corresponding data for the equivalent weeks in 2015-2019. We estimated the influence of the policies using a difference-in-differences regression model.
RESULTS: For seven diseases (pharyngoconjunctival fever; group A streptococcal pharyngitis; infectious gastroenteritis; chickenpox; erythema infectiosum; hand, foot, and mouth disease; and herpangina), the incidence in 2020 decreased significantly during and after the school closures. Sensitivity analysis, in which the focus area was limited to the policy-implementation period or existing trend patterns, replicated these significant decreases for one of the above mentioned seven diseases - infectious gastroenteritis.
CONCLUSIONS: Policies such as school closures and encouragement of preventive behaviors were associated with significant decreases in the incidences of most of the 10 diseases, which sensitivity analysis replicated in infectious gastroenteritis.

We aimed to quantify the impact of the two-dose VarV on varicella incidence in Shanghai.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We directly extracted the data of varicella cases and VarV doses in 2013-2020 in Shanghai, and then estimated the effects of two-dose VarV using a Serfling model.
RESULTS: A two-dose VarV immunization program has been extensively implemented since October 2017 and become free since August 2018 in Shanghai. Before and after this program, varicella cases significantly declined in children (P < 0.01), whereas did not in adults aged >18 years (P = 0.22). Compared to the predicted number of varicella cases, actual number was significantly lower by 8% in 2018 and 28% in 2019. Among children aged 4-6 years, the reduction in varicella cases was largest. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in varicella cases throughout 2020 (P < 0.001), in which the decrease due to social distancing for the COVID-19 was 54%.

No guidelines are available for the medical and neurosurgical management of this condition. We report the first pediatric case with headache and PVA who was treated with surgical revascularization before the onset of ischemic events.
METHODS: This case report was conducted via retrospective chart review. A literature review was also completed, in order to identify previously described PVA undergone to revascularization.
RESULTS: We report on a 9-year-old boy presenting with a long history of headache and PVA involving the distal left middle cerebral artery. The arterial lesion rapidly worsened over a 10 months' period with formation of focal moyamoya-like collaterals, despite an adequate intravenous antiviral treatment. The pattern of headaches significantly changed with a clear left-side lateralization and a ""re-build-up"" phenomenon on EEG. The patient was treated with left superficial temporal artery - middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass and encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-pericranial-synangiosis. This combined treatment resulted in an immediate and persistent improvement of brain perfusion, accompanied by prompt resolution of neurological symptoms. Two cases who presented with Suzuki stage III (unilateral or bilateral) moyamoya PVA and recurrent strokes or transient ischemic attacks despite adequate pharmacological prophylaxis have been surgically treated using both indirect and direct revascularization technique. The outcome was good in both cases.
CONCLUSION: Surgical revascularization may have a role in the treatment of PVA and may prevent stroke. Given the lack of standardized treatment algorithms, individualized regimens should be formulated on a case-specific basis.","['Iodice A', 'Signa S', 'Severino M', 'Tortora D', 'Zanetti A', 'Amico G', 'Piatelli G', 'Bertamino M', 'Pavanello M']",2021,43,10,Brain Dev,"Iodice A, et al.

34324244,Immunogenicity of varicella zoster vaccine in pediatric liver transplantation.,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric liver transplant (LT) candidates often miss complete varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination before LT. We aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of two doses of VZV vaccines in pediatric LT candidates younger than 2 years and persistence of its immunogenicity after LT.
METHODS: Patients aged 9-24 months were enrolled before LT. The first dose of VZV vaccine was given at 9 months, and the second dose was given at between 1 to 3 months later, and at least 4 weeks before LT. Varicella-zoster IgG (VZG) was used to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies to VZV and was reported as a test value (TV). A test value ≥ 0.9 was considered as seropositive. TV was measured at enrollment, 1 month after the first and the second dose of VZV vaccine, before LT, and 3 and 6 months after LT.
RESULTS: Fourteen children were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. The median age at the first and the second dose of VZV vaccine was 11.5 months (IQR 9-12) and 13 months (IQR 12-33), respectively. The seroconversion rate was 66.7% (8/12) and 70% (7/10) after the first and second VZV vaccine doses, respectively. Seven of nine patients who underwent LT had two doses of VZV vaccine. Six patients were seropositive before LT, which persisted at 3 to 6 months after LT. Of two patients who received only one dose, TV was not detected after LT.

We conducted a review of available national guidelines or recommendations on RZV use to identify the similarities and differences and highlight any potential gaps.
AREAS COVERED: National recommendations from ten countries (Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA) are summarized under the following seven topics: HZ vaccine preference, age group recommendations, considerations prior to vaccination, dose schedule, co-administration with other vaccines, vaccination of special populations, and vaccine safety profile. In seven of these countries, RZV is the preferred or the only recommended HZ vaccine. There were some differences in age group recommendations, reflecting evaluations dependent on public funding. There were also differences with respect to use in immunocompromised and other special populations.
EXPERT OPINION: The high efficacy and anticipated public health impact of RZV led to expanded national recommendations for RZV vaccination compared to previous HZ recommendation in many countries. Possible areas that could be considered in future revisions of national recommendations, including use in immunocompromised adults ≥18 years, are also highlighted.","['Parikh R', 'Widenmaier R', 'Lecrenier N']",2021,20,9,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Parikh R, et al.

Seasonality, geographic distribution, severity, complications, risk factors, use of diagnostic and treatment procedures and hospitalization costs were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 5120 hospitalizations were registered, with an annual rate of 17.3 hospitalizations per 100 000 inhabitants. A higher number of hospitalizations occurred during the summer period and in Southern regions. The median length of stay was of 4 days (interquartile range: 3.0-7.0). We found a high rate of severe complications, mostly dermatologic (19.6%), neurologic (6.0%), and respiratory (5.1%). Of the total number of patients, 0.8% were immunocompromised and 0.1% were pregnant. Total direct hospitalization costs during the 16-year period were estimated to be 7 110 719€ (8 603 970 USD), with a mean annual cost of 444 419.92€ (537 748.10 USD).
CONCULSIONS: This is the first national study in which useful epidemiological data to evaluate the burden and impact of varicella in Portugal is provided.","['Fontoura-Matias J', 'Moreira RS', 'Reis-Melo A', 'Freitas A', 'Azevedo I']",2021,11,8,Hosp Pediatr,"Fontoura-Matias J, et al.

34261848,Infectious disease activity during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan: Lessons learned from prevention and control measures.,"In Japan, the Law Concerning the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (the ""Infectious Diseases Control Law"") classifies infectious diseases as category I-V infectious diseases, pandemic influenza, and designated infectious diseases based on their infectivity, severity, and impact on public health. COVID-19 was designated as a designated infectious disease as of February 1, 2020 and then classified under pandemic influenza as of February 13, 2021. According to national reports from sentinel surveillance, some infectious diseases transmitted by droplets, contact, or orally declined during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. As of week 22 (June 6, 2021), there were 704 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 8,144 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 356 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 45 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis; these numbers were significantly lower than those last year, with 563,487 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 31,785 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 3,518 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 250 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Similarly, many infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact declined in other countries and areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. One can reasonably assume that various measures adopted to control the transmission of COVID-19 have played a role in reducing the spread of other infectious diseases, and especially those transmitted by droplets or contact. Extensive and thorough implementation of personal protective measures and behavioral changes may serve as a valuable reference when identifying ways to reduce the spread of infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact in the future.","['Sawakami T', 'Karako K', 'Song P', 'Sugiura W', 'Kokudo N']",2021,15,4,Biosci Trends,"Sawakami T, et al.

34246455,[Cutaneous complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].,"BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell allograft is a treatment for patients with severe constitutional or acquired hematopoietic system diseases. This act is always linked to complications requiring multidisciplinary care. Our study describes the post-allograft cutaneous complications.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at the Hematology department of ""20 Août Hospital"" in Casablanca during a period going from January 2018 to December 2020; including all patients who presented acute or chronic cutaneous complications post-allograft.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included. All patients received induction chemotherapy (Busulfan/Fludarabine or Busulfan/Melphalan). A skin infection was found in 8 patients : four cases of Malassezia folliculitis, one case of perineal zona, one case of genital herpes, one case of varicella and one case of Candida sepsis. The acute graft versus host reaction was found in 3 patients, revealed by an erythematous rash all over the body. The chronic graft versus host reaction was found in five patients on a lichenoid form. Nine patients had a hyperpigmentation of the folds followed by detachment in the same areas, concluding to a Busulfan toxidermy.
DISCUSSION: Hematopoietic stem cell allograft has many complications. The literature mainly specifies hematological and digestive complications, while skin complications are little described. Our series is special by reporting different types and mechanisms of skin complications that can occur; with a predominance of skin graft-on-host reactions and infections. It also reports an unusual Busulfan toxidermy.","['Araqi Houssaini L', 'Hali F', 'Quessar A', 'Marnissi F', 'Chiheb S']",2021,108,9,Bull Cancer,"Araqi Houssaini L, et al.

34237090,Clinical and economic impact of universal varicella vaccination in Norway: A modeling study.,"BACKGROUND: Norway has not implemented universal varicella vaccination, despite the considerable clinical and economic burden of varicella disease.
METHODS: An existing dynamic transmission model of varicella infection was calibrated to age-specific seroprevalence rates in Norway. Six two-dose vaccination strategies were considered, consisting of combinations of two formulations each of a monovalent varicella vaccine (Varivax® or Varilrix®) and a quadrivalent vaccine against measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (ProQuad® or PriorixTetra®), with the first dose given with a monovalent vaccine at age 15 months, and the second dose with either a monovalent or quadrivalent vaccine at either 18 months, 7 or 11 years. Costs were considered from the perspectives of both the health care system and society. Quality-adjusted life-years saved and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios relative to no vaccination were calculated. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of vaccine efficacy, price, the costs of a lost workday and of inpatient and outpatient care, vaccination coverage, and discount rate.
RESULTS: In the absence of varicella vaccination, the annual incidence of natural varicella is estimated to be 1,359 per 100,000 population, and the cumulative numbers of varicella outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over 50 years are projected to be 1.81 million, 10,161, and 61, respectively. Universal varicella vaccination is projected to reduce the natural varicella incidence rate to 48-59 per 100,000 population, depending on the vaccination strategy, and to reduce varicella outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by 75-85%, 67-79%, and 75-79%, respectively. All strategies were cost-saving, with the most cost-saving as two doses of Varivax® at 15 months and 7 years (payer perspective) and two doses of Varivax® at 15 months and 18 months (societal perspective).
CONCLUSIONS: All modeled two-dose varicella vaccination strategies are projected to lead to substantial reductions in varicella disease and to be cost saving compared to no vaccination in Norway.","['Pawaskar M', 'Burgess C', 'Pillsbury M', 'Wisløff T', 'Flem E']",2021,16,7,PLoS One,"Pawaskar M, et al.

34224015,Common Features Between Stroke Following Varicella in Children and Stroke Following Herpes Zoster in Adults : Varicella-Zoster Virus in Trigeminal Ganglion.,"The cerebral arteries are innervated by afferent fibers from the trigeminal ganglia. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) frequently resides in the trigeminal ganglion. Reports of arterial ischemic stroke due to VZV cerebral vasculopathy in adults after herpes zoster have been described for decades. Reports of arterial ischemic stroke due to post-varicella cerebral arteriopathy in children have also been described for decades. One rationale for this review has been post-licensure studies that have shown an apparent protective effect from stroke in both adults who have received live zoster vaccine and children who have received live varicella vaccine. In this review, we define common features between stroke following varicella in children and stroke following herpes zoster in adults. The trigeminal ganglion and to a lesser extent the superior cervical ganglion are central to the stroke pathogenesis pathway because afferent fibers from these two ganglia provide the circuitry by which the virus can travel to the anterior and posterior circulations of the brain. Based on studies in pseudorabies virus (PRV) models, it is likely that VZV is carried to the cerebral arteries on a kinesin motor via gE, gI and the homolog of PRV US9. The gE product is an essential VZV protein.","['Grose C', 'Shaban A', 'Fullerton HJ']",2023,438,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Grose C, et al.

A ten-year follow-up from a randomized study in varicella-endemic countries.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections cause a substantial disease burden, which is underestimated due to incomplete reporting data and lack of serological surveillance. In this post-hoc analysis of a randomized, Phase IIIb clinical trial (NCT00226499) with a ten-year follow-up period, we report anti-VZV antibody levels and persistence in non-vaccinated children, as a varicella infection estimate in ten European countries with endemic varicella. The present analysis specifically focuses on clinical and serological data from the control group, which included 827 healthy participants aged 12-22 months who received two doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The per-protocol cohort included 744 children for whom varicella occurrence was evaluated by clinical definitions, epidemiological links and PCR test outcomes. Anti-VZV antibody levels were assessed by ELISA. The primary objective of this analysis was to correlate varicella occurrence with anti-VZV antibody levels. Varicella was confirmed in 47% of MMR recipients. Among participants without reported varicella, the percentage of anti-VZV seropositive children increased to 75% and average anti-VZV antibody concentrations increased to 250 mIU/mL at year ten after vaccination, suggesting infection or exposure. An eight-fold increase in anti-VZV antibody concentrations between two consecutive visits, which is also observed after confirmed varicella, was detected in 37% of these participants during the follow-up period. About one-third of children not vaccinated against varicella and not diagnosed with varicella developed an anti-VZV immune response, suggesting subclinical varicella occurrence.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using population-based administrative health data for children born between 1993 and 2018 (n = 924,124). We calculated age-specific cumulative HZ incidence rates by vaccination status for cohorts born before (1993-1999) and after (2000-2018) programme implementation; results were used to calculate relative risk of HZ by age group, vaccination status and vaccine availability period. Annual HZ incidence rates were calculated for 1993-2018. HZ risk was higher among unvaccinated children compared to vaccinated children across age groups; 64% higher before universal vaccination (RR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.39), and 32% higher after universal vaccination (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.73). Among unvaccinated children, HZ risk was 60% lower after vaccine programme implementation (RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.43). Two-dose receipt corresponded with a 41% lower risk of HZ compared to one-dose receipt (RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.65). Crude annual HZ incidence rates declined 64% after programme implementation, with decreases observed across age groups. Universal varicella vaccination programme implementation corresponds to decreased paediatric HZ incidence across age groups, in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.

34157417,"Immunogenicity and safety of a live attenuated varicella vaccine in children 1-12 years of age: A randomized, blinded, controlled, non-inferiority phase 3 clinical trial.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a live attenuated varicella vaccine produced using a cell factory process.
METHODS: In this randomized, blinded, controlled, non-inferiority phase 3 clinical trial conducted in Guizhou, healthy children aged 1-12 years were randomly assigned in a 2: 1 ratio to receive one dose of experimental or control vaccine. Physical examination and first blood collection were performed preimmunization on day 0. Diary cards were collected after day 15. Contact cards and second blood samples were collected on day 30. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the positive conversion rate of the anti-varicella virus antibody at 30 days postimmunization in susceptible children. Secondary endpoints were the fourfold increase rate, positive conversion rate, geometric mean titer, and geometric mean increase at 30 days after immunization in the total cohort.
RESULTS: Of the 900 children assessed for eligibility, 894 received an experimental or control vaccine. Both the full analysis and safety analysis sets included 894 subjects. The seroconversion rate in the susceptible population was 95.84% in the experimental and 94.76% in the control group. The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval difference was -2.37%, which was greater than the non-inferiority margin set by the program (-10%). No significant difference in solicited adverse reactions was found between the groups. Within 6 months postimmunization, a total of 24 serious adverse events were reported, none related to the studied vaccine.
CONCLUSION: The live attenuated varicella vaccine produced using a cell factory process was highly immunogenic, safe, and non-inferior to the product in the market.

34145665,Live virus vaccination of pediatric solid organ transplant candidates within 1 month prior to transplantation: A multicenter experience.,"BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable illness due to the high degree of immunosuppression required following transplantation. The current recommendation is to vaccinate with live attenuated vaccines, including Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) and Varicella (VAR) vaccines, at least 4 weeks prior to transplant. However, data to support the time interval between vaccine and transplant are limited.
METHODS: We conduct a literature review of the natural history of the viruses and length of viremia following live-attenuated viral vaccines, and we describe a series of 5 cases from 2 pediatric transplant centers in which live attenuated viral vaccines were administered within 21 days prior to SOT.
RESULTS: None of the 5 children who received MMR or VAR 8-21 days prior to liver (2) and heart (3) transplant suffered from vaccine-related viral illness after transplant, even in the presence of significant immunosuppression with T-cell-depleting agents.
CONCLUSION: These cases support that shorter intervals of live vaccine administration prior to transplant may be safe, allowing the vaccination of a larger cohort of SOT candidates. Increasing pretransplant vaccinations is crucial since, in most cases, live viral vaccines are contraindicated posttransplantation, and the most effective vaccine approaches utilize prime-boost strategies, priming before and boosting after transplant.","['Rosenthal A', 'Madigan T', 'Chen SF', 'Gans H', 'Nadimpalli S']",2021,23,4,Transpl Infect Dis,"Rosenthal A, et al.

34120389,Lack of persisting antibody in a post-transplant patient after vaccine-strain varicella.,"BACKGROUND: LAVV have historically been avoided in children after solid organ transplantation. However, it has been reported that post-transplant, children without severe immunosuppression can generate anti-varicella antibody after immunization but the duration of the response is not clear. Furthermore, the origin of the varicella virus in immunosuppressed patients who develop varicella after vaccination is often unclear.
CLINICAL PROGRESS: A female child received LAVV 30 months after a living donor liver transplant at the age of 2 months. Varicella rash appeared on the trunk 16 days after vaccination and gradually spread over the body. The patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir followed by oral therapy and recovered fully. The virus detected in blisters was derived from the vaccine-type strain. Paired sera before and after the onset of varicella showed an increase in antibody titer. However, 2 years after onset, the antibody titer decreased to undetectable again.
CONCLUSIONS: This was an informative case of varicella due to vaccine strain attenuated virus. Antibody levels were not maintained over many years. Although varicella was caused by the vaccine-type strain, repeated vaccinations may be necessary for post-transplant patients who develop varicella.","['Tamura D', 'Kurosaki M', 'Shinjoh M', 'Nishimura H', 'Yamagishi H', 'Yamagata T']",2021,25,7,Pediatr Transplant,"Tamura D, et al.

34115324,Safety Profile of the Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine in Immunocompromised Populations: An Overview of Six Trials.,"INTRODUCTION: The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) has demonstrated high efficacy against herpes zoster in older adults and immunocompromised populations. We present comprehensive safety data from six clinical trials in immunocompromised populations (autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant and renal transplant recipients, patients with hematologic malignancies, patients with solid tumors, and human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults) who are at an increased risk of herpes zoster.
METHODS: In all trials, immunocompromised adults ≥ 18 years of age were administered RZV or placebo. Safety was evaluated in the total vaccinated cohort. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for 7 days and unsolicited AEs for 30 days after each dose. Serious AEs, fatal serious AEs, and potential immune-mediated diseases were collected from dose 1 until 12 months post-last dose or study end. Data were pooled for solicited AEs; unsolicited AEs, (fatal) serious AEs, and potential immune-mediated diseases were analyzed for each individual trial. All AEs were analyzed for sub-strata of adults 18-49 years of age and ≥ 50 years of age.
RESULTS: In total, 1587 (RZV) and 1529 (placebo) adults were included in the pooled total vaccinated cohort. Solicited AEs were more common after RZV than placebo, were generally more common in the younger age stratum, and were mostly mild to moderate and resolved within 3 days (median duration). Unsolicited AEs and serious AEs were in line with underlying diseases and therapies. Across studies, the percentage of adults reporting one or more unsolicited AE was comparable between RZV and placebo, irrespective of age stratum. The percentage of adults reporting one or more serious AE, fatal serious AE, or potential immune-mediated diseases was generally similar for RZV and placebo, irrespective of age stratum. Overall, no safety concerns were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant zoster vaccine has a clinically acceptable safety profile. With the previously published vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity results, these data support a favorable benefit-risk profile of RZV vaccination in immunocompromised populations who are at an increased risk of herpes zoster.","['López-Fauqued M', 'Co-van der Mee M', 'Bastidas A', 'Beukelaers P', 'Dagnew AF', 'Fernandez Garcia JJ', 'Schuind A', 'Tavares-da-Silva F']",2021,44,7,Drug Saf,"López-Fauqued M, et al.

34107891,Two-dose varicella vaccine effectiveness in China: a meta-analysis and evidence quality assessment.,"BACKGROUND: The objectives of this review were to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the two-dose varicella vaccine for healthy children in China and explore the application of the approach of Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) in observational studies on VE.
METHODS: We searched for observational studies on two-dose varicella VE for children in China aged 1-12 years that were published from 1997 to 2019, and assessed the quality of each study using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). We used meta-analysis models to obtain the pooled two-dose VE, and the studies were divided into subgroups and analysed according to whether or not it was an outbreak investigation and its NOS score. The quality of evidence of VEs were rated by approach of the GRADE system.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies and 87,196 individuals were included. The pooled two-dose VE was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 69-97%). The VE of outbreak studies (87% [95% CI: 76-93%]) was lower than non-outbreak studies (99% [95% CI: 98-99%]). There was no significant difference in VEs by different NOS quality. The quality of the evidence assessment of pooled two-dose VE was ""low"", which was rated down by one category in limitations and publication bias respectively and rated up by two category in large effect. The quality of evidence assessment in subgroup of NOS score ≥ 7 was ""moderate"".
CONCLUSIONS: The VE of two-dose varicella vaccine is relatively high in preventing varicella, and is recommended for countries which need further control for varicella. However, higher quality evidence is needed as a supplement for stronger recommendations. The approach of GRADE could be applied for rating the quality of evidence in observational study.","['Zhang Z', 'Suo L', 'Pan J', 'Zhao D', 'Lu L']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Zhang Z, et al.

34101817,"Safety of measles, rubella and mumps vaccines in adults: a prospective cohort study.","BACKGROUND: In recent years, multiple outbreaks of measles associated with vaccine hesitancy occurred in high-income countries, where measles incidence had previously been low. Most safety data about the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine are derived from studies conducted among children, whereas evidence regarding the safety profile of the vaccine in adults is scarce.
METHODS: In 2017, during an outbreak of measles in Europe, Israeli travellers to high-risk locations who were incompletely vaccinated, were urged to complete the two MMR vaccination schedule before their travel. In this prospective cohort study, we analysed adverse events (AEs) of MMR and MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) vaccines among these travellers. All participants were followed up using structured questionnaires 2-4 weeks after vaccination.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and eighty-five adult travellers whose median age was 49.2 years were vaccinated and followed up. Any AEs were reported by 25.2% of all participants; 11.6% reported local AEs, and 18.6% reported systemic AEs, none of which were severe. In general, AEs were much more common among female travellers (19.4% of males vs 30.1% of females (P < 0.001)). Local AEs, overall systemic AEs, headache and arthralgia were much more common among females, whereas rates of general malaise and fever were not statistically different between genders. We did not observe any significant differences in the rates of total, local or systemic AEs between the MMR and MMRV vaccines. Higher rates of systemic AEs were observed among participants who were younger and probably immunized once with MMR compared to older vaccines immunized once to measles only and to those who were never immunized.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated low rates of systemic AEs and no serious AEs following either MMR or MMRV administration. More AEs were reported among females, and rates of AEs were similar after either MMR or MMRV.","['Ami N', 'Eyal N', 'Asaf B', 'Chen A', 'Adi B', 'Drorit A', 'Neta P', 'Hajar D', 'Stav R', 'Eli S']",2021,28,8,J Travel Med,"Ami N, et al.

Among the most common defects, we recognize Deciduous Molar Hypominerlization (DMH), Hypomineralized Second Primary Molar (HSPM), and Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH). These, in fact, affect the first deciduous molars, the second deciduous molars and molars, and permanent incisors, respectively, but their etiology remains unclear. The objective of the paper is to review studies that focus on investigating possible associations between genetic factors or prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal causes and these enamel defects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive and bibliometric search for publications until January 2021 was conducted. The research question was formulated following the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome strategy. Case-control, cross-sectional, cohort studies, and clinical trials investigating genetic and environmental etiological factors of enamel defects were included.
RESULTS: Twenty-five articles are included. For genetic factors, there is a statistical relevance for SNPs expressed in the secretion or maturation stage of amelogenesis (16% of studies and 80% of studies that investigated these factors). For prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal causes, there is a statistical relevance for postnatal factors, such as the breastfeeding period (2%), asthma (16%), high fever episodes (20%), infections/illnesses (20%), chickenpox (12%), antibiotic intake (8%), diarrhea (4%), and pneumonia (4%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results are in agreement with the multifactorial idea of the dental enamel defects etiology, but to prove this, further studies enrolling larger, well-diagnosed, and different ethnic populations are necessary to expand the investigation of the genetic and environmental factors that might influence the occurrence of DMH, HPSM, and MIH.","['Butera A', 'Maiorani C', 'Morandini A', 'Simonini M', 'Morittu S', 'Barbieri S', 'Bruni A', 'Sinesi A', 'Ricci M', 'Trombini J', 'Aina E', 'Piloni D', 'Fusaro B', 'Colnaghi A', 'Pepe E', 'Cimarossa R', 'Scribante A']",2021,8,6,Children (Basel),"Butera A, et al.

34046727,Expanding the clinical and neuroimaging features of post-varicella arteriopathy of childhood.,"OBJECTIVE: Post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is considered an uncommon cause of pediatric stroke that is considered a self-limiting, monophasic disease. However, in a subset of patients, disease recurs; the prevalence of vasculopathy or AIS recurrence, severity of clinical outcomes, and standardized therapies have not been well characterized. Herein, we determined the clinical-neuroradiological features, long-term evolution, and relationship between acute phase treatment and vasculopathy recurrence in a pediatric population with post-varicella AIS.
METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiological features of 22 children with post-varicella AIS between 2010 and 2019 (16 males, mean age at stroke 4 years, range 1.7-10) were reviewed. Statistical analyses were performed using χ
RESULTS: Of the 22 cases, mean time from varicella to stroke was 4.5 months with 3 cases presenting more than 12 months after rash; 21 (95%) were not vaccinated for varicella; 3 (13.6%) had posterior circulation involvement; and 5 (22.7%) had AIS or vasculopathy recurrence, of which 4 recurred 6.1 months to 2.8 years after initial clinical onset. Recurrence was associated with lack of antiviral treatment during the first episode (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Post-varicella AIS can occur months after rash making diagnosis challenging. Because recurrent vasculopathy was seen predominantly in cases not treated with antiviral therapy during initial presentation, it is important to rapidly diagnose post-varicella AIS through clinical criteria and/or virological testing then treat with antivirals to prevent recurrence.","['Bertamino M', 'Signa S', 'Veneruso M', 'Prato G', 'Caorsi R', 'Losurdo G', 'Teutonico F', 'Esposito S', 'Formica F', 'Tovaglieri N', 'Nagel MA', 'Amico G', 'Zanetti A', 'Tortora D', 'Rossi A', 'Moretti P', 'Gattorno M', 'Ravelli A', 'Severino M', 'in behalf of Gaslini Stroke Study Group']",2021,268,12,J Neurol,"Bertamino M, et al.

34035968,Varicella-Zoster Meningitis in an Immunocompetent Male without Fever or Rash.,"Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpesvirus that primarily causes chickenpox and can reactivate later in life. Chickenpox occurs mostly in children and is characterized by a typical generalized vesicular rash. Following the primary infection, VZV can remain latent and can reactivate decades later to produce Zoster, being more common in the elderly as well as immunosuppressed individuals. The diagnosis of both the primary and reactivation is mostly clinical from the typical rash. However, when presentations are atypical, it leads to diagnostic challenges. We report an unusual case of VZ reactivation in an immunocompetent young adult presenting without fever, zoster rash, or neuralgia. The diagnosis was established by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on cerebrospinal fluid samples. The patient was treated with acyclovir and responded very well. The diagnosis of VZ meningitis is challenging in the absence of typical features of Zoster rash and requires a high index of suspicion.","['Raghunathan R', 'Khalil Q', 'Mooty M']",2021,2021,,Case Rep Infect Dis,"Raghunathan R, et al.

34034659,Long -term persistence of antibodies against varicella in fully immunized healthcare workers: an Italian retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), and in infants, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised it can be serious. The best way to prevent chickenpox is immunization with the varicella vaccine. Protective levels of antibodies induced by the varicella vaccine decline over time, but there is currently no formal recommendation for testing anti-varicella zoster virus (VZV) IgG levels in immunized healthcare workers (HCWs).
METHODS: The aims of this study were to evaluate the seroprevalence of circulating anti-VZV IgG in a sample a sample of students and residents of the medical school of the University of Bari, the long-term immunogenicity of the varicella vaccine, and the effectiveness of a strategy consisting of a third vaccine booster dose. The study population was screened as part of a biological risk assessment conducted between April 2014 and October 2020. A strategy for the management of non-responders was also examined.
RESULTS: The 182 students and residents included in the study had a documented history of immunization (two doses of varicella vaccine). The absence of anti-VZV IgG was determined in 34% (62/182; 95%CI = 27.2-41.4%), with serosusceptibility more common among males than females (p < 0.05). After a third varicella dose, seroconversion was achieved in 100% of this previously seronegative group. No serious adverse events were recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: One-third of the study population immunized against VZV lacked a protective antibody titer, but a third dose of vaccine restored protection. Since it is highly unlikely that VZV will be eliminated in the immediate future, the loss of immunity in a substantial portion of the population implies a risk of varicella outbreaks in the coming years. Screening for varicella immunity in routine assessments of the biological risk of medical students and HCWs may help to prevent nosocomial VZV infections.","['Bianchi FP', 'Tafuri S', 'Larocca AMV', 'Germinario CA', 'Stefanizzi P']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Bianchi FP, et al.

34031954,Effect of the varicella vaccination implementation on the development of herpes zoster in children and adolescents.,"Herpes zoster (HZ) is an infectious disease caused by latent varicella-zoster virus reactivation. There are conflicting reports on the varicella vaccine's effect on the incidence of HZ in children and adolescents. This study aimed to determine the impact of the single dose of varicella vaccination on HZ prevalence during childhood and adolescence. The study included children and adolescents aged <18 years who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinic between 2005 and 2019 and were diagnosed with HZ. Considering that the universal vaccination program started to be implemented in Turkey in 2013, non-vaccinated cases in the prevaccination period, vaccinated cases in the postvaccination period, and non-vaccinated patients in the postvaccination period were compared in terms of HZ prevalence and demographic features. After the initiation of the varicella vaccination program, the prevalence of HZ was found to decrease by 24.7% in all. The HZ prevalence was significantly reduced in vaccinated children, while the rate of decrease in non-vaccinated children was low (58.6% and 16.4%, respectively). The median age of the non-vaccinated cases in the postvaccination period (10 [min 0.5-max 17] years) was significantly higher compared to the other groups (p < 0.001). The number of cases aged <2 years was the highest in the vaccinated group (p < 0.001). Administration of a single dose of varicella vaccine was insufficient to decrease the prevalence of HZ <18 years of age. In the post-vaccination period, the frequency of HZ in unvaccinated cases increased in adolescence. In vaccinated children, HZ seems to develop at an earlier age.","['Inan Yuksel E', 'Kara Polat A', 'Gore Karaali M', 'Koku Aksu AE', 'Gurel MS']",2021,34,4,Dermatol Ther,"Inan Yuksel E, et al.

34017771,Knowledge and attitude about cervical cancer and human papillomavirus vaccine among medical and paramedical students of a university.,"BACKGROUND: Every year, globally 570,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer, out of which around 311,000 die. India contributes to about 132,000 new cases and 74,000 deaths yearly. One of the major risk factors for cervical cancer is infection with some types of human papillomavirus (HPV). This is both preventable (by vaccination) and detectable early (routine screening programs).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the knowledge and attitude in medical and paramedical students about cervical cancer and HPV vaccination.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted, using predesigned and validated questionnaire. It was segregated into three parts: Q1-demographic details, Q2a-questions assessing knowledge, Q2b-questions assessing attitude. Our target population was female students (18-25 years) studying in medical, nursing, and physiotherapy colleges. Descriptive statistics of data was analyzed using SPSS 16.0.
RESULTS: We had 73% response rate. Most participants belonged to upper middle and upper socioeconomic class, were pursuing MBBS, resided in villages, had educated parents, and had good health-care-seeking behavior. School education, television, and printed advertisements appeared to be underutilized. Around 50% of the participant had received chickenpox and typhoid vaccine, but only 8% had received HPV vaccine. The mean knowledge score was 5.19 ± 2.24, with 0.00 minimum and 11.0 maximum, out of a maximum possible score of 17. Only, place of residence appeared to effect the knowledge score.
CONCLUSION: The study shows the dismal knowledge levels about HPV amongst students. Participants were interested in seeking knowledge; consider HPV vaccination provided they were provided with sufficient knowledge.","['Patel IS', 'Dongara AR', 'Mungala BM', 'Chapla A', 'Phatak AG', 'Nimbalkar SM']",2021,10,1,J Family Med Prim Care,"Patel IS, et al.

33984060,Cost-effectiveness of varicella and herpes zoster vaccination in Sweden: An economic evaluation using a dynamic transmission model.,"OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses of introducing varicella and/or herpes zoster vaccination in the Swedish national vaccination programme.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analyses based on epidemiological results from a specifically developed transmission model.
SETTING: National vaccination programme in Sweden, over an 85- or 20-year time horizon depending on the vaccination strategy.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts of people aged 12 months and 65-years at baseline.
INTERVENTIONS: Four alternative vaccination strategies; 1, not to vaccinate; 2, varicella vaccination with one dose of the live attenuated vaccine at age 12 months and a second dose at age 18 months; 3, herpes zoster vaccination with one dose of the live attenuated vaccine at 65 years of age; and 4, both vaccine against varicella and herpes zoster with the before-mentioned strategies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accumulated cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for each strategy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).
RESULTS: It would be cost-effective to vaccinate against varicella (dominant), but not to vaccinate against herpes zoster (ICER of EUR 200,000), assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of EUR 50,000 per QALY. The incremental analysis between varicella vaccination only and the combined programme results in a cost per gained QALY of almost EUR 1.6 million.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study are central components for policy-relevant decision-making, and suggest that it was cost-effective to introduce varicella vaccination in Sweden, whereas herpes zoster vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine for the elderly was not cost-effective-the health effects of the latter vaccination cannot be considered reasonable in relation to its costs. Future observational and surveillance studies are needed to make reasonable predictions on how boosting affects the herpes zoster incidence in the population, and thus the cost-effectiveness of a vaccination programme against varicella. Also, the link between herpes zoster and sequelae need to be studied in more detail to include it suitably in health economic evaluations.","['Wolff E', 'Widgren K', 'Scalia Tomba G', 'Roth A', 'Lep T', 'Andersson S']",2021,16,5,PLoS One,"Wolff E, et al.

33978301,Environmental risk factors are associated with autoimmune hepatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Failure of immunologic homeostasis and resultant hepatocyte destruction in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is likely the result of environmental triggers within a permissive genetic architecture.
AIMS: We aimed to identify risk factors associated with AIH in a well-phenotyped AIH cohort.
METHODS: We prospectively collected environmental questionnaires from 358 AIH cases and 563 healthy controls. Response frequencies were compared using logistic regression, adjusting for age at recruitment, sex and education.
RESULTS: AIH cases were more likely to ever have a urinary tract infection (UTI) (53.6% vs 33.9%, P < .001) and recurrent UTI (more than 1 per year) (23.5% vs 15.9%, P = .002) compared to controls. Female cases more frequently had ever used oral contraceptives (83.0% vs 73.7%, P = .006), fewer pregnancies (median = 1 vs 3, P < .001) and less often used hormone replacement therapy compared to controls (28.5% vs 60.1%, P < .001). Current smoking was more prevalent in cases (18.9% vs 7.4%, P = .022), yet no difference according to historical smoking behaviours was observed. Finally, cases were less likely to have history of mumps (32.4% vs 53.1%, P = .011) and rheumatic fever (1.1% vs 4.4%, P = .028), but reported higher vaccination frequency to chicken pox (38% vs 28.1%), measles (66.5% vs 39.3%), mumps (58.7% vs 34.6%), rubella (55.3% vs 32.7%), pertussis (59.8% vs 40.1%) and pneumococcus (47.2% VS 39.4%) (P < .002).

33959878,"Burden of Herpes Zoster in Adult Patients with Underlying Conditions: Analysis of German Claims Data, 2007-2018.","INTRODUCTION: Several chronic underlying conditions (UCs) are known to be risk factors for developing herpes zoster (HZ) and to increase the severity of HZ and its risk of recurrence. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and recurrence of HZ in adult patients with one or multiple UCs.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study based on claims data representing 13% of the statutory health insurance population from 2007 to 2018 in Germany was performed. Patients aged ≥ 18 years were included when at least one of the following UCs was diagnosed: asthma, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary heart disease (CHD), depression, diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Exact matching was used to account for differences in the distribution of age and sex between the case and matched control cohorts. Multi-morbidity was considered in sensitivity analyses by analyzing patients with only one UC.
RESULTS: Patients with asthma, CHD, COPD, depression, and RA had, on average, a 30% increased risk of developing acute HZ compared to patients without any UC. RA was found to have the highest odds ratio among these conditions, varying from 1.37 to 1.57 for all age groups. Patients with depression also showed a high risk of developing HZ. Analysis of recurrence indicated that patients with at least one UC in the age groups 18-49 years and 50-59 years had the highest risk for a recurrent HZ. After experiencing a first recurrence, patients, regardless of age group, had a two- to threefold higher risk for a second recurrence.
CONCLUSION: This study of representative claims data shows a higher HZ incidence and recurrence frequency in patients with UCs. These results provide relevant information for national health care guidelines and disease management programs.","['Batram M', 'Witte J', 'Schwarz M', 'Hain J', 'Ultsch B', 'Steinmann M', 'Bhavsar A', 'Wutzler P', 'Criée CP', 'Hermann C', 'Wahle K', 'Füchtenbusch M', 'Greiner W']",2021,11,3,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),"Batram M, et al.

Patients with varicella are thought to be infectious from 1 to 2 days before rash onset until all lesions are crusted, typically 4-7 days after onset of rash. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL databases to assess evidence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) transmission before varicella rash onset. Few articles (7) contributed epidemiologic evidence; no formal studies were found. Published articles reported infectiousness at variable intervals before rash onset, between <1 day to 4 days prior to rash, with 1-2 patients for each interval. Laboratory assessment of transmission before rash was also limited (10 articles). No culture-positive results were reported. VZV DNA was identified by PCR before rash onset in only one study however, PCR does not indicate infectivity of the virus. Based on available medical literature, VZV transmission before rash onset seems unlikely, although the possibility of pre-rash, respiratory transmission cannot be entirely ruled out.","['Marin M', 'Leung J', 'Lopez AS', 'Shepersky L', 'Schmid DS', 'Gershon AA']",2021,149,,Epidemiol Infect,"Marin M, et al.

33921858,Detection of Laryngotracheitis Virus in Poultry Flocks with Respiratory Disorders in Slovenia.,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute, highly contagious infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract in chickens and other poultry species that causes significant economic losses in countries worldwide. Between 2017 and 2019, seven outbreaks of mild to severe respiratory disorders with high suspicion of ILT occurred in commercial and backyard poultry flocks in Slovenia. In all submissions, infection with ILT virus (ILTV) was confirmed by PCR, which is the first report of ILT in Slovenia. Circulating ILT strains were characterized by the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of two fragments of the ICP4 gene. Four strains-three detected in non-vaccinated flocks and one in a flock vaccinated against ILT-were identical or very similar to the chicken embryo-origin live virus vaccines, and the other three were closely related to Russian, Chinese, Australian, and American field strains and to tissue culture origin vaccine strains. As in other diseases, coinfections with other respiratory pathogens in confirmed ILT cases may cause a more severe condition and prolong the course of the disease.

33895017,Evaluation of varicella vaccine effectiveness during outbreaks in schools or nurseries by cross-sectional study.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to elucidate vaccine effectiveness (VE) during varicella outbreaks in schools and nurseries in Japan.
METHODS: An outbreak was defined as emergence of three or more cases of varicella within 21 days at the same institute. Clinical information such as varicella vaccination status, and history of varicella was collected. If a child had varicella during the outbreak, information about absences, fever, and disease severity was collected.
RESULTS: From September 2018 to January 2020, four outbreaks were reported around our institute from three elementary schools and one nursery. A total of 676 children were analyzed in this study. Seventy-six children (11.2%) were unvaccinated, 309 (45.7%) had received one dose of vaccine, and 291 (43.0%) had received two doses. Most children in Pre-K2 (1-2 years old) to Pre-K6 (5-6 years old), who were the targets of the national immunization schedule, received two doses. Meanwhile, most children older than third grade received single dose. Seventy-five children (11.1%) had varicella. Varicella prevalence from Pre-K5 to the third grade was greater than 10%. The adjusted VEs of single- and two-dose of varicella vaccine were 57.8% and 89.0%. The number of days absent was significantly longer in unvaccinated children than single-dose recipients (P = 0.0145). Unvaccinated children had significantly more severe skin eruptions than single-dose recipients (P = 0.0046) and two-dose recipients (P = 0.0258).
CONCLUSIONS: Although VEs of single-dose varicella vaccination during outbreaks was not high, the VE of two-dose vaccination was similar to that in a previously reported case-control study.","['Kawamura Y', 'Hattori F', 'Higashimoto Y', 'Kozawa K', 'Yoshikawa T']",2021,39,21,Vaccine,"Kawamura Y, et al.

However, there is few data concerning the evolution and the optimal treatment of these rare associations.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year-old immunocompromised woman, who was treated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia 3 years prior to admission, was hospitalized with abdominal pain revealing severe acute pancreatitis. The day after admission, a pruritic rash appeared on her face, trunk, and limbs, sparing the palmoplantar regions. At the same time, fever, thrombocytopenia (27 × 109/L), major hyperferritinemia (11,063 μg/mL), hypertriglyceridemia (2.56 mmol/L) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (1441 IU/L) suggested HLH.
DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of chickenpox (varicella) was established. Primary VZV infection was then confirmed: cutaneous and plasma VZV polymerase chain reactions were positives, VZV serology was negative for IgG.
INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with aciclovir was started intravenously after the onset of the rash, for a total of 10 days. A 48-h surveillance in intensive care was carried out.
OUTCOMES: Acute pancreatitis and biological abnormalities evolved favorably under aciclovir. Platelet count was normalized 6 days after admission to hospital.
LESSONS: A favorable outcome of primary VZV infection associated with severe acute pancreatitis and probable HLH in an immunocompromised patient is possible with aciclovir alone.","['Bérar A', 'Ardois S', 'Walter-Moraux P', 'Jegonday MA', 'Henriot B']",2021,100,16,Medicine (Baltimore),"Bérar A, et al.

33872276,Health Impact and Cost-effectiveness Assessment for the Introduction of Universal Varicella Vaccination in Switzerland.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is a highly contagious infectious disease with substantial health and economic burden to society. Universal varicella vaccination (UVV) is not yet recommended by the Swiss National Immunization Program, which instead recommends catch-up immunization for children, adolescents and adults 11-40 years of age who have no reliable history of varicella or are varicella-zoster virus-IgG seronegative. The objective of this study was to perform an assessment of health impact and cost-effectiveness comparing UVV with current practice and recommendations in Switzerland.
METHODS: A dynamic transmission model for varicella was adapted to Switzerland comparing 2 base-case schedules (no infant vaccination and 10% coverage with infant vaccination) to 3 different UVV schedules using quadrivalent (varicella vaccine combined with measles-mumps-rubella) and standalone varicella vaccines administered at different ages. Modeled UVV coverage rates were based on current measles-mumps-rubella coverage of approximately 95% (first dose) and 90% (second dose). Direct medical costs and societal perspectives were considered, with cost and outcomes discounted and calculated over a 50-year time horizon.
RESULTS: UVV would reduce the number of varicella cases by 88%-90%, hospitalizations by 62%-69% and deaths by 75%-77%. UVV would increase direct medical costs by Swiss Franc (CHF) 39-49 (US $43-54) per capita and costs from a societal perspective by CHF 32-40 (US $35-44). Incremental quality-adjusted life-years per capita increased by 0.0012-0.0014. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the UVV schedules versus the base-case were CHF 31,194-35,403 (US $34,452-39,100) per quality-adjusted life-year from the direct medical cost perspective and CHF 25,245-29,552 (US $27,881-32,638) from the societal perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: UVV appears highly effective and cost-effective when compared with current clinical practice and recommendations in Switzerland from both a direct medical costs perspective and societal perspective.","['Heininger U', 'Pillsbury M', 'Samant S', 'Lienert F', 'Guggisberg P', 'Gani R', ""O'Brien E"", 'Pawaskar M']",2021,40,6,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Heininger U, et al.

METHODS: This was a phase IIIB follow-up of an observer-blind, randomized, controlled trial (NCT00226499). In phase A, healthy children aged 12-22 months from 10 European countries were randomized in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive two doses of MMRV (MMRV group), one dose of MMR followed by one dose of V (MMR + V group), or two doses of MMR (MMR; control group), 42 days apart. Vaccine efficacy (VE) against varicella (confirmed by viral DNA detection or epidemiological link and clinical assessment) was calculated with 95% confidence intervals using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Immunogenicity was assessed as seropositivity rates and geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 3705 children were vaccinated (1590, MMRV group; 1586, MMR + V group; 529, MMR group). There were 663 confirmed varicella cases (47, MMRV group; 349, MMR + V group; 267, MMR group). VE ranged between 95.4% (Lithuania) and 97.4% (Slovakia) in the MMRV group and between 59.3% (Lithuania) and 74% (Slovakia) in the MMR + V group. At year 10, seropositivity rates were 99.5%-100% in the MMRV group, 98%-100% in the MMR + V group and 50%-100% in the MMR control group, and the anti-VZV antibody GMCs were comparable between MMRV and MMR + V groups. The occurrence of solicited and unsolicited AEs was similar across groups and no SAE was considered as vaccination-related. No new safety concerns were identified.

33829948,Estimating the basic reproductive number of varicella in South Korea incorporating social contact patterns and seroprevalence.,"Varicella, which is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), is a common infectious disease affecting children.

R
0
 for varicella in South Korea was estimated to be 5.67 (95% CI: 5.33, 6.33). Therefore, to reach the herd immunity threshold, the critical vaccine coverage should be greater than 82.4% with a perfect vaccine, or the primary vaccine failure proportion should be less than 17.6% with 100% coverage. Because of the relatively low seroconversion rate and rapidly waning immunity after one-dose vaccination in South Korea, the herd immunity threshold is difficult to attain with only a one-dose vaccine. Two doses of vaccination may be necessary to effectively interrupt varicella transmission and maintain herd immunity in South Korea. The study results can help guide the decision-making on an effective varicella vaccination policy in South Korea.","['Lee T', 'Suh J', 'Choi JK', 'Lee J', 'Park SH']",2021,17,8,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Lee T, et al.

33814230,The impact of two-dose varicella vaccination on varicella and herpes zoster incidence in South Korea using a mathematical model with changing population demographics.,"BACKGROUND: In South Korea, one-dose varicella vaccination was introduced to the National Immunization Program in 2005, but varicella outbreaks have continued to occur. Therefore, a two-dose vaccination strategy is considered.
METHODS: We developed an age-structured deterministic compartment model using Korean population projection data. The impact of adding a second dose of varicella vaccine on varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) epidemiology was assessed under four different vaccine effectiveness (VE) scenarios (base, moderate, lowest, highest) and the optimal timing of the second vaccine dose (18 months, 4, 5, or 6 years of age) was examined over the period 2020-2065.
RESULTS: A two-dose vaccination schedule reduced the cumulative varicella incidence by > 90% compared to no vaccination, regardless of the VE. The additional reduction attributable to a second dose compared to a single dose was greatest (82%) with the lowest VE scenario. A second dose at 6 years of age reduced the varicella incidence at a population level, whereas a second dose at 18 months of age reduced the varicella incidence primarily in the target birth cohorts. Routine vaccination at the age of 18 months with a catch-up vaccination of 6-year-olds was the optimal strategy for birth cohort and population-level control. HZ incidence continued to increase under no vaccination scenario, which represents the effect of aging population. Under a two-dose scenario, the additional increase in HZ incidence attributable to the reduced exogenous boosting was small relative to a one-dose scenario and a further reduction in HZ cases was observed.
CONCLUSION: A two-dose varicella vaccination schedule would significantly reduce varicella and HZ incidence in the long term. A second dose at the age of 18 months with a catch-up vaccination of 6-year-olds would be optimal for controlling varicella in South Korea.","['Suh J', 'Lee T', 'Choi JK', 'Lee J', 'Park SH']",2021,39,18,Vaccine,"Suh J, et al.

The proportion with seroprotection (hSBA ≥1:8) to each meningococcal serogroup at Day 30 was comparable between the MenACYW-TT and MenACYW-TT + MMR + V groups (≥92 and ≥96%, respectively), between the MenACYW-TT and MenACYW-TT + DTaP-IPV-HepB-Hib groups (≥90% for both) and between the MenACYW-TT and MenACYW-TT + PCV13 groups (≥91 and ≥84%, respectively). The safety profiles of MenACYW-TT, and MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HepB-Hib, and PCV13, with or without MenACYW-TT, were generally comparable.

With lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that were approved by the FDA as vectors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines, we designed a series of vaccines efficiently encapsulated with varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (VZV-gE) and nucleic acids including polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and the natural phosphodiester CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN), which was approved by the FDA as an immunostimulator in a hepatitis B vaccine. Preclinical trial in mice showed that these LNP vaccines could induce VZV-gE IgG titers more than 16 times those induced by an alum adjuvant, and immunized serum could block in vitro infection completely at a dilution of 1:80, which indicated potential as a varicella vaccine. The magnitude of the cell-mediated immunity induced was generally more than 10 times that induced by the alum adjuvant, indicating potential as a zoster vaccine. These results showed that immunostimulatory nucleic acids together with LNPs have promise as safe and economical varicella and zoster vaccine candidates.","['Cao H', 'Wang Y', 'Luan N', 'Liu C']",2021,9,4,Vaccines (Basel),"Cao H, et al.

33804210,Varicella-Zoster Virus Infection of Neurons Derived from Neural Stem Cells.,"Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpesvirus that causes varicella (chickenpox) as a primary infection, and, following a variable period of ganglionic latency in neurons, it reactivates to cause herpes zoster (shingles). An analysis of VZV infection in cultures of neural cells, in particular when these have been obtained from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or neural stem cells consisting of highly purified neuronal cultures, has revealed much data that may be of neurobiological significance. Early studies of VZV infection of mature cultured neural cells were mainly descriptive, but more recent studies in homogeneous neural stem cell cultures have used both neuronal cell markers and advanced molecular technology. Two general findings from such studies have been that (a) VZV infection of neurons is less severe, based on several criteria, than that observed in human fibroblasts, and (b) VZV infection of neurons does not lead to apoptosis in these cells in contrast to apoptosis observed in fibroblastic cells. Insights gained from such studies in human neural stem cells suggest that a less severe initial lytic infection in neurons, which are resistant to apoptosis, is likely to facilitate a pathological pathway to a latent state of the virus in human ganglia.","['Kennedy PGE', 'Mogensen TH']",2021,13,3,Viruses,Kennedy PGE and Mogensen TH.

In observational epidemiologic studies it is not possible to estimate intake of prebiotics, but quantifying intake of dietary fiber is routine. Our objective was to investigate the potential effect of dietary fiber on immunogenicity. We examined serum antibody concentrations (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella) in relation to dietary fiber in more than 12,000 subjects in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the period 1999-2004. Data from one (1999-2002) or two (2003-2004) dietary recalls were used to calculate fiber intake. For Mumps the adjusted percentage difference in antibody concentration per interquartile range intake in energy-adjusted dietary fiber was 6.34% (95% confidence interval, 3.10, 9.68). Fiber from grain-based foods was more positively associated than fiber from other fiber-containing food groups. The association was slightly larger among subgroups with higher fiber intake, greater interquartile range in fiber intake, and less measurement error. Furthermore, based on the reliability of the diet recalls in 2003-2004, we calculated that the percentage difference per interquartile increment was substantially attenuated by measurement error. Dietary fiber may have a favorable influence on the immunogenicity of some vaccines or natural infections.","['Van Landingham CB', 'Keast DR', 'Longnecker MP']",2021,13,3,Nutrients,"Van Landingham CB, et al.

33785002,"Antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of Mahanintangtong and its constituent herbs, a formula used in Thai traditional medicine for treating pharyngitis.","BACKGROUND: Mahanintangtong is listed in the Thailand's National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). It is used to treat non-specific fevers and illnesses such as pharyngitis and chickenpox. In this study, we investigated the biological activities of the different medicinal plants used in the Mahanintangtong formula.
METHODS: The plant materials were extracted by maceration and decoction. Antimicrobial activity, assessed by disc diffusion method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were compared with commercially available standard antibiotics. To elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms, inhibition of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) production was tested by Griess and ELISA techniques. Antioxidant activity was measured by ABTS and DPPH scavenging assays.
RESULTS: The extracts with the best antimicrobial activities were carbonized Tectona grandis showing against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ethanol extract of Dracaena loureiroi wood exhibited the highest NO and IL-6 inhibitory activity with IC
CONCLUSION: The ethanol extracts from carbonized T. grandis and Mahanintangtong showed good antimicrobial activity, especially against S. pyogenes, and good anti-inflammatory activity. These findings are relevant to the pathogenesis of pharyngitis and justify additional studies to see if Mahanintangtong could have clinical utility.","['Dechayont B', 'Phuaklee P', 'Chunthorng-Orn J', 'Juckmeta T', 'Prajuabjinda O', 'Jiraratsatit K']",2021,21,1,BMC Complement Med Ther,"Dechayont B, et al.

33766658,Isolation and molecular detection of pigeon pox virus in Assiut and New Valley governorates.,"Pigeon Poxvirus (PPV) was detected in eight pigeons suffering from wart like nodular lesions in two Egyptian governorates (Assiut and New Valley) during summer 2018. Different serological and molecular techniques were carried out for isolation and detection of the virus on chorio-allantoic membranes (CAM) of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. The characteristic pock lesions were detected on CAMs, whereas PPV was isolated. Electron microscopy revealed enveloped brick shaped Avipoxvirions. The neutralizing antibodies against PPV were detected in six out of eight samples. Serum neutralization test revealed a neutralization index of ≥ 1.6, while ELISA revealed an S/P ratio of ≥ 1.4 in the affected pigeons. Nucleotide sequence of P4b of Pigeon poxvirus isolated from nodule 1 sample (PPVNV1), revealed 100 % nucleotide identity to PPV and only 90 % nucleotide identity with Fowl poxvirus (FPV). P4b locus based SYBR green QPCR produced PPV amplicons of 77.33-77.83 °C melting temperature (Tm). QPCR SYBR green assay successfully differentiated PPV from FPV amplicon which revealed a dissociation curve of Tm =75.85 °C. This is the first report discriminating PPV from FPV based on SYBR green qPCR approach of P4b locus.

33736915,Correlation of protection against varicella in a randomized Phase III varicella-containing vaccine efficacy trial in healthy infants.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella vaccination confers high and long-lasting protection against chickenpox and induces robust immune responses, but an absolute correlate of protection (CoP) against varicella has not been established. This study models the relationship between varicella humoral response and protection against varicella.
METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of data from a Phase IIIb, multicenter, randomized trial (NCT00226499) conducted in ten varicella-endemic European countries. Healthy children aged 12-22 months were randomized 3:3:1 to receive one dose of measles-mumps-rubella and one dose of varicella vaccine (one-dose group) or two doses of measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (two-dose group) or two doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (control group) six weeks apart. The study remained observer-blind until completion, except in countries with obligatory additional immunizations. The objective was to correlate varicella-specific antibody concentrations with protection against varicella and probability of varicella breakthrough, using Cox proportional hazards and Dunning and accelerated failure time statistical models. The analysis was guided by the Prentice framework to explore a CoP against varicella.
RESULTS: The trial included 5803 participants, 5289 in the efficacy (2266: one-dose group, 2279: two-dose group and 744: control group) and 5235 (2248, 2245 and 742 in the same groups) in the immunogenicity cohort. The trial ended in 2016 with a median follow-up time of 9.8 years. Six weeks after vaccination with one- or two-dose varicella-containing vaccine, more than 93.0% of vaccinees were seropositive for varicella-specific antibodies. Estimated vaccine efficacy correlated positively with antibody concentrations. The fourth Prentice CoP criterion was not met, due to predicted positive vaccine efficacy in seronegative participants. Further modelling showed decreased probability of moderate to severe varicella breakthrough with increasing varicella-specific antibody concentrations (ten-year probability <0.1 for antibody concentrations ≥2-fold above the seropositivity cut-off).
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella-specific antibody concentrations are a good predictor of protection, given their inverse correlation with varicella occurrence.

33733653,Exploring the Seasonal Drivers of Varicella Zoster Virus Transmission and Reactivation.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a herpesvirus that causes chickenpox and shingles. The biological mechanisms underpinning the multidecadal latency of VZV in the body and subsequent viral reactivation-which occurs in approximately 30% of individuals-are largely unknown. Because chickenpox and shingles are endemic worldwide, understanding the relationship between VZV transmission and reactivation is important for informing disease treatment and control. While chickenpox is a vaccine-preventable childhood disease with a rich legacy of research, shingles is not a notifiable disease in most countries. To date, population-level studies of shingles have had to rely on small-scale hospital or community-level data sets. Here, we examined chickenpox and shingles notifications from Thailand and found strong seasonal incidence in both diseases, with a 3-month lag between peak chickenpox transmission season and peak shingles reactivation. We tested and fitted 14 mathematical models examining the biological drivers of chickenpox and shingles over an 8-year period to estimate rates of VZV transmission, reactivation, and immunity-boosting, wherein reexposure to VZV boosts VZV-specific immunity to reinforce protection against shingles. The models suggested that the seasonal cycles of chickenpox and shingles have different underlying mechanisms, with ambient levels of ultraviolet radiation being correlated with shingles reactivation.","['Bakker KM', 'Eisenberg MC', 'Woods R', 'Martinez ME']",2021,190,9,Am J Epidemiol,"Bakker KM, et al.

33727523,Chronic Headache and Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Due to Varicella Zoster Virus Infection: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"BACKGROUND Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection causes 2 clinically distinct forms of the disease: varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Primary VZV infection results in the diffuse vesicular rash of varicella, or chickenpox. Endogenous reactivation of latent VZV typically results in a localized skin infection known as herpes zoster, or shingles. The infection usually manifests as a self-limited disease. However, it can be associated with various neurological complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, ventriculitis, cerebellar ataxia, ischemic or hemorrhagic, and, rarely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). This report presents a case of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis due to varicella zoster virus infection in a 20-year-old Nepalese man who presented to the Emergency Department with headache. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old Nepalese male patient presented to the Emergency Department with headache of 10 day's duration. Five days prior to that, he had a diffuse pruritic skin rash. Examination as well as serology confirmed the presence of primary varicella infection. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) demonstrated CVST. Thrombophilia workup revealed a transient elevation of antiphospholipid serology. Shortly after admission, the patient had a transient seizure. He was treated with acyclovir, levetiracetam, and anticoagulation. A comprehensive literature review of similar cases was performed to establish a link between thrombotic complications and primary VZV infection and to formulate possible mechanistic pathways. CONCLUSIONS This report shows that primary VSV infection can be associated with vasculopathy and CVST. Physicians should recognize this serious complication, which should be diagnosed and treated without delay.","['Alamlih L', 'Abdulgayoom M', 'Menik Arachchige SN', 'Shah MH', 'Zahid M']",2021,22,,Am J Case Rep,"Alamlih L, et al.

METHODS: Demographic data were obtained from Statistics Sweden on >3000 children admitted to Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital in 2009-2014 with rotavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or chickenpox. We compared demographic and socio-economic factors between case groups using logistic regression with rotavirus cases as reference.
RESULTS: There were differences in the median age at admission; RSV cases were younger (0.4 years), influenza (2.4 years) and chickenpox cases (2.7 years) older than rotavirus cases (1.2 years). RSV, influenza and chickenpox cases lived in families with more children than rotavirus cases. RSV and influenza cases were more likely to have underlying chronic conditions. Mothers of RSV cases were more likely to be born in Sweden. Further socio-economic differences were not robustly confirmed in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: We found a few differences in demographic factors between children hospitalised with the four common infections, which were mainly explained by the epidemiology and transmission patterns of these infections.","['Widgren K', 'Eriksson M', 'Bennet R', 'Giesecke J']",2021,110,8,Acta Paediatr,"Widgren K, et al.

33672709,Advances and Perspectives in the Management of Varicella-Zoster Virus Infections.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a common and ubiquitous human-restricted pathogen, causes a primary infection (varicella or chickenpox) followed by establishment of latency in sensory ganglia. The virus can reactivate, causing herpes zoster (HZ, shingles) and leading to significant morbidity but rarely mortality, although in immunocompromised hosts, VZV can cause severe disseminated and occasionally fatal disease. We discuss VZV diseases and the decrease in their incidence due to the introduction of live-attenuated vaccines to prevent varicella or HZ. We also focus on acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir (FDA approved drugs to treat VZV infections), brivudine (used in some European countries) and amenamevir (a helicase-primase inhibitor, approved in Japan) that augur the beginning of a new era of anti-VZV therapy. Valnivudine hydrochloride (FV-100) and valomaciclovir stearate (in advanced stage of development) and several new molecules potentially good as anti-VZV candidates described during the last year are examined. We reflect on the role of antiviral agents in the treatment of VZV-associated diseases, as a large percentage of the at-risk population is not immunized, and on the limitations of currently FDA-approved anti-VZV drugs. Their low efficacy in controlling HZ pain and post-herpetic neuralgia development, and the need of multiple dosing regimens requiring daily dose adaptation for patients with renal failure urges the development of novel anti-VZV drugs.","['Andrei G', 'Snoeck R']",2021,26,4,Molecules,Andrei G and Snoeck R.

Vaccination is an effective form of prevention. Prior to universal vaccination against chickenpox, high incidence was recorded in many countries. In Poland, since 2003, vaccinations have been carried out recommended for people who did not suffer from chickenpox and, since 2009, obligatory vaccinations for children up to 12 years of age. particularly vulnerable to infection and children around them.
AIM: To assess epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2018, including vaccination coverage in Polish population, in comparison to previous years.
METHODS: Assessment of the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2018. was based on the results of the analysis of aggregate data published in the annual bulletins: ""Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2018"" and ""Protective Vaccination in Poland in 2017. In addition, the recommendations from the Protective Vaccine Program for 2018 were used.
RESULTS: In 2018, 149,565 cases of chickenpox were registered in Poland, i.e. 15.8% less than in the previous year. The incidence of chickenpox in 2018 was 389.4 per 100 thousand. and was lower than in 2017. The lowest incidence was registered in the Dolnośląskie Voivodeship - 267.5 / 100 thousand, the highest in the Pomorskie Voivodeship - 502.0 / 100 thousand. Children aged 0-4 years became ill the most (72,797). The incidence of chicken pox in men was higher than in women, and in rural areas it was higher than in urban areas. Hospitalization due to chickenpox in 2018 covered 1,089 people, which accounted for 0.72% of the total number of registered cases.
SUMMARY: In 2018, there was a decrease in the number of smallpox cases compared to the previous year, the incidence remains lower than in 2012-2014. An effective method of disease prevention is vaccination against chickenpox, which, despite the lack of common funding, is carried out in a growing population. Further improvement of the epidemiological situation requires health education of the society in the field of primary prevention, which is based on vaccinations. As recommended, the smallpox vaccination course consists of two doses of the vaccine separated by at least 6 weeks from the previous dose.","['Bogusz J', 'Paradowska-Stankiewicz I']",2020,74,3,Przegl Epidemiol,Bogusz J and Paradowska-Stankiewicz I.

33570083,"Six years of activity of the Italian vaccine portal ""VaccinarSì"": a web traffic evaluation using Google Analytics.","BACKGROUND: Despite the scientific consensus about vaccines safety and effectiveness, there is still a discrepancy between scientific evidence and perception by the general population. The ""VaccinarSì"" portal was created in 2013 by Italian specialists in Public Health to provide evidence-based information regarding vaccination.
STUDY DESIGN: The purpose of this study was to analyse the web traffic on ""VaccinarSì"" platform during a six-year period (May 8, 2013-May 8, 2019). Moreover, we compared the first six-month with the last six-month period of the website activity, to identify potential areas of improvements.
METHODS: This is a descriptive study using Google Analytics data. We collected data regarding the following: total number of sessions to the portal, total number of pages viewed, total number of users and the number of new visitors, geographical locations and demography of users as well as user access mode (type of device used and way of access). We also collected some data that were informative about the possibility to infer the level of visitors' engagement with the portal, such as thee number of returning users, bounce rate, number of pages visited per session and mean session duration.
RESULTS: Throughout the relevant period, the portal has consistently increased its popularity, with a remarkable increment of monthly connections (ending up to more than 80,000/month) from all over Italy. Visitors were mainly female (71.1%), aged between 25 and 44 years (64.7%). Healthcare professionals were responsible for a considerable proportion of accesses (50.6%). The mobile has become the dominant device used to access the portal, accounting for 77.8% of total connection in the last six months. Similarly, in the last period, organic search accounted for 92% of all connections. Measles and MPR vaccine, as well as chickenpox and hexavalent vaccine, have remained the most appealing topics of interest among visitors over the years. The page that attracted more visitors over the six years was ""real risks and benefits of vaccination"", accounting for 5.67% of total sessions with a high mean duration spent of 05:08 minutes.
CONCLUSION: During the six years of activity, overall, the level of users' engagement with the portal has dropped with an increased bounce rate and a lower average number of pages visited per session and a lower mean duration of each connection. The lowest engagement involved connections accessed through mobile devices. Results helped ""Vaccinarsi"" developers to speculate about future strategies to further increase the platform popularity and optimize visitors' engagement.","['Bordin P', 'Melot B', 'Tralli V', 'Bertoni C', 'Moretti F', 'Siddu A', 'Baldo V', 'Bonanni P', 'Castiglia P', 'Majori S', 'Ferro A']",2021,33,2,Ann Ig,"Bordin P, et al.

33551039,The Influence of Immune Immaturity on Outcome After Virus Infections.,"Maturation of the adaptive immune response is typically thought to improve outcome to virus infections. However, long-standing observations of natural infections with old viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and newer observations of emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 responsible for COVID-19 suggest that immune immaturity may be beneficial for outcome. Mechanistic studies and studies of patients with inborn errors of immunity have revealed that immune dysregulation reflecting inappropriate antibody and T-cell responses plays a crucial role in causing bystander inflammation and more severe disease. Further evidence supports a role for innate immunity in normally regulating adaptive immune responses. Thus, changes in immune responses that normally occur with age may help explain an apparent protective role of immune immaturity during virus infections.","['Shaw ER', 'Su HC']",2021,9,2,J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,Shaw ER and Su HC.

33537162,Impact of seasonal influenza on polyclinic attendances for upper respiratory tract infections in Singapore.,"PURPOSE: The burden of influenza on primary health-care services is not well established in tropical countries, where there are no clearly defined influenza seasons. We aimed to estimate the association between influenza infection activity and polyclinic attendance rates for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in the Singapore population.
METHODS: We used generalized additive time series models to estimate the association between the proportion of respiratory tests positive for influenza infection in Singapore reported to the World Health Organization every week, and the population rate of polyclinic attendances in Singapore for physician-diagnosed URTI, which includes influenza-like illness (ILI), for six years from 2012 through 2017. Where data were available, we controlled for other infections that can cause fever or respiratory symptoms.
RESULTS: Influenza, dengue fever and chickenpox (varicella) were positively associated with acute URTI polyclinic attendances. The estimated URTI polyclinic attendance rates attributable to influenza, dengue fever and chickenpox were 618.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 501.6-736.3), 153.3 (95% CI: 16.5-290.2) and 1751.5 (95% CI: 1246.3-2256.8) per 100 000 population per year, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Influenza poses a considerable burden on primary health-care services in Singapore. However, a substantial number of polyclinic attendances due to febrile infections such as dengue fever and chickenpox appear to be recorded as URTI in the polyclinic database. These associations require further investigation.","['Soh ACY', 'Sharma A', 'Muscatello DJ']",2020,11,2,Western Pac Surveill Response J,"Soh ACY, et al.

33514404,Serious infectious events and ibuprofen administration in pediatrics: a narrative review in the era of COVID-19 pandemic.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite its recognized efficacy and tolerability profile, during the last decade a rise of adverse events following ibuprofen administration in children has been reported, including a possible role in worsening the clinical course of infections. Our aim was to critically evaluate the safety of ibuprofen during the course of pediatric infectious disease in order to promote its appropriate use in children.
RECENT FINDINGS: Ibuprofen is associated with severe necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) during chickenpox course. Pre-hospital use of ibuprofen seems to increase the risk of complicated pneumonia in children. Conflicting data have been published in septic children, while ibuprofen in the setting of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) exacerbations is safe and efficacious. No data is yet available for ibuprofen use during COVID-19 course. Ibuprofen should not be recommended for chickenpox management. Due to possible higher risks of complicated pneumonia, we suggest caution on its use in children with respiratory symptoms. While it remains unclear whether ibuprofen may have harmful effects during systemic bacterial infection, its administration is recommended in CF course. Despite the lack of data, it is seems cautious to prefer the use of paracetamol during COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome in children.","['Quaglietta L', 'Martinelli M', 'Staiano A']",2021,47,1,Ital J Pediatr,"Quaglietta L, et al.

33499846,"Thoughts, beliefs and concepts concerning infectious childhood diseases of physicians practicing homeopathic, anthroposophic and conventional medicine - a qualitative study.","BACKGROUND: Physicians who include complementary medicine in their practice are thought to have an understanding of health and disease different from that of colleagues practicing conventional medicine. The aim of this study was to identify and compare the thoughts and concepts concerning infectious childhood diseases (measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, pertussis and scarlet fever) of physicians practicing homeopathic, anthroposophic and conventional medicine.
METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured interviews. Participating physicians were either general practitioners or pediatricians. Data collection and analysis were guided by a grounded theory approach.
RESULTS: Eighteen physicians were interviewed (6 homeopathic, 6 anthroposophic and 6 conventional). All physicians agreed that while many classic infectious childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella are rarely observed today, other diseases, such as chickenpox and scarlet fever, are still commonly diagnosed. All interviewed physicians vaccinated against childhood diseases. A core concern for physicians practicing conventional medicine was the risk of complications of the diseases. Therefore, it was considered essential for them to advise their patients to strictly follow the vaccination schedule. Homeopathic-oriented physicians viewed acute disease as a biological process necessary to strengthen health, fortify the immune system and increase resistance to chronic disease. They tended to treat infectious childhood diseases with homeopathic remedies and administered available vaccines as part of individual decision-making approaches with parents. For anthroposophic-oriented physicians, infectious childhood diseases were considered a crucial factor in the psychosocial growth of children. They tended to treat these diseases with anthroposophic medicine and underlined the importance of the family's resources. Informing parents about the potential benefits and risks of vaccination was considered important. All physicians agreed that parent-delivered loving care of a sick child could benefit the parent-child relationship. Additionally, all recognized that existing working conditions hindered parents from providing such care for longer durations of time.
CONCLUSIONS: The interviewed physicians agreed that vaccines are an important aspect of modern pediatrics. They differed in their approach regarding when and what to vaccinate against. The different conceptual understandings of infectious childhood diseases influenced this decision-making. A survey with a larger sample would be needed to verify these observations.","['Mittring-Junghans N', 'Holmberg C', 'Witt CM', 'Teut M']",2021,21,1,BMC Complement Med Ther,"Mittring-Junghans N, et al.

33431153,What We Know Now: An Economic Evaluation of Chickenpox Vaccination and Dose Timing Using an Agent-Based Model.,"OBJECTIVES: The value of chickenpox vaccination is still debated in the literature and by jurisdictions worldwide. This uncertainty is reflected in the inconsistent uptake of the vaccine, where some countries offer routine childhood immunization programs, others have targeted programs, and in many the vaccine is only privately available. Even across the countries that have universal funding for the vaccine, there is a diversity of schedules and dosing intervals. Using an agent-based model of chickenpox and shingles, we conducted an economic evaluation of chickenpox vaccination in Alberta, Canada.
METHODS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of 2 common chickenpox vaccination schedules, specifically a long dosing interval (first dose: 12 months; second dose: 4-6 years) and a short dosing interval (first dose: 12 months; second dose: 18 months).
RESULTS: The economic evaluation demonstrated a shorter dosing interval may be marginally preferred, although it consistently led to higher costs from both the societal and healthcare perspectives. We found that chickenpox vaccination would be cost-saving and highly cost-effective from the societal and healthcare perspective, assuming there was no impact on shingles.
CONCLUSION: Chickenpox vaccine was cost-effective when not considering shingles and remained so even if there was a minor increase in shingles following vaccination. However, if chickenpox vaccination did lead to a substantial increase in shingles, then chickenpox vaccination was not cost-effective from the healthcare perspective.","['Rafferty ERS', 'McDonald W', 'Osgood ND', 'Doroshenko A', 'Farag M']",2021,24,1,Value Health,"Rafferty ERS, et al.

33407202,Acceptance of universal varicella vaccination among Swiss pediatricians and general practitioners who treat pediatric patients.,"BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, several countries have initiated universal varicella vaccination (UVV) programs in infants. In 2019, the Swiss National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) decided to start evaluating the introduction of universal varicella vaccination. There is a theoretical concern that suboptimal vaccination coverage could lead to a shift in the varicella incidence to older age groups, thereby potentially increasing complication rates. To achieve a high vaccination coverage rate, it is important that practicing physicians comply with a potential recommendation for UVV. We studied the perception of varicella and the current vaccination behavior among Swiss pediatricians and general practitioners (GPs) who treat children. We also assessed their intention to advise parents to vaccinate their children against varicella in the event the Swiss NITAG will recommend UVV.
METHODS: Primary data was collected through a structured, 20-min online survey with Swiss pediatricians and GPs who treat children.
RESULTS: 150 physicians participated in the study: 40 GPs in the German-speaking part, 20 GPs in the French-speaking part, 67 pediatricians in the German-speaking part, and 23 pediatricians in the French-speaking part. The majority (64%) of all participants reported that they currently recommend varicella vaccination for risk groups according to the national immunization plan. About one third of physicians (35%) - predominantly pediatricians - currently already recommend it for all infants. In these situations, a measles, mumps, rubella, varicella combination vaccine is currently used by 58% for the first dose and by 59% for the second dose. 86% of participants stated that they would advise parents to have their children vaccinated against varicella in case of a recommendation for UVV by the Swiss NITAG. 68% responded that they expect many questions from parents and 65% agreed that they have good arguments to convey the importance of varicella vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: The survey study results show that most participating pediatricians and GPs indicated a favorable attitude towards childhood vaccination against varicella in the setting of a Swiss NITAG recommendation for UVV. This data shows the importance of NITAG recommendations in influencing vaccine education and supporting achievement of high coverage of varicella vaccination.","['Lienert F', 'Weiss O', 'Schmitt K', 'Heininger U', 'Guggisberg P']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Lienert F, et al.

We sought to evaluate the safety of LAVs, including measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella to LT recipients following our clinically based immunization protocol for LT recipients. We conducted a case-series analysis on safety of LAVs for measles, rubella, varicella, and mumps given to LT recipients at our institution from July 2010 to July 2019. Patients who underwent LT at age <20 years who visited our immunization clinic were included. LT recipients were vaccinated if 2 years had lapsed from LT, had no signs of rejection within 6 months, and were on minimal immunosuppressants. Patient demographics, underlying diseases, type and number of vaccines administered, date of vaccination, and adverse events occurring within 4 weeks after vaccination were extracted from their medical records. During the study period, LAVs were administered 422 times to 209 patients who met criteria and included 225 doses of MR combination vaccine, 224 doses of varicella vaccine, and 215 doses of mumps vaccine. Underlying diseases included cholestatic liver diseases (n = 125), followed by metabolic diseases (n = 33) and acute liver failure (n = 19). Nine non-critical adverse events (2.1%) possibly associated with LAVs were reported, but there were no serious adverse events, including hospitalizations or deaths.

Generalized small itchy single-standing vesicles on erythematous skin are typical. Both cutaneous and systemic complications of the VZV infection may commonly occur. A three-year-old girl with a previous history of mild atopic dermatitis presented in our Pediatric Dermatology Clinic in poor general condition, with a skin rash predominantly consisting of generalized large blisters with hypopyon sign and erosions. On a closer look, scattered erythematous papules and vesicles were also visible. A positive Tzanck smear from an intact pinhead-sized vesicle and VZV PCR confirmed the clinical diagnosis of chickenpox. Cultures from hypopyon material revealed Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. We report an exceptional, not-yet described complication of chickenpox with hypopyon-forming superinfection in an atopic child. In addition, our case nicely underscores the necessity of early VZV vaccination, which has been available and recommended now for more than 10 years in pediatric vaccination programs to avoid severe complications.","['Gorris A', 'Weiss D', 'Kogler H', 'Szépfalusi Z', 'Karlhofer F', 'Handisurya A', 'Weninger W', 'Kinaciyan T']",2021,171,03월 04일,Wien Med Wochenschr,"Gorris A, et al.

Twenty-five cases were included in this review. Children who had VZV reactivation meningitis after vaccination were younger (7 ± 3.4 years vs. 11.9 ± 3.6 years, P = 0.0038), had a shorter interval between first exposure to reactivation (5.6 ± 2.9 years vs. 8.8 ± 3.2 years, P = 0.018) and more likely to have a rash (100% vs. 55%, P = 0.04).

33294726,Successful oral treatment of third cranial nerve palsy and optic neuritis from neglected herpes zoster in an immunocompetent patient.,"PURPOSE: Herpes zoster (HZ) is an acute viral eruption caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), a herpes virus causing chicken pox in children. We aimed to report a 3-month 
OBSERVATIONS: A 36-year old immunocompetent Egyptian male patient presented with 3-month complaints of blurred vision and drooping of his left upper eyelid that appeared 4 days after a herpetic rash. He had been diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) of the left eye. However, he had not received any systemic antiviral treatment. The patient had an abnormal head posture with post-eruptive scars on the left forehead and the nose tip. Examination revealed weakness of elevation and adduction, partial ptosis, and mid-dilated non-reactive pupil in the left eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present in the affected eye. His blood sugar and blood pressure were within normal limits. Contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no space-occupying lesion. However, there were enhancement and enlargement of the left optic nerve on T1-weighted images, denoting optic neuritis. A diagnosis of acute left third nerve palsy with pupil involvement and optic neuritis secondary to HZO was made. Despite late treatment with oral acyclovir and prednisolone, the patient recovered. One and a half months later, he developed a late-onset keratouveitis about 8 months after the rash onset. After the resolution of the episode, oral acyclovir was continued at a prophylactic dose (400 mg BID).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: HZ is a rare cause of third nerve palsy with pupil involvement and optic neuritis. Oral acyclovir and steroids were effective in the delayed treatment in this case. Abnormal optic nerve enhancement on MRI 3 months after the appearance of vesicular rash may suggest chronic HZ activity. Concurrent optic neuritis and third cranial nerve palsy in the absence of other signs of orbital apex syndrome can be seen in cases of HZO. Regular follow-up of patients with HZ is important for detecting recurrence and initiating prompt treatment.",['Osman SA'],2020,20,,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,Osman SA.

33294116,"Prevalence of skin diseases in children 1 to 6 years old in the city of Bogota, Colombia.","BACKGROUND: Skin diseases represent an important part of the morbidity among children and are possibly influenced by geographic, racial, social, cultural, and economic factors. Despite being so frequent around the world, skin diseases have not been important in developing strategies in public health.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of skin diseases among the student population between 1 and 6 years of age in Bogotá, Colombia between March 2009 and June 2011.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed across a probabilistic, stratified, randomized sampling by proportional assignment (based on locality and type of institution) and was developed in schools in Bogotá, Colombia.
RESULTS: A total of 2437 children between 1 and 6 years of age were examined, and 42.8% (1035) presented a dermatologic disease. Papular urticaria was the most frequent (62.9%) (IC: 58.4%; 67.1%), followed by dermatitis/eczema (13.0%) (IC: 10.8%; 15.4%), and infectious diseases (12.3%) (IC: 9.7%; 15.3%).
CONCLUSION: The research demonstrates a high prevalence of papular urticaria as a result of flea and mosquito bites and infectious diseases of the skin in the studied population. The dermatologic diseases found are easy to diagnose, respond to the proper treatment, and are preventable. However, the fact that many of the examined children likely had not visited the doctor for the detected pathology could indicate the lack of access to health services affecting this population.","['García E', 'Halpert E', 'Borrero E', 'Ibañez M', 'Chaparro P', 'Molina J', 'Torres M']",2020,13,12,World Allergy Organ J,"García E, et al.

33259590,Varicella-zoster virus: molecular controls of cell fusion-dependent pathogenesis.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of chicken pox (varicella) and shingles (zoster). Although considered benign diseases, both varicella and zoster can cause complications. Zoster is painful and can lead to post herpetic neuralgia. VZV has also been linked to stroke, related to giant cell arteritis in some cases. Vaccines are available but the attenuated vaccine is not recommended in immunocompromised individuals and the efficacy of the glycoprotein E (gE) based subunit vaccine has not been evaluated for the prevention of varicella. A hallmark of VZV pathology is the formation of multinucleated cells termed polykaryocytes in skin lesions. This cell-cell fusion (abbreviated as cell fusion) is mediated by the VZV glycoproteins gB, gH and gL, which constitute the fusion complex of VZV, also needed for virion entry. Expression of gB, gH and gL during VZV infection and trafficking to the cell surface enables cell fusion. Recent evidence supports the concept that cellular processes are required for regulating cell fusion induced by gB/gH-gL. Mutations within the carboxyl domains of either gB or gH have profound effects on fusion regulation and dramatically restrict the ability of VZV to replicate in human skin. This loss of regulation modifies the transcriptome of VZV infected cells. Furthermore, cellular proteins have significant effects on the regulation of gB/gH-gL-mediated cell fusion and the replication of VZV, exemplified by the cellular phosphatase, calcineurin. This review provides the current state-of-the-art knowledge about the molecular controls of cell fusion-dependent pathogenesis caused by VZV.","['Oliver SL', 'Zhou M', 'Arvin AM']",2020,48,6,Biochem Soc Trans,"Oliver SL, et al.

33243541,The role of respiratory droplet physicochemistry in limiting and promoting the airborne transmission of human coronaviruses: A critical review.,"Whether virulent human pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) are effectively transmitted by aerosols remains contentious. Transmission modes of the novel coronavirus have become a hot topic of research with the importance of airborne transmission controversial due to the many factors that can influence virus transmission. Airborne transmission is an accepted potential route for the spread of some viral infections (measles, chickenpox); however, aerosol features and infectious inoculum vary from one respiratory virus to another. Infectious virus-laden aerosols can be produced by natural human respiratory activities, and their features are vital determinants for virus carriage and transmission. Physicochemical characteristics of infectious respiratory aerosols can influence the efficiency of virus transmission by droplets. This critical review identifies studies reporting instances of infected patients producing airborne human pathogenic coronaviruses, and evidence for the role of physical/chemical characteristics of human-generated droplets in altering embedded viruses' viability. We also review studies evaluating these viruses in the air, field studies and available evidence about seasonality patterns. Ultimately the literature suggests that a proportion of virulent human coronaviruses can plausibly be transmitted via the air, even though this might vary in different conditions. Evidence exists for respirable-sized airborne droplet nuclei containing viral RNA, although this does not necessarily imply that the virus is transmittable, capable of replicating in a recipient host, or that inoculum is sufficient to initiate infection. However, evidence suggests that coronaviruses can survive in simulated droplet nuclei for a significant time (>24 h). Nevertheless, laboratory nebulized virus-laden aerosols might not accurately model the complexity of human carrier aerosols in studying airborne viral transport. In summary, there is disagreement on whether wild coronaviruses can be transmitted via an airborne path and display seasonal patterns. Further studies are therefore required to provide supporting evidence for the role of airborne transmission and assumed mechanisms underlying seasonality.","['Niazi S', 'Groth R', 'Spann K', 'Johnson GR']",2021,276,,Environ Pollut,"Niazi S, et al.

33173938,Epidemiological Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Varicella Vaccination Strategies in the United Kingdom.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the burden of varicella, there is no universal varicella vaccination (UVV) program in the United Kingdom (UK) due to concerns that it could increase herpes zoster (HZ) incidence. We assessed the cost-utility of a first-dose monovalent (varicella [V]) or quadrivalent (measles-mumps-rubella-varicella [MMRV]) followed by a second-dose MMRV UVV program. GSK and MSD varicella-containing vaccines (VCVs) were considered.
METHODS: Dynamic transmission and cost-effectiveness models were adapted to the UK. Outcomes measured included varicella and HZ incidences and the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICURs) over a lifetime horizon. Payer and societal perspectives were evaluated.
RESULTS: The impact of V-MMRV and MMRV-MMRV UVV programs on varicella incidence was comparable between both VCVs at equilibrium. HZ incidence increased by 1.6%-1.7% over 7 years after UVV start, regardless of the strategies, then decreased by >95% at equilibrium. ICURs ranged from £5665 (100 years) to £18 513 (20 years) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with V-MMRV and from £9220 to £27 101 per QALY gained with MMRV-MMRV (payer perspective). MMRV-MMRV was cost-effective in the medium- and long-terms with GSK VCV and only cost-effective in the long term with MSD VCV at a £20 000 per QALY gained threshold. Without the exogenous boosting hypothesis, HZ incidence decreased through UVV implementation. ICURs were most sensitive to discount rates and MMRV price.
CONCLUSIONS: A 2-dose UVV was demonstrated to be a cost-effective alternative to no vaccination. With comparable effectiveness as MSD VCV at lower costs, GSK VCV may offer higher value for the money.","['Akpo EIH', 'Cristeau O', 'Hunjan M', 'Casabona G']",2021,73,11,Clin Infect Dis,"Akpo EIH, et al.

33160754,Varicella-zoster-virus vaccination of immunosuppressed children with inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune hepatitis: A prospective observational study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) receiving immunosuppressive treatment are at risk for severe varicella zoster virus (VZV)-induced disease. This study evaluated vaccination of susceptible patients with stable disease and documented immunoreactivity without interruption of their current immunosuppression (IS).
METHODS: This prospective multicentre observational study used a prevaccination checklist to select patients with low-intensity and high-intensity IS for VZV vaccination. Tolerability and safety after immunization were assessed by questionnaire. The immune response was measured by the VZV-IgG concentration, relative avidity index (RAI), and specific lymphocyte proliferative response.
RESULTS: A total of 29 VZV vaccinations were performed in 17 seronegative patients aged 3-16 years (IBD n = 15, AIH n = 2). Eight patients received high-intensity immunosuppression, another six low-intensity immunosuppression, and three patients interrupted IS before VZV vaccination. All 29 vaccinations were well tolerated; only minor side effects such as fever and abdominal pain, were reported in two patients. One patient experienced a flare of Crohn's disease the day after vaccination. The VZV-IgG-concentration increased significantly (p = 0.018) after vaccination, and a specific lymphocyte response towards VZV in vitro was detected in all tested patients which correlated with the RAI (r = 0.489; p = 0.078).
CONCLUSIONS: VZV vaccination was well tolerated, safe and immunogenic in children receiving ongoing IS due to IBD and AIH. Ensuring immunoreactivity by clinical and laboratory parameters, rather than the type and dosage of IS, is a reasonable approach to decide on live-attenuated virus vaccinations in immunosuppressed children (German clinical trials DRKS00016357).","['Seitel T', 'Cagol L', 'Prelog M', 'Frivolt K', 'Krahl A', 'Trenkel S', 'Speth F', 'Mayer B', 'Almanzar G', 'Koletzko S', 'Debatin KM', 'Mertens T', 'Posovszky C']",2020,38,50,Vaccine,"Seitel T, et al.

33150393,Impact of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions on the Incidence of Respiratory Infections During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in Korea: A Nationwide Surveillance Study.,"BACKGROUND: Many countries have implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to determine whether NPIs led to the decline in the incidences of respiratory infections.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, ecological study using a nationwide notifiable diseases database and a respiratory virus sample surveillance collected from January 2016 through July 2020 in the Republic of Korea. Intervention period was defined as February-July 2020, when the government implemented NPIs nationwide. Observed incidences in the intervention period were compared with the predicted incidences by an autoregressive integrated moving average model and the 4-year mean cumulative incidences (CuIs) in the same months of the preintervention period.
RESULTS: Five infectious diseases met the inclusion criteria: chickenpox, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, and pertussis. The incidences of chickenpox and mumps during the intervention period were significantly lower than the prediction model. The CuIs (95% confidence interval) of chickenpox and mumps were 36.4% (23.9-76.3%) and 63.4% (48.0-93.3%) of the predicted values. Subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in the incidence was universal for chickenpox, while mumps showed a marginal reduction among those aged <18 years, but not in adults. The incidence of respiratory viruses was significantly lower than both the predicted incidence (19.5%; 95% confidence interval, 11.8-55.4%) and the 4-year mean CuIs in the preintervention period (24.5%; P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive summary of the hematologic, gastroenterological, renal, dermatologic, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations of COVID-19.
DISCUSSION: Hematological presentations of COVID-19 include laboratory abnormalities such as decreased total lymphocyte count, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), elevated d-dimer, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Several of these findings are associated with increased mortality among infected patients. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, presence of viral RNA in patient stool suggests the possibility of additional testing modalities for COVID-19. Nephrological findings such as proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels have been observed. Additionally, several studies demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) had a greater risk of mortality. The virus can also present with cutaneous symptoms such as erythematous rashes, urticaria, and chicken pox-like lesions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been described in the literature, and patients can exhibit findings consistent with viral encephalitis, cerebral vascular disease, peripheral nerve disorders, and psychosis.
CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 does usually present primarily with respiratory symptoms, the extra-pulmonary manifestations of the virus are unpredictable and varied. Better understanding and awareness of these symptoms can lead to more efficient diagnosis, rapid treatment, isolation, and decreased spread of the disease.","['AlSamman M', 'Caggiula A', 'Ganguli S', 'Misak M', 'Pourmand A']",2020,38,11,Am J Emerg Med,"AlSamman M, et al.

Some important developments in 2019/20 are described here: Work-related vaccination recommendations for measles, rubella, and chickenpox have been streamlined and expanded. In addition, measles vaccination or documentation of immunity is now mandatory for employment at and attendance of many institutions, specifically including day care centers and schools. Owing to the shift of pneumococcal serotypes since the introduction of conjugate vaccines the US ACIP no longer recommends these for the routine administration to healthy persons of older age.

32999816,Insights into the pathogenesis of varicella viruses.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a highly contagious, neurotropic alpha herpes virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). VZV establishes lifelong latency in the sensory ganglia from which it can reactivate to induce herpes zoster (HZ), a painful disease that primarily affects older individuals and those who are immune-suppressed. Given that VZV infection is highly specific to humans, developing a reliable 
RECENT FINDINGS: Data from recent studies suggest that infected T cells are important for viral dissemination to the cutaneous sites of infection as well as site of latency and that a viral latency-associated transcript might play a role in the transition from lytic infection to latency and then reactivation.
SUMMARY: Recent studies have provided exciting insights into mechanisms of varicelloviruses pathogenesis such as the critical role of T cells in VZV/SVV dissemination from the respiratory mucosa to the skin and the sensory ganglia; the ability of VZV/SVV to interfere with host defense; and the identification of VLT transcripts in latently infected ganglia. However, our understanding of these phenomena remains poorly understood. Therefore, it is critical that we continue to investigate host-pathogen interactions during varicelloviruses infection. These studies will lead to a deeper understanding of VZV biology as well as novel aspects of cell biology.","['Sorel O', 'Messaoudi I']",2019,6,3,Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,Sorel O and Messaoudi I.

32997550,A systematic literature review to assess the burden of herpes zoster disease in China.,"INTRODUCTION: Herpes zoster (HZ) or shingles occurs as a result of reactivation after a primary infection with varicella zoster virus (chickenpox). The burden of HZ in older adults in China is not well understood. We conducted a systematic literature review to understand the burden of disease related to HZ, its complications, and associated costs in China.
AREAS COVERED: Using publications retrieved from Chinese and English literature databases, we described incidence and prevalence of HZ, occurrence of HZ-related complications, and costs associated with HZ in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
EXPERT OPINION: The data, although limited, indicate that the burden of disease due to HZ is substantial in China, with incidence rates that are comparable to the rest of the world. Recently, an adjuvanted recombinant HZ vaccine was approved for use in China. Disease prevention is likely to reduce the burden of disease, with potentially significant economic benefits. However, understanding the public health impact of vaccination in China will require extensive baseline information about incidence, complication rates, and associated costs. This review gives an overview of available research, but also reveals existing gaps. Well-designed observational studies are needed to quantify the total burden of disease and potential impact of prevention through vaccination.","['Yin D', 'Van Oorschot D', 'Jiang N', 'Marijam A', 'Saha D', 'Wu Z', 'Tang H', 'Diaz-Decaro J', 'Watson P', 'Xie X', 'Ren Y', 'He Y', 'Feng Y']",2021,19,2,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,"Yin D, et al.

32992805,Twelve Children with Varicella Vaccine Meningitis: Neuropathogenesis of Reactivated Live Attenuated Varicella Vaccine Virus.,"Varicella vaccine is a live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Like its parental strain called VZV pOka, the vaccine virus vOka retains some neurotropic properties. To better understand vOka neuropathogenesis, we reassessed 12 published cases of vOka meningitis that occurred in once-immunized and twice-immunized children, all of whom had bouts of herpes zoster preceding the central nervous system infection. Eight of the 12 meningitis cases occurred in children who had received only one immunization. There was no pattern to the time interval between varicella vaccination and the onset of herpes zoster with meningitis. Four of the meningitis cases occurred in children who had received two immunizations. Since all four children were 14 years old when meningitis was diagnosed, there was a strong pattern to the interval between the first vaccination at age 1 year and onset of meningitis, namely, 13 years. Knowledge of pathogenesis requires knowledge of the location of herpes zoster; the majority of dermatomal rashes occurred at sites of primary immunization on the arm or thigh, while herpes zoster ophthalmicus was uncommon. Based on this literature review, currently there is no consensus as to the cause of varicella vaccine meningitis in twice-immunized children.","['Heusel EH', 'Grose C']",2020,12,10,Viruses,Heusel EH and Grose C.

32979588,Disease surveillance during a large religious mass gathering in India: The Prayagraj Kumbh 2019 experience.,"BACKGROUND: Mass gathering (MG) events are associated with public health risks. During the period January 14 to March 4, 2019, Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India was attended by an estimated 120 million visitors. An onsite disease surveillance was established to identify and respond to disease outbreaks.
METHODS: A health coordination committee was established for planning. Disease surveillance was prioritized and risk assessment was done to identify diseases/conditions based on epidemic potential, severity of illness, and reporting requirement under the International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005. A daily indicator and event-based disease surveillance was planned. The indicator-based surveillance (IBS) manually and electronically recorded data from patient hospital visits and collected MG area water testing data to assess trends. The event-based surveillance (EBS) helped identify outbreak signals based on pre-identified event triggers from the media, private health facilities, and the food safety department. Epidemic intelligence was used to analyse the data and events to detect signals, verify alerts, and initiate the response.
RESULTS: At Kumbh Mela, disease surveillance was established for 22 acute diseases/syndromes. Sixty-five health facilities reported 156 154 illnesses (21% of a total 738 526 hospital encounters). Among the reported illnesses, 95% (n = 148 834) were communicable diseases such as acute respiratory illness (n = 52 504, 5%), acute fever (n = 41 957, 28%), and skin infections (n = 27 094, 18%). The remaining 5% (n = 7300) were non-communicable diseases (injuries n = 6601, 90%; hypothermia n = 224, 3%; burns n = 210, 3%). Water samples tested inadequate for residual chlorine in 20% of samples (102/521). The incident command centre generated 12 early warning signals from IBS and EBS: acute diarrheal disease (n = 8, 66%), vector-borne disease (n = 2, 16%), vaccine-preventable disease (n = 1, 8%), and thermal event (n = 1, 8%). There were two outbreaks (acute gastroenteritis and chickenpox) that were investigated and controlled.
CONCLUSIONS: This onsite disease surveillance imparted a public health legacy by successfully implementing an epidemic intelligence enabled system for early disease detection and response to monitor public health risks. Acute respiratory illnesses emerged as a leading cause of morbidity among visitors. Future MG events should include disease surveillance as part of planning and augment capacity for acute respiratory illness diagnosis and management.","['Aggrawal V', 'Dikid T', 'Jain SK', 'Pandey A', 'Khasnobis P', 'Choudhary S', 'Chandra R', 'Patil A', 'Maramraj KK', 'Talyan A', 'Singh A', 'Babu BS', 'Kumar A', 'Kumar D', 'Raveesh PM', 'Singh J', 'Kumar R', 'Qadri SS', 'Madan P', 'Vardan V', 'Dzeyie KA', 'Gupta G', 'Mishra A', 'Vaisakh TP', 'Patel P', 'Jainul A', 'Kaur S', 'Shrivastava A', 'Dhuria M', 'Chauhan R', 'Singh SK']",2020,101,,Int J Infect Dis,"Aggrawal V, et al.

32969747,Varicella vaccination in Italy and Germany - different routes to success: a systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Italy (in pilot regions) and Germany (nationwide) were the first European countries to introduce universal varicella vaccination (UVV) programs.
AREAS COVERED: A systematic review was performed to assess varicella epidemiology before UVV programs and the impact of 1-dose and 2-dose UVV programs in Italy and Germany.
EXPERT OPINION: Italy implemented 1- or 2-dose UVV programs successively in eight pilot regions between 2003 and 2011 and nationwide in 2017. Germany implemented 1- and 2-dose UVV programs in 2004 and 2009, respectively. While Italy had two nationwide surveillance systems in place for varicella in the pre-vaccination era, in Germany, a mandatory notification system for varicella was only introduced in the New Federal States 2 years before the 1-dose UVV implementation. Substantial reductions in moderate/severe varicella and varicella-related hospitalization incidence occurred during the 1-dose era. Further reductions were reported in Italy and Germany after the recommendation of a second dose in a long or short schedule, respectively. Different benefit-risk evaluations of a tetravalent varicella-containing vaccine (MMRV) used as a first dose led to different recommendations (MMRV versus MMR+V) in these countries. Vaccination strategies in both countries tailored to country-specific needs and goals led to a reduction in varicella-related health care hospitalization costs.","['Kauffmann F', 'Bechini A', 'Bonanni P', 'Casabona G', 'Wutzler P']",2020,19,9,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Kauffmann F, et al.

32943113,Acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity with a positive cerebrospinal fluid varicella zoster PCR result creating a management dilemma: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus central nervous system infections can present as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, and vasculopathy. Diagnosis is based on identification of varicella zoster virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction. Therapy for these infections is acyclovir or valacyclovir. However, acyclovir can have neurotoxic effects that can mimic the presentation of varicella zoster virus central nervous system disease. We present a rare presentation of a patient who had acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity who also had a false-positive cerebrospinal fluid varicella zoster virus polymerase chain reaction result, creating a management dilemma. We review the clinical characteristics of acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity. In addition, we present the diagnostic characteristics of the cerebrospinal fluid viral polymerase chain reaction and alternative methods to diagnose central nervous system varicella zoster virus disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old Hispanic man with end-stage renal disease was diagnosed with cutaneous zoster at an outside facility and was started on acyclovir 4 days prior to admission. His family noted worsening confusion, agitation, speech difficulty, and hallucinations, leading them to bring him to the emergency department. His cerebrospinal fluid varicella zoster virus polymerase chain reaction result was positive, indicating the presence of varicella zoster virus deoxyribonucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid; however, he did not have cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis typical of varicella zoster virus meningoencephalitis. Pharmacy records from the outside hospital revealed supratherapeutic acyclovir dosing. This led to a diagnostic dilemma over whether this patient had varicella zoster virus encephalitis or acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity. Acyclovir was discontinued, and the patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis to remove acyclovir, which led to a full neurologic recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella zoster virus encephalitis and acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity can have similar presentations. Varicella zoster virus deoxyribonucleic acid can be present in the cerebrospinal fluid during active cutaneous zoster in the absence of central nervous system disease. If concern for central nervous system varicella zoster virus disease remains high, additional testing with cerebrospinal fluid serology can be performed. Compared with central nervous system varicella zoster virus disease, acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity has a more predictable clinical resolution once drug therapy is discontinued or the patient undergoes hemodialysis, which can aid in making the diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of this rare and dangerous complication of acyclovir. In addition, clinicians should have an understanding of the diagnostic limitations of cerebrospinal fluid viral polymerase chain reaction and have alternative approaches available to diagnose central nervous system varicella zoster virus disease when it is suspected.","['Robertson KM', 'Harvey CL', 'Cunningham JM']",2020,14,1,J Med Case Rep,"Robertson KM, et al.

32895526,Near-atomic cryo-electron microscopy structures of varicella-zoster virus capsids.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a medically important human herpesvirus that causes chickenpox and shingles, but its cell-associated nature has hindered structure studies. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of purified VZV A-capsid and C-capsid, as well as of the DNA-containing capsid inside the virion. Atomic models derived from these structures show that, despite enclosing a genome that is substantially smaller than those of other human herpesviruses, VZV has a similarly sized capsid, consisting of 955 major capsid protein (MCP), 900 small capsid protein (SCP), 640 triplex dimer (Tri2) and 320 triplex monomer (Tri1) subunits. The VZV capsid has high thermal stability, although with relatively fewer intra- and inter-capsid protein interactions and less stably associated tegument proteins compared with other human herpesviruses. Analysis with antibodies targeting the N and C termini of the VZV SCP indicates that the hexon-capping SCP-the largest among human herpesviruses-uses its N-terminal half to bridge hexon MCP subunits and possesses a C-terminal flexible half emanating from the inner rim of the upper hexon channel into the tegument layer. Correlation of these structural features and functional observations provide insights into VZV assembly and pathogenesis and should help efforts to engineer gene delivery and anticancer vectors based on the currently available VZV vaccine.","['Wang W', 'Zheng Q', 'Pan D', 'Yu H', 'Fu W', 'Liu J', 'He M', 'Zhu R', 'Cai Y', 'Huang Y', 'Zha Z', 'Chen Z', 'Ye X', 'Han J', 'Que Y', 'Wu T', 'Zhang J', 'Li S', 'Zhu H', 'Zhou ZH', 'Cheng T', 'Xia N']",2020,5,12,Nat Microbiol,"Wang W, et al.

32856043,Primary and Acquired Immunodeficiencies Associated With Severe Varicella-Zoster Virus Infections.,"BACKGROUND: Although most cases of varicella or zoster are self-limited, patients with certain immune deficiencies may develop severe or life-threatening disease.
METHODS: We studied a patient with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) central nervous system (CNS) vasculopathy and as part of the evaluation, tested his plasma for antibodies to cytokines. We reviewed the literature for cases of varicella or zoster associated with primary and acquired immunodeficiencies.
RESULTS: We found that a patient with VZV CNS vasculopathy had antibody that neutralized interferon (IFN)-α but not IFN-γ. The patient's plasma blocked phosphorylation in response to stimulation with IFN-α in healthy control peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition to acquired immunodeficiencies like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or autoantibodies to IFN, variants in specific genes have been associated with severe varicella and/or zoster. Although these genes encode proteins with very different activities, many affect IFN signaling pathways, either those that sense double-stranded RNA or cytoplasmic DNA that trigger IFN production, or those involved in activation of IFN stimulated genes in response to binding of IFN with its receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: Immune deficiencies highlight the critical role of IFN in control of VZV infections and suggest new approaches for treatment of VZV infection in patients with certain immune deficiencies.","['Ansari R', 'Rosen LB', 'Lisco A', 'Gilden D', 'Holland SM', 'Zerbe CS', 'Bonomo RA', 'Cohen JI']",2021,73,9,Clin Infect Dis,"Ansari R, et al.

32848299,Molecular characterization of the 2018 outbreak of lumpy skin disease in cattle in Upper Egypt.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Lumpy skin disease (LSD), an infectious disease of cattle, is characterized by raised nodules on the skin. Although the morbidity rate of LSD is low, it has a considerable fatality rate. Despite the annual mass vaccination of livestock with sheep pox vaccine (Veterinary Serum and Vaccine Research Institute, Egypt) enforced by Egyptian authorities, the LSD virus (LSDV) continues to circulate almost every summer. The present study aimed to discover the cause of cows naturally infected with LSDV circulating in Upper Egypt during the summer of 2018 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and to analyze their phylogenetics against reference genome sequences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We cultured LSDV in specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (SPF-ECE) and used conventional PCR to identify fusion and P32 genes, previously deposited in GenBank (MN694826, MN694827, and MN954664). Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed on these two highly conserved viral genes.
RESULTS: LSDV infection of SPF-ECE resulted in characteristic white pock lesions. PCR products were identified on 1.5% agarose gel after electrophoresis at the expected positions for the fusion and P32 genes at 472 and 587 bp, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that the two viral genes were identified from the Beni Suef and Sohag Governorates in all clinical cases and confirmed the circulation of LSDV in this outbreak. After sequencing, these genes were identical to those of the LSDV that had been identified and recorded in GenBank for the past 3 years.","['Allam AM', 'Elbayoumy MK', 'Abdel-Rahman EH', 'Hegazi AG', 'Farag TK']",2020,13,7,Vet World,"Allam AM, et al.

32840450,"Pox Parties for Grannies? Chickenpox, Exogenous Boosting, and Harmful Injustices.","Some societies tolerate or encourage high levels of chickenpox infection among children to reduce rates of shingles among older adults. This tradeoff is unethical. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes both chickenpox and shingles. After people recover from chickenpox, VZV remains in their nerve cells. If their immune systems become unable to suppress the virus, they develop shingles. According to the Exogenous Boosting Hypothesis (EBH), a person's ability to keep VZV suppressed can be 'boosted' through exposure to active chickenpox infections. We argue that even if this hypothesis were true, immunization policies that discourage routine childhood varicella vaccination in order to prevent shingles for other people are unethical. Such policies harm children and treat them as mere means for the benefit of others, and are inconsistent with how parents should treat their children and physicians should treat their patients. These policies also seem incompatible with institutional transparency.","['Malm H', 'Navin MC']",2020,20,9,Am J Bioeth,"Malm H and Navin MC. Pox Parties for Grannies?

32839511,Ten years of vaccinovigilance in Italy: an overview of the pharmacovigilance data from 2008 to 2017.,"Reporting and analysis of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) are the cornerstones of vaccine safety surveillance prompting causality assessment and signal detection. This paper describes the impact of the Italian Pharmacovigilance System of vaccines over a 10-year period (2008-2017). The reporting rate (RR) per all distributed dose was calculated. Serious AEFIs and causality assessments for fatal cases were described. The main results from signal detection were reported. During the study period, 46,430 AEFIs were reported with an overall RR of 17.2 per 100,000 distributed doses. Italy showed the highest number of reports among European countries. Only 4.4% of the reports came from citizens. Of the total, 12.7% were classified as serious with a RR over the study period of 2.20 per 100,000 distributed doses. They were mainly related to hyperpyrexia and usually had a positive outcome. Fatal outcomes were reported in 0.3% of the cases and were primarily associated with the influenza vaccine in elderly patients. None of these outcomes had a consistent causal association with the vaccination. Febrile convulsions by the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines and intussusception by the rotavirus vaccine were among the highlighted signals. The reporting rate and the analysis of serious events from 10 years support the good risk/benefit profiles of vaccines.","['Moretti F', 'Gonella L', 'Gironi S', 'Marra AR', 'Santuccio C', 'Felicetti P', 'Petronzelli F', 'Marchione P', 'Barnaba SA', 'Poli A', 'Zanoni G', 'Moretti U']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Moretti F, et al.

32823414,Epidemic retinitis and community outbreaks.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to correlate seasonal variation of epidemic retinitis (ER) with concurrent community outbreaks.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, comparative study conducted in a tertiary care eye hospital in south India. Monthly variation in number of ER cases in comparison with reported community outbreaks by Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) from 2009 to 2020 in the same region were studied. Month-wise graphs against number of patients were plotted for ER and for each community outbreak.
RESULTS: ER was diagnosed in 163 patients. Diagnosis of presumed rickettsial ER was made in 48 cases (29.44%), chikungunya in 5, dengue in 3 and typhoid in 6 cases, while in other cases the etiological diagnosis remained uncertain (n = 101). Multiple positive serological tests were seen in 6 patients (Weil Felix Test (WFT) with WIDAL in 4 and chikungunya IgM with WFT in 2 patients). Relevant reported outbreaks by IDSP were: Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) (n = 5148), Chikungunya (n = 6577), Dengue (n = 7350), Measles (n = 1422), Mumps (n = 881), Rubella (n = 288), Malaria (n = 2262), Chicken Pox (n = 2385), Typhoid (n = 597), Kyasanur Forest Disease (n = 381), Scrub Typhus (n = 13), Typhus fever (n = 4), Japanese Encephalitis (n = 15). None of the outbreak graphs pattern was identical or similar to the graph of ER. Inverse relation of the graph of dengue outbreak with ER was observed.
CONCLUSION: Inverse correlation between dengue and ER should be further studied for causation, which we believe may prove dengue as least common cause. Reporting of rickettsial outbreaks should be enhanced by undertaking statewide awareness and procurement of gold standard tests.","['Kawali A', 'Srinivasan S', 'Mahendradas P', 'Shetty B']",2020,68,9,Indian J Ophthalmol,"Kawali A, et al.

The distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was developed to assess the lag and non-linear relationship between the number of chickenpox cases and PM10 concentration adjusting for meteorological factors and other pollutants. Spatiotemporal scanning was used to detect the clustering of chickenpox cases. There was a concomitant relationship between the number of chickenpox cases and PM10 concentration, especially in the period of high PM10 concentration. DLNM results showed a nonlinear relationship between the number of chickenpox cases and PM10 concentration with the maximum effect of PM10 being lagged for 13-14 days, which was consistent with the average incubation period of chickenpox. PM10 was significantly associated with the daily number of chickenpox cases when above 300 μg/m","['Yu H', 'Wang Y', 'Peng Q', 'Shao Y', 'Duan C', 'Zhu Y', 'Dong S', 'Li C', 'Shi Y', 'Zhang N', 'Zheng Y', 'Chen Y', 'Jiang Q', 'Zhong P', 'Zhou Y']",2020,190,,Environ Res,"Yu H, et al.

32800028,[Serious adverse events associated with chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia].,"OBJECTIVE: To study the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to chemotherapy with CCCG-ALL-2015 regimen in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the risk factors for death after the SAEs.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical data of 734 children with ALL. They were treated with CCCG-ALL-2015 regimen from January 2015 to June 2019. The occurrence of SAEs during the treatment was investigated. The children with SAEs were divided into a death group with 25 children and a survival group with 31 children. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors for death after the SAEs.
RESULTS: Among the 734 children with ALL, 56 (7.6%) experienced SAEs (66 cases) after chemotherapy, among which 41 cases occurred in the stage of remission induction therapy. Of all 66 cases of SAEs, 46 (70%) were infection-related SAEs, including 25 cases of septic shock (38%), 20 cases of severe pneumonia (30%), and 1 case of severe chickenpox (2%), and 87% of the children with infection-related SAEs had neutrophil deficiency. The most common infection sites were blood and the lungs. The most common pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, fungi, and Gram-positive bacteria. There were 16 cases (24%) of hemorrhage-related SAEs, with 11 cases of gastrointestinal bleeding (17%), 4 cases of pulmonary bleeding (6%), and 1 case of intracranial bleeding (2%). Of all 734 children with ALL, 66 (9.0%) died, among whom 25 died due to SAEs. The treatment-related mortality rate was 3.4%, and infection (72%) and bleeding (24%) were the main causes of death. Severe pneumonia was an independent risk factor for treatment-related death in ALL children (OR=4.087, 95%CI: 1.161-14.384, P=0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: SAEs often occur in the stage of remission induction therapy, and infection-related SAEs are more common in ALL children accepting chemotherapy with CCCG-ALL-2015 regimen. The development of severe pneumonia suggests an increased risk for death in these children.","['Xu FL', 'Guan XM', 'Wen XH', 'Shen YL', 'Xiao JW', 'Guo YX', 'Deng MY', 'Yu J']",2020,22,8,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,"Xu FL, et al.

32762761,Hospitalization for acute cerebellitis in children affected by varicella: how much does it cost?,"BACKGROUND: Chickenpox is a highly contagious airborne disease caused by the varicella zoster virus. It is generally benign and self-limiting, but it may be responsible of life-threatening complications. Acute cerebellitis (AC) is the most common neurological complication and is associated with prolonged hospitalization in the acute phase (HAP).
AIM OF THE STUDY: To estimate the costs of AC HAP in children affected by varicella.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of a pediatric cohort hospitalized for chickenpox AC over a period of 15 years (from October 2003 to October 2018) and we analyzed acute care costs. For any patient the HAP has been calculated. The final value includes cost of hospital accommodation and management at the Pediatric and Infectious Diseases Unit. To this cost, the price of procedures (imaging, laboratory exams, medical and paramedical evaluations) and medical treatments was added.
RESULTS: In the study period, 856 children had been hospitalized for varicella. Out of them, 65 met a diagnosis of AC and were included in the study. The hospitalization length was of 10 days (range 3-20 days). The median cost of HAP for each patient was of 5366 euro, with an average annual cost of 23,252 €. The most significant part of HAP is due to the cost of hospital accommodation and management at the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, which was about € 537.78 for a single day.
DISCUSSION: Although AC post-varicella is rare, its HAP cost is not negligible resulting in substantial economic burden. Vaccination would have probably prevented varicella and AC complication, avoiding hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Financial studies are important for evaluate the cost saving in order to influence public funding decisions. Further studies are necessary to investigate the economic burden of the disease.","['Bozzola E', 'Guolo S', 'Macchiarulo G', 'Festa L', 'Spina G', 'Krzysztofiak A', 'Grandin A', 'Bozzola M', 'Raponi M', 'Villani A']",2020,46,1,Ital J Pediatr,"Bozzola E, et al.

32759893,Preventive effectiveness of varicella vaccine in healthy unexposed patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Chickenpox is an infectious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus. Varicella vaccine is conventionally used for its prevention, and its administration seeks to reduce the onset of the disease and complications associated. However, there is still controversy about its effectiveness.
METHODS: We searched in Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, conducted a meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified two systematic reviews including 16 studies overall, of which three were randomized trials. We concluded that the varicella vaccine decreases the risk of contracting the disease in the long term and probably reduces the risk of developing the disease in the short term in healthy unexposed patients. Nevertheless, the vaccination increases the occurrence of local reactions 48 hours after its administration and probably increases the presence of fever and chickenpox-like rash.","['Castro MC', 'Rojas P']",2020,20,6,Medwave,Castro MC and Rojas P.

32753151,Routine Childhood Vaccines Given From 1 through 18 Years of Age.,"In addition to the vaccines due in the first year of life, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that children continue to receive vaccines regularly against a variety of infectious diseases. Starting at 12 to 15 months of life, these include the two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccine series and the two-dose varicella vaccine series. Also in the second year of life, infants should begin the two-dose hepatitis A vaccine series and complete the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine series as well as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine series. Before 19 months of life, infants should receive the third dose of the poliovirus vaccine and the fourth dose of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. The final doses of poliovirus and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccines are both due at 4 to 6 years of life. Before each influenza season, every child should receive the influenza vaccine. Those less than 9 years of age who previously received less than two doses need two doses a month apart. At 11 to 12 years of life, all should get two doses of the human papillomavirus vaccine, the adolescent/adult version of the tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine, and begin a two-dose series of meningococcal ACWY vaccine. Each of these vaccines is due when the vaccine works to protect against both an immediate risk as well as to provide long-term protection.

32717646,Effect of prenatal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on childhood allergies and common infectious diseases in children up to age 7 years: The Hokkaido study on environment and children's health.,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used bio-accumulative chemicals in many industrial and household products. Experimental studies reported that exposure to PFAS results in immunotoxicity. We have previously reported that prenatal exposure to PFAS decreased the risk of allergies, while it increased the risk of infectious diseases at ages 2 and 4 years. However, it remains unclear whether the adverse effects of PFAS on allergies and infectious diseases continue until a reliable age of diagnosing allergies. This study aimed at investigating the effects of prenatal exposure to PFAS on the prevalence of allergies and infectious diseases in children up to age 7, from the Hokkaido Study. Among mother-child pairs enrolled in the Hokkaido study and followed up until the age of 7 years, 2689 participants with maternal PFAS, 1st trimester of pregnancy and 7-year-old questionnaire survey data were included in this study. Eleven PFAS in the 3rd-trimester plasma were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Wheeze, rhino-conjunctivitis, and eczema were defined using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies on Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. History childhood infectious diseases diagnosed by a doctor was assessed by a mother-reported questionnaire at child's age 7. The relative risk of childhood allergies was calculated by generalized estimating equation models. The odds ratio of an episode of infectious diseases was calculated by logistic regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders. The prevalence of various allergies and infectious diseases was: wheeze, 11.9%; rhino-conjunctivitis, 11.3%; eczema, 21.0%; chickenpox, 61.5%; otitis media, 55.7%; pneumonia, 30.6%; and respiratory syncytial virus infection, 16.8%. Prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) was inversely associated with rhino-conjunctivitis, while that for perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFUnDA, perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), and perfluorotridecanoic acid was inversely associated with eczema. For infectious diseases, PFDA and PFDoDA were associated with increased risk of pneumonia and PFOA was associated with increased risk of RSV infection among children not having any siblings (only-one-child). Our results corroborate the hypothesis on immunosuppressive and immunomodulating effects of PFAS on allergies and infectious diseases in children. These effects observed previously at 2 and 4 years continued until the age of 7 years. However, additional studies assessing inflammatory biomarkers along with ISAAC questionnaires, doctor-diagnosed allergies, and longer follow-ups are necessary to better assess the effects of exposure to chemicals on human immune outcomes.","['Ait Bamai Y', 'Goudarzi H', 'Araki A', 'Okada E', 'Kashino I', 'Miyashita C', 'Kishi R']",2020,143,,Environ Int,"Ait Bamai Y, et al.

Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox disease in children, teens, and young adults. Typically, it runs its course and stays dormant in nerve tissue, which can get reactivated in elderly, immunocompromised patients. Frequently, reactivation results in the painful dermatomal rash of herpes zoster, but in sporadic cases, it can cause meningitis or encephalitis in the immunocompromised population. Our case demonstrates a healthy immunocompetent adult male who presented with headache, fever, mild neck stiffness, and painless right-sided abdominal skin rash and was later diagnosed with VZV meningitis via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We are reporting this case due to its rarity, and the challenging nature of its diagnosis and treatment. In the hospital, he was treated with IV acyclovir for three days and discharged home on 14 days of oral valacyclovir. Our case demonstrates the importance of having a high degree of suspicion, even if the presentation is unexpected and atypical.","['Alataby H', 'Gautam R', 'Yuan M', 'Nfonoyim J']",2020,12,6,Cureus,"Alataby H, et al.

32711690,"Epidemiology of varicella among immigrants and non-immigrants in Quebec, Canada, before and after the introduction of childhood varicella vaccination: a retrospective cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Many immigrants are susceptible to varicella on arrival to Canada because of different transmission dynamics in their countries of origin and scarcity of vaccination. Universal childhood vaccination programmes decrease varicella incidence rates through herd immunity, but the accumulating number of susceptible adult immigrants could remain at risk for severe varicella. Our aim was to describe the epidemiology of varicella among immigrants and non-immigrants before and after childhood varicella vaccination.
METHODS: We did a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all varicella cases in Quebec, Canada, diagnosed between 1996 and 2014 in administrative health databases linked to immigration data. Cases of varicella met diagnostic codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision Canadian modifications. Cases with a co-occurring zoster diagnostic code and immigrants from Australia, New Zealand, the USA, and western European countries were excluded. Vaccination periods included pre-vaccination (1996-98), private vaccination (1999-2005), and public vaccination (2006-14). Incidence rate and comparative rate ratios were estimated using census data.
FINDINGS: A total of 231 339 varicella cases diagnosed between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2014, were linked to 1 115 696 immigrants who arrived between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2014. 1444 herpes zoster cases and 1276 immigrants from Australia, western Europe, New Zealand, and the USA were excluded. Among 228 619 varicella cases, 13 315 (5·8%) occurred in immigrants. In pre-vaccination versus public vaccination periods, varicella incidence declined in immigrants by 87% (95% CI 86·6-87·9; 324·3 cases per 100 000 person-years to 40·9 cases per 100 000 person-years) and in non-immigrants by 93% (92·4-92·7; 484 cases per 100 000 person-years to 36 cases per 100 000 person-years). Mean age at diagnosis increased in both groups (15·1 vs 19·4 years in immigrants and 8·4 vs 12·0 years in non-immigrants). In the public vaccination period, immigrants younger than 50 years had higher varicella rates than non-immigrants, with relative risk ranging from 1·53 (95% CI 1·37-1·72) to 4·64 (3·90-5·53) with the highest risk in adolescents and young adults, and people from Latin America and the Caribbean (age-specific incidence rate ratio [aIRR]
INTERPRETATION: Immigrant adolescents, young adults, and women of childbearing age had higher age-standardised rates of varicella than non-immigrants, with increasing disparities following vaccine introduction. Immigrants younger than 50 years of age would benefit from targeted vaccination upon arrival to host countries.

32703324,Childhood infectious diseases and old age cognitive functioning: a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Cumulative evidence suggests that health-related risk factors during midlife and old-age are associated with cognitive impairment. However, studies are needed to clarify the association between early-life risk factors and impaired cognitive functioning to increment existing knowledge.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between childhood infectious diseases and late-life cognitive functioning in a nationally representative sample of older adults.
PARTICIPANTS: Eligible respondents were 2994 community-dwelling individuals aged 65-85.
MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Childhood infectious diseases (i.e. chicken pox, measles, and mumps) were self-reported. The study covariates were age, sex, highest educational level achieved, smoking status, body mass index, and depression. The primary statistical analysis examined the association between the number of childhood infectious diseases and total MMSE scores, accounting for all study covariates. Regression models of progressive complexity were examined for parsimony. The robustness of the primary results was tested in 17 sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The most parsimonious model was a linear adjusted model (Bayesian Information Criterion = 12646.09). Late-life cognitive functioning significantly improved as the number of childhood infectious diseases increased (β = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.11, 0.26; p < 0.001). This effect was not significantly attenuated in all sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: The current study results are consistent with prior ecological findings indicating that some childhood infectious diseases are associated with better cognitive functioning in old-age. This points to an early-life modifiable risk factor associated with older-life cognitive functioning. Our results may reflect selective mortality and/or beneficial effects via hormetic processes.","['Rotstein A', 'Levine SZ']",2021,33,1,Int Psychogeriatr,Rotstein A and Levine SZ.

We had the opportunity to examine the clinical and histopathological features of several patients who were divided into 3 groups. The first group included 8 COVID-19-positive patients who were hospitalized and quarantined at home. The second group included children and young adults who presented with chilblain erythema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria-like lesions. This group of patients was negative for the COVID-19 gene sequences by polymerase chain reaction but had a high risk of COVID-19 infection. The third group included clinically heterogeneous and challenging lesions. These patients were not subject to either polymerase chain reaction tests or serological analyses because they sought dermatological attention only for a dermatosis. The histopathological analysis of these cases showed a wide spectrum of histopathological patterns. What appears to be constant in all skin biopsies was the presence of prominent dilated blood vessels with a swollen endothelial layer, vessels engulfed with red blood cells, and perivascular infiltrates, consisting mainly of cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes and eosinophils. In 2 cases, there was diffuse coagulopathy in the cutaneous vascular plexus. In the early phases of the disease, there were numerous collections of Langerhans cells in the epidermis after being activated by the virus. The presence of urticarial lesions, chilblains, targetoid lesions (erythema multiforme-like lesions), exanthema, maculohemorrhagic rash, or chickenpox-like lesions associated with the histopathological features mentioned previously should cause clinical dermatologists to suspect the possibility of COVID-19 infection, especially in patients with fever and cough.","['Gianotti R', 'Recalcati S', 'Fantini F', 'Riva C', 'Milani M', 'Dainese E', 'Boggio F']",2020,42,8,Am J Dermatopathol,"Gianotti R, et al.

VZV infection is usually self-limited but disseminated infection can be seen in immunocompromised individuals. It can also get complicated by central nervous system (CNS) involvement. We describe a case of a 51-year-old male with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who presented with altered mental status and deficits in his right-sided cranial nerves of VI, VII, and VIII. The patient also had disseminated vesicular-pustular rash all over his body at different stages of healing. A diagnosis of disseminated VZV infection complicated by encephalitis and Ramsay Hunt syndrome was made and the patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir and oral prednisone with a rapid improvement.

32677551,Varicella Vaccine Meningitis as a Complication of Herpes Zoster in Twice-Immunized Immunocompetent Adolescents.,"Varicella-zoster virus vaccination is recommended for virtually all young children in the United States, Canada, and several other countries. Varicella vaccine is a live attenuated virus that retains some of its neurotropic properties. Herpes zoster caused by vaccine virus still occurs in immunized children, although the rate is much lower than in children who had wild-type varicella. It was commonly thought that 2 varicella vaccinations would protect children against the most serious complication of meningitis following herpes zoster; however, 2 meningitis cases have already been published. We now report a third case of varicella vaccine meningitis and define risk factors shared by all 3 immunized adolescents. The diagnosis in cerebrospinal fluid in this third case was verified by amplifying and sequencing portions of the viral genome, to document fixed alleles found only in the vaccine strain. Viral antibody was also detected in the cerebrospinal fluid by confocal microscopy. When compared with the other 2 cases, remarkably all 3 were 14 years old when meningitis occurred. All 3 were treated with intravenous acyclovir, with complete recovery. The adolescent in our case report also had recurrent asthma, which was treated with both prednisone tablets and beclomethasone inhaler before onset of meningitis. When the 3 cases were considered together, they suggested that immunity to varicella-zoster virus may be waning sufficiently in some twice-immunized adolescents to make them vulnerable to varicella vaccine virus reactivation and subsequent meningitis. This complication rarely happens in children after wild-type varicella.","['Ramachandran V', 'Elliott SC', 'Rogers KL', 'Cohrs RJ', 'Weinberger M', 'Jackson W', 'Carpenter JE', 'Grose C', 'Bonthius DJ']",2020,35,13,J Child Neurol,"Ramachandran V, et al.

32649716,Varicella zoster virus encodes a viral decoy RHIM to inhibit cell death.,"Herpesviruses are known to encode a number of inhibitors of host cell death, including RIP Homotypic Interaction Motif (RHIM)-containing proteins. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the alphaherpesvirus subfamily and is responsible for causing chickenpox and shingles. We have identified a novel viral RHIM in the VZV capsid triplex protein, open reading frame (ORF) 20, that acts as a host cell death inhibitor. Like the human cellular RHIMs in RIPK1 and RIPK3 that stabilise the necrosome in TNF-induced necroptosis, and the viral RHIM in M45 from murine cytomegalovirus that inhibits cell death, the ORF20 RHIM is capable of forming fibrillar functional amyloid complexes. Notably, the ORF20 RHIM forms hybrid amyloid complexes with human ZBP1, a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acid. Although VZV can inhibit TNF-induced necroptosis, the ORF20 RHIM does not appear to be responsible for this inhibition. In contrast, the ZBP1 pathway is identified as important for VZV infection. Mutation of the ORF20 RHIM renders the virus incapable of efficient spread in ZBP1-expressing HT-29 cells, an effect which can be reversed by the inhibition of caspases. Therefore we conclude that the VZV ORF20 RHIM is important for preventing ZBP1-driven apoptosis during VZV infection, and propose that it mediates this effect by sequestering ZBP1 into decoy amyloid assemblies.","['Steain M', 'Baker MODG', 'Pham CLL', 'Shanmugam N', 'Gambin Y', 'Sierecki E', 'McSharry BP', 'Avdic S', 'Slobedman B', 'Sunde M', 'Abendroth A']",2020,16,7,PLoS Pathog,"Steain M, et al.

32643520,Seroprevalence survey for Varicella among healthcare workers and medical students in Italy.,"Varicella is a potentially serious infectious disease caused by Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). In Italy childhood varicella vaccine have gradually introduced into national immunization program since 2003 and from 2017 a two-doses schedule has been stated nationally for all newborns and has become compulsory for school attendance. VZV exposures among healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients can be really dangerous and expensive. According to Centers of Disease Control and Italian national immunization plan health care, institutions should verify that all HCWs have clear evidence of immunity to VZV and should ensure that susceptible subjects will receive 2 doses of VZV vaccine. Currently, the vaccination of HCWs is not compulsory in Italy and the risk of varicella infection among these subjects is not well known. We evaluated the clinical records of 840 HCWs (256 male and 584 female) who underwent the annual occupational screening, from 1st January to 31st August 2018. HCWs were divided into three subgroups according to their age: 18-30, 31-40, and over 40 years old. We compared the mean values of IgG-specific antibodies between the age group through analysis of variance (ANOVA). A total of 784 (93.33%) HCWs were protected for VZV IgG antibodies level.

At 18-month age, the patient received Hepatitis A intramuscularly and Varicella Zoster Virus subcutaneously with 2 weeks interval and FVIII infusion was given <24 h prior for each. Successive bleedings occurred 1 week later with inefficacy of FVIII replacement. High-titre inhibitor was tested at 117 exposure days. This case suggested that continuous vaccinations in close proximity to FVIII could induce inhibitor.

32606844,The Cost-Effectiveness of Universal Varicella Vaccination in Italy: A Model-Based Assessment of Vaccination Strategies.,"BACKGROUND: In 2017, varicella vaccination became mandatory for all children in Italy, based on a two-dose schedule administered at 12-15 months of age and 5 to 6 years of age. Varicella vaccines are available in different formulations (as a single vaccine or as a combination vaccine together with measles, mumps, and rubella) and are made by multiple manufacturers with different effectiveness profiles. This study calculates the cost-effectiveness of a range of varicella vaccination strategies to identify the optimal strategy for Italy.
METHODS: A dynamic transmission cost-effectiveness model was applied in Italy to simulate the long-term (50 years) costs and outcomes associated with different varicella vaccination strategies. Five vaccination strategies were evaluated using the model: two doses of two different combination Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella vaccines (either Vaccine A (MSD) [denoted QQVa] or Vaccine B (GSK) [denoted QQVb]); a first dose of a single Varicella vaccine followed by a second dose of a combination vaccine (either Vaccine C (MSD) followed by Vaccine A [denoted MQVa] or Vaccine D (GSK) followed by Vaccine B [denoted MQVb]); or no vaccine at all (NV). The model was adapted for Italy using publicly available Italian data and expert opinion.
RESULTS: Over the 50-year time-horizon, in the absence of universal varicella vaccination, there would be 34.8 million varicella cases, 142 varicella-infection-related deaths, and €23 billion in societal costs. The cost per capita from a societal perspective ranged from €164.55 to €392.18 with NV being the most expensive and QQVa the least expensive. The most effective strategy was QQVa, which resulted in a 66% decrease in varicella cases and 30% reduction in varicella-related deaths compared to NV strategy. QQVa led to a net saving in societal cost around €13 billion compared to NV as the cost of vaccination was more than offset by the savings that resulted from the reduced burden of illness.
CONCLUSION: Varicella vaccination has a major impact on reducing varicella incidence, prevalence, and societal costs. This analysis supports the policy for universal varicella vaccination in Italy as the NV strategy was the most expensive and resulted in the poorest outcomes. QQVa offers the greatest benefits at the lowest cost and should be considered as a potential priority strategy for Italian population.","['Azzari C', 'Baldo V', 'Giuffrida S', 'Gani R', ""O'Brien E"", 'Alimenti C', 'Daniels VJ', 'Wolfson LJ']",2020,12,,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,"Azzari C, et al.

32599468,Mitoxantrone in relapsing-remitting and rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis: Ten-year clinical outcomes post-treatment with mitoxantrone.,"BACKGROUND: Mitoxantrone (MTX) has been used as an effective disease modifying treatment (DMT) in multiple sclerosis (MS). Evidence from studies demonstrates benefits of reduced relapse rates, MRI disease activity and disability progression in patients treated with MTX. While effective, MTX use has been limited due to potential adverse effects (AE) ranging from mild to potentially life-threatening AEs such as cardiotoxicity, bone marrow suppression and hematological malignancies. In this study we aimed to review the long-term clinical efficacy, tolerability, and AE profile of treatment with MTX in patients both with relapsing-remitting and rapidly progressive MS over a 10-year follow-up period.
METHODS: We collected prospective data of 70 patients with relapsing-remitting and rapidly progressive MS treated with MTX and followed-up over a 10-year period. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores and annualized relapse rates (ARR) were assessed 1 year prior to MTX treatment, and at different time points (1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years) during follow-up. We recorded the time to first relapse and 0.5-point EDSS increase to assess efficacy. We also obtained frequency data on AEs and patients withdrawn from treatment.
RESULTS: 70 patients were started on treatment with MTX with 53 patients (34 relapsing-remitting MS, 19 progressive disease) completing the course. Mean EDSS progressed from 5.5 to 6.5 in the relapsing-remitting group and 6.7 to 9.0 in the progressive group over the study period. ARR in the RRMS group reduced at all time points from 2.2 prior to MTX to 0.3 by year 10. We reported 3 significant AEs, one chicken pox and subsequent acute promyelocytic leukemia, one left ventricular systolic dysfunction, one pancytopenia. The commonest AE reported was nausea/vomiting in 28 (40%) patients. Seventeen patients (5 relapsing-remitting, 12 progressive disease) stopped treatment. In fifteen (87%) of these this was due to lack of efficacy. In the remaining 2 patients, MTX was stopped due to one patient developing chicken pox and the other developing first-degree heart block.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that MTX is an effective disease modifying treatment for relapsing-remitting MS with a well-established risk profile. While MTX is now used less frequently, many MS and neurology services continue to follow-up patients who have been treated with MTX previously. Therefore, understanding the long-term effects risks and benefits remains relevant in this patient group. MTX is also a low-cost treatment in comparison to other high efficacy MS disease-modifying treatments and this may be beneficial in low resource settings.","['Foo EC', 'Russell M', 'Lily O', 'Ford HL']",2020,44,,Mult Scler Relat Disord,"Foo EC, et al.

32586930,"Stop, think SCORTCH: rethinking the traditional 'TORCH' screen in an era of re-emerging syphilis.","BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of congenital infections is ever changing, with a recent resurgence in syphilis infection rates seen in the UK. Identification of congenital infection is often delayed; early recognition and management of congenital infections is important. Testing modalities and investigations are often limited, leading to missed diagnostic opportunities.
METHODS: The SCORTCH (syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), 'other', rubella, toxoplasmosis, chickenpox, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and blood-borne viruses) acronym increases the awareness of clinicians to the increased risk of congenital syphilis, while considering other infectious aetiologies including: zika, malaria, chagas disease, parvovirus, enterovirus, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and human T-lymphotropic virus 1, in addition to the classic congenital infections recognised in the 'TORCH screen' (toxoplasmosis, 'other', rubella, CMV, HSV). The SCORTCH diagnostic approach describes common signs present in infants with congenital infection, details serological testing for mother and infant and important direct diagnostics of the infant. Direct diagnostic investigations include: radiology, ophthalmology, audiology, microbiological and PCR testing for both the infant and placental tissue, the latter also warrants histopathology.
CONCLUSION: The traditional 'TORCH screen' focuses on serology-specific investigations, often omits important direct diagnostic testing of the infant, and fails to consider emerging and re-emerging congenital infections. In recognition of syphilis as a re-emerging pathogen and the overlapping clinical presentations of various infectious aetiologies, we advocate for a broader outlook using the SCORTCH diagnostic approach.","['Penner J', 'Hernstadt H', 'Burns JE', 'Randell P', 'Lyall H']",2021,106,2,Arch Dis Child,"Penner J, et al.

Compared to healthy human plasma, we found 44 differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of HZ patients, the main pathways involved in these molecules are MAPK signaling pathway, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Acute myeloid leukemia, Transcriptional misregulation in cancer. We found that 27 proteins have direct protein-protein interactions. Based on the comprehensive score, we identified six key molecules as candidate molecules for further study, and then validated another 80 plasma samples (40 HZ patient plasma and 40 healthy human plasma) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot assay and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Finally, we found that the expression levels of these three proteins (PLG, F2, VTN) were significantly lower than those of healthy controls (P < .05). To the best of our knowledge, we first used tandem mass tag (TMT) combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to screen for differentially expressed proteins in plasma between HZ patients and healthy individuals. It is preliminarily proved that the plasma protein expression profile of HZ patients is different from that of uninfected patients, it has also been found that these three altered key proteins may be used as biomarkers to test early HZ infection. This study reveals new insights into HZ that help to more accurately identify early HZ patients and to find new therapeutic targets. SIGNIFICANCE: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV; termed human alphaherpesvirus 3 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) is a herpesvirus that is ubiquitous in humans and can cause chickenpox and herpes zoster (HZ). After the initial infection of varicella, the VZV goes into a dormant state in the sensory ganglia and cranial nerves. As age or immunosuppression increases, the cellular immunity to VZV decreases, and the virus reactivates and spreads along the sensory nerves to the skin, causing a unique prodromal pain followed by a rash. About one in five people around the world may be infected with VZV at some point in their lives. According to statistics, about one-third of infected people will develop HZ in their lifetime, and an estimated 1 million cases of herpes zoster occur in the United States each year. Herpes zoster can occur at any age and is usually less severe in children and young adults, but the greatest morbidity and mortality are observed in elderly and immunocompromised patients. 20% of patients with HZ have complications including vasculitis, increased risk of myocardial infarction, or postherpetic neuralgia, the overall mortality rate of patients with HZ in the United States is close to 5%. Considering the wide clinical severity and complications of this disease, there is a great need for biomarkers that contribute to early diagnosis, classification of risks, and prediction of outcomes, which will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying their clinical development. As a useful tool in biology, quantitative proteomics can repeatedly identify and accurately quantify proteins in a variety of biological samples. Proteomic analysis focuses on translational proteins, which play a direct role in most biological processes. Although a small number of proteins can be studied simultaneously with traditional methods, such as ELISA and Western blotting, typical proteomics studies can simultaneously analyze thousands of proteins for a more comprehensive identification. Proteomics has been successfully applied to human-based disease research, Analysis of exposed and unexposed subjects based on mass spectrometry (MS) has been found to reveal altered expression of proteins that can be identified as intermediate biomarkers of early disease effects. Tandem mass tags (TMTs) are chemical labels used for MS-based identification and quantification of biological molecules. TMTs play an important role in proteomic analysis in a variety of samples such as cells, tissues, and body fluids. The body fluids that are often detected clinically are blood, which are easy to obtain and contain abundant biological information related to physiological and pathological processes, we hope to develop protein biomarkers from these blood. Therefore, in order to better characterize the pathological process of HZ patients, we performed proteomic analysis of HZ patients and healthy human plasma using the TMT method. This comparison aims to identify specific processes in the development of HZ disease through protein profiling, which may help to improve our biological understanding of HZ.","['Wang T', 'Shen H', 'Deng H', 'Pan H', 'He Q', 'Ni H', 'Tao J', 'Liu S', 'Xu L', 'Yao M']",2020,225,,J Proteomics,"Wang T, et al.

32571587,[Benefits and risks of ibuprofen in children with fever: Overview of the literature with a view to producing a written information tool for parents].,"Drug information, as it appears in package leaflet, lacks relevant encrypted data for the patient. The aim of our research was to propose a written model of drug information inspired from the concept of the ""Drug Facts Box"", about ibuprofen in children with fever. To this end, we carried out a systematic review of systematic literature reviews (""overview"") to look for data on the benefits and risks of ibuprofen compared to placebo, paracetamol or a treatment alternating or combining paracetamol and ibuprofen in children with fever aged 0-18 years. 9 systematic reviews were included from the Pubmed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases. 1 clinical practice guideline and 2 documents published by the French Haute Autorité de santé (HAS) and the French Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM) were also included. Paracetamol and ibuprofen have a comparable efficacy and safety profile in children with fever. A low increased risk of adverse reactions to ibuprofen is to be feared in specifics clinical situations (chicken pox, pneumonia, angina). Treatments alternating or combining paracetamol and ibuprofen can further lower the temperature compared to paracetamol or ibuprofen alone, but there is no evidence of improved child comfort. The limited data available on the adverse effects of these treatment regimens suggests that they should not be routinely recommended. There is little evidence of the comfort of the febrile child even though it is the primary objective of antipyretic treatment.","['Faisantieu N', 'Kowalski V', 'Soulié B']",2020,75,6,Therapie,"Faisantieu N, et al.

32564061,"Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella Zoster Virus Serology and Infections in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients During the First Year Posttransplantation.","BACKGROUND: Mumps, measles, rubella, and varicella zoster (MMRV) viruses may cause severe infections in seronegative adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, but can be prevented by vaccination. We aimed to determine MMRV serostatus in adult SOT recipients before and 1 year after transplantation as well as evidence of MMRV infections in a large, prospective cohort of SOT recipients.
METHODS: This was a prospective study of 1182 adult SOT recipients included in the Management of Posttransplant Infections in Collaborating Hospitals (MATCH) cohort from 2011 to 2017 with a 1-year follow-up. Systematic monitoring of MMRV serology was performed prior to transplantation and 1 year posttransplantation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm viral replication in SOT recipients presenting with clinical evidence of infection.
RESULTS: Among 1182 adult SOT recipients, 28 (2.4%), 77 (6.5%), 65 (5.5%), and 22 (1.9%) were seronegative for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella zoster virus (VZV), respectively, and 165 (14%) were seronegative for at least 1 of the MMRV viruses. One year posttransplantation, 29 of 823 (3.5%) of seropositive SOT recipients had seroreverted, and 63 of 111 (57%) of seronegative SOT recipients seroconverted for at least 1 MMRV virus. No evidence of measles, mumps, or rubella infection was found, but 8 (0.7%) SOT recipients developed symptoms and had a positive VZV PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of SOT recipients were seronegative for at least 1 of the MMRV viruses. MMRV infections in SOT recipients may disseminate and become fatal, and although only a few cases of VZV infection were detected, results from this study suggest increase attention toward vaccination of patients waiting for SOT.","['Rezahosseini O', 'Sørensen SS', 'Perch M', 'Ekenberg C', 'Møller DL', 'Knudsen AD', 'Kirkby N', 'Lundgren J', 'Lodding IP', 'Wareham NE', 'Gustafsson F', 'Rasmussen A', 'Nielsen SD']",2021,73,11,Clin Infect Dis,"Rezahosseini O, et al.

32559324,Unraveling the mystery of Covid-19 cytokine storm: From skin to organ systems.,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that emerged from Wuhan, China. Besides pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the disease leads to multisystem involvement in the form of myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoxemic brain injury, acute liver, and renal function impairment. There are also reports of cutaneous lesions in form of urticarial and maculopapular rashes, chilblain like fingers and toes (covid feet), livedoid vasculopathy, and chicken-pox like or varicelliform vesicles. Clinically, many of these skin lesions are likely secondary to occlusion of small to medium blood vessels due to microthrombi formation or due to viral laden antigen-antibody immune complexes; and same explanation may hold true for possible hypoxemic injury simultaneously occurring in other vital organs like lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. The histopathology, immunoflorescence and RT-PCR analysis of skin biopsies can provide useful insights for ascertaining the pathogenesis of this complex viral syndrome. Apparently, it is interplay of disarmed cellular immunity and over-activated humoral immunity that culminates in end-organ changes. The morbidity and mortality can be significantly reduced by upgrading the cellular immunity and downgrading the humoral response; along with prevention of hypoxemic and reperfusion injuries by using antivirals, immunomodulators, antioxidants, anti-platelets, and anticoagulants in judicious and phased manner.","['Garg S', 'Garg M', 'Prabhakar N', 'Malhotra P', 'Agarwal R']",2020,33,6,Dermatol Ther,"Garg S, et al.

32546413,Attitudes towards varicella vaccination in parents and paediatric healthcare providers in Hungary.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella vaccination is important in prevention of childhood infection. Aim of this cross-sectional study was to survey attitudes and determinants of support or refusal of varicella vaccination in parents and in paediatric healthcare professionals, mainly health visitors in Hungary prior to the introduction of this vaccine in National Immunization Program in 2019.
METHODS: Between October 2018 and February 2019, 1042 parents and 198 healthcare professionals completed a self-administered anonymous questionnaire regarding sociodemographic background, knowledge and attitudes towards varicella vaccination, and reasons for non-vaccination.
RESULTS: From the participating parents 53.3% have vaccinated at least one of their children. Vaccination rate was significantly higher in families with <3 children, living in the capital, among those who have seen complications of varicella and among parents with university degree. Most important positive determinant was recommendation of the vaccine by healthcare professionals: 77.8% of parents accepted vaccination when recommended by the paediatrician, despite the cost of the vaccine, whereas only 17.3% of parents vaccinated their children when the vaccine was not recommended by paediatrician. Most important reasons for non-vaccination was finding the vaccine unnecessary, concerns regarding side effects, and not believing in the vaccine's effectiveness. Among paediatric healthcare professionals, support rate of universal varicella vaccination was 76.3%. Support rate was higher among those who have seen complications of varicella more often and those who consider varicella a severe infection. Reasons of professionals who do not support universal varicella vaccination were similar to those of vaccine hesitant parents. Practice of intentional exposure of non-immune child to infected ones still exist.
CONCLUSIONS: Educational programs are needed for parents and health visitors to address concerns regarding vaccination. Paediatricians are the most trusted source of information for parents hence they have a significant responsibility and parents likely follow their recommendations.","['Huber A', 'Gazder J', 'Dobay O', 'Mészner Z', 'Horváth A']",2020,38,33,Vaccine,"Huber A, et al.

An epidemiological study was undertaken in order to determine the characteristics of the outbreak, assess vaccine effectiveness, and examine risk factors for vaccine failure.
METHODS: A varicella case was defined as a generalized papulovesicular rash (without other apparent causes) in a child without prior varicella attending the kindergarten during February 22 to April 7 of 2016. Varicella among vaccinated children (breakthrough varicella) was defined as varicella occurring >42 days after vaccination. Children's vaccination status was verified with immunization records through local vaccination information platform.
RESULTS: Of the 738 children, 664 (90.0%) had no prior varicella history. Of these, 364 (54.8%) had received a single-dose varicella vaccine before outbreak.

32447713,Vaccine Hesitancy as a Challenge or Vaccine Confidence as an Opportunity for Childhood Immunisation in India.,"Vaccines have contributed substantially to decreasing the morbidity and mortality rates of many infectious diseases worldwide. Despite this achievement, an increasing number of parents have adopted hesitant behaviours towards vaccines, delaying or even refusing their administration to children. This has implications not only on individuals but also society in the form of outbreaks for e.g. measles, chicken pox, hepatitis A, etc. A review of the literature was conducted to identify the determinants of vaccine hesitancy (VH) as well as vaccine confidence and link them to challenges and opportunities associated with vaccination in India, safety concerns, doubts about the need for vaccines against uncommon diseases and suspicions towards new vaccines were identified as major vaccine-specific factors of VH. Lack of awareness and limited access to vaccination sites were often reported by hesitant parents. Lastly, socio-economic level, educational level and cultural specificities were contextual factors of VH in India. Controversies and rumours around some vaccines (e.g., human papillomavirus) have profoundly impacted the perception of the risks and benefits of vaccination. Challenges posed by traditions and cultural behaviours, geographical specificities, socio-demographic disparities, the healthcare system and vaccine-specific features are highlighted, and opportunities to improve confidence are identified. To overcome VH and promote vaccination, emphasis should be on improving communication, educating the new generation and creating awareness among the society. Tailoring immunisation programmes as per the needs of specific geographical areas or communities is also important to improve vaccine confidence.

We examined whether pediatric herpes zoster (HZ) incidence varied by pattern of varicella vaccine administration.
METHODS: In six integrated health systems, we examined HZ incidence among children turning 12 months old during 2003-2008. All received varicella and MMR vaccines on recommended schedules. Cases were identified through 2014 using ICD-9 codes. Incidence was examined by number of varicella vaccine doses and same-day MMR.
RESULTS: Among 199,797 children, overall HZ incidence was 18.6/100,000 person-years in the first-dose MMR + VAR group, 17.9/100,000 person-years in the MMRV group, and 7.5/100,000 person-years in the VAR-alone group.

There are significant risks in such patients of developing opportunistic infections or re-activation of latent infections, with higher associated morbidity and mortality. The aim of this quality improvement project was to determine how effective 5 different specialties were in assessing and mitigating risks of developing opportunistic infections or re-activation of latent infections in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapies.
METHODS: This was a single centre audit where records of patients attending clinics providing immunosuppressive therapies were reviewed for the following: evidence of screening for blood-borne virus [BBV] infections, varicella and measles immunity, latent/active TB or hypogammaglobulinaemia, and whether appropriate vaccines had been advised or various infection risks discussed. These assessments were audited against both national and international guidelines, or a cross-specialty consensus guideline where specific recommendations were lacking. Two sub-populations were also analysed separately: patients receiving more potent immunosuppression and black and minority ethnic [BME] patients,.
RESULTS: For the 204 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, BBV, varicella/measles and latent TB screening was inconsistent, as was advice for vaccinations, with few areas complying with specialty or consensus guidelines. Less than 10% of patients in one specialty were tested for HIV. In BME patients screening for HIV [60%], measles [0%] and varicella [40%] immunity and latent [30%] or active [20%] TB was low. Only 38% of patients receiving potent immunosuppression received Pneumocystis prophylaxis, with 3 of 4 specialties providing less than 15% of patients in this category with prophylaxis.
CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with guidelines to mitigate risks of infection from immunosuppressive therapies was either inconsistent or poor for most specialties. New approaches to highlight such risks and assist appropriate pre-immunosuppression screening are needed.","['Chadwick DR', 'Sayeed L', 'Rose M', 'Budd E', 'Mohammed M', 'Harrison S', 'Azad J', 'Maddox J']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Chadwick DR, et al.

32401599,Identification and description of mumps cases in a non-outbreak setting and evaluation of the effectiveness of mumps-containing vaccines over time.,"Mumps outbreaks among previously vaccinated young adults raise concerns regarding waning vaccine immunity. This study identified, described and assessed the changing incidence of mumps cases following mumps-containing vaccination (MMR/MMRV) in a non-mumps outbreak setting. Potential cases between 1996 and 2018 were identified by the international classification of disease codes or by mumps laboratory test orders among Kaiser Permanente Northern California members. Medical charts were reviewed to confirm diagnoses, timing relative to vaccination and clinical characteristics. Among 474 potential cases, 257 (54.2%) were confirmed after chart review. A third of the cases were <10 years old at diagnosis and 48% were over 25 years. Most cases (92.2%) had parotitis and 5% of males had orchitis. Mumps rates decreased from 8.5 to 1.8/1,000,000 person-years as time since the second MMR/MMRV dose increased from <2 years to ≥10 years. Similarly, rates decreased from 16.3 to 3/1,000,000 person-years after at least 1 dose of MMR/MMRV. Mumps rates were higher among children aged ≤10 years compared with older age groups. In conclusion, in the context of a non-outbreak setting, this study suggests that waning of vaccine immunity to mumps appeared to have minimal clinical impact.","['Zerbo O', 'Modaressi S', 'Glanternik JR', 'Goddard K', 'Ross P', 'Lewis N', 'Klein NP']",2020,16,12,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Zerbo O, et al.

32379767,A Bayesian unified framework for risk estimation and cluster identification in small area health data analysis.,"Many statistical models have been proposed to analyse small area disease data with the aim of describing spatial variation in disease risk. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that simultaneously allows for risk estimation and cluster identification. Our model formulation assumes that there is an unknown number of risk classes and small areas are assigned to a risk class by means of independent allocation variables. Therefore, areas within each cluster are assumed to share a common risk but they may be geographically separated. The posterior distribution of the parameter representing the number of risk classes is estimated using a novel procedure that combines its prior distribution with an efficient estimate of the marginal likelihood of the data given this parameter. An extension of the model incorporating covariates is also shown. These covariates may incorporate additional information on the problem or they may account for spatial correlation in the data. We illustrate the performance of the proposed model through both a simulation study and a case study of reported cases of varicella in the city of Valencia, Spain.","['Flórez KC', 'Corberán-Vallet A', 'Iftimi A', 'Bermúdez JD']",2020,15,5,PLoS One,"Flórez KC, et al.

32362894,Vaccination With Live Attenuated Vaccines in Four Children With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia While on Imatinib Treatment.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in childhood and adolescence is a rare malignancy that can successfully be treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. According to the current experience, treatment is necessary for years and, in the majority of cases, a lifelong approach is required to control the malignant disease. To what extent imatinib causes immunosuppression in different age cohorts is a controversial discussion. According to general medical recommendations, live vaccines are contraindicated in individuals treated with imatinib. However, a recent increase in the number of globally reported cases of measles has been observed and continues to rise. Due to the high contagiousness of the virus, near-perfect vaccination coverage (herd immunity of 93 to 95%) is required to effectively protect against measles resurgence-a scenario that is not realistic in many countries. When four teenagers with CML (median age 13 years, range 12-15) who were enrolled into pediatric trial CML-paed II while on imatinib treatment (median treatment duration 36 months, range 11-84) were identified without protective measles and/or varicella titers, we carefully balanced the risks of a live vaccination under immunosuppressive TKI medication against the benefit of being protected.

32341374,Algorithmic discovery of dynamic models from infectious disease data.,"Theoretical models are typically developed through a deductive process where a researcher formulates a system of dynamic equations from hypothesized mechanisms. Recent advances in algorithmic methods can discover dynamic models inductively-directly from data. Most previous research has tested these methods by rediscovering models from synthetic data generated by the already known model. Here we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to discover mechanistic equations for disease dynamics from case notification data for measles, chickenpox, and rubella. The discovered models provide a good qualitative fit to the observed dynamics for all three diseases, However, the SINDy chickenpox model appears to overfit the empirical data, and recovering qualitatively correct rubella dynamics requires using power spectral density in the goodness-of-fit criterion. When SINDy uses a library of second-order functions, the discovered models tend to include mass action incidence and a seasonally varying transmission rate-a common feature of existing epidemiological models for childhood infectious diseases. We also find that the SINDy measles model is capable of out-of-sample prediction of a dynamical regime shift in measles case notification data. These results demonstrate the potential for algorithmic model discovery to enrich scientific understanding by providing a complementary approach to developing theoretical models.","['Horrocks J', 'Bauch CT']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,Horrocks J and Bauch CT.

METHODS: Data for daily climatic variables and varicella incidence from 2006 to 2018 in Guangzhou were collected from the Guangzhou Meteorological Bureau and the National Notifiable Disease Report System. Distributed lag nonlinear models were applied to evaluate the association between climatic factors and varicella incidence.
RESULTS: The nonlinear effects of meteorological factors were observed. At lag day21，when the mean temperature was 31.8 °C, the relative risk was the highest as 1.11 (95% CI: 1.07-1.16). When the diurnal temperature range was 24.0 °C at lag day 20, the highest RR was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.05-1.17). For rainfall, the highest RR was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.01-1.19) at lag day 21，when the aggregate rainfall was 160 mm. When air pressure was 1028 hPa, the highest RR was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04-1.13) at lag day 21. When wind speed was 0.7 m/s, the highest RR was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.04-1.11) at lag day 7. When the hours of sunshine were 9.0 h at lag day 21, the RR was highest as 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02-1.05). Aggregate rainfall, air pressure, and sunshine hours were positively correlated with the incidence of varicella, which was inconsistent with the wind velocity. Mean temperature showed a reverse U-shape curve relationship with varicella, while the diurnal temperature range showed a binomial distribution curve. The extreme effect of climatic factors on the varicella cases was statistically significant, apart from the extremely low effect of rainfall.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results offered fundamental knowledge which might be benefit to give an insight into epidemic trends of varicella and develop an early warning system. We could use our findings about influential factors to strengthen the intervention and prevention of varicella.","['Lu JY', 'Zhang ZB', 'He Q', 'Ma XW', 'Yang ZC']",2020,728,,Sci Total Environ,"Lu JY, et al.

32309885,"Vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in children.","BACKGROUND: Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) are serious diseases that can lead to serious complications, disability, and death. However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. This is an update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, safety, and long- and short-term adverse effects associated with the trivalent vaccine, containing measles, rubella, mumps strains (MMR), or concurrent administration of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or tetravalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella strains (MMRV), given to children aged up to 15 years.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 5), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 2 May 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (2 May 2019), and ClinicalTrials.gov (2 May 2019).
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (PCS/RCS), case-control studies (CCS), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, case cross-over (CCO) studies, case-only ecological method (COEM) studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS) studies, person-time cohort (PTC) studies, and case-coverage design/screening methods (CCD/SM) studies, assessing any combined MMR or MMRV / MMR+V vaccine given in any dose, preparation or time schedule compared with no intervention or placebo, on healthy children up to 15 years of age.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design, vaccine type (MMR, MMRV, MMR+V), virus strain, and study settings. Outcomes of interest were cases of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and harms. Certainty of evidence of was rated using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 138 studies (23,480,668 participants). Fifty-one studies (10,248,159 children) assessed vaccine effectiveness and 87 studies (13,232,509 children) assessed the association between vaccines and a variety of harms. We included 74 new studies to this 2019 version of the review. Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness in preventing measles was 95% after one dose (relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13; 7 cohort studies; 12,039 children; moderate certainty evidence) and 96% after two doses (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28; 5 cohort studies; 21,604 children; moderate certainty evidence). The effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts or preventing transmission to others the children were in contact with after one dose was 81% (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89; 3 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence), after two doses 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75; 3 cohort studies; 378 children; low certainty evidence), and after three doses was 96% (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; 2 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness (at least one dose) in preventing measles after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50; 2 cohort studies; 283 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR vaccine in preventing mumps was 72% after one dose (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76; 6 cohort studies; 9915 children; moderate certainty evidence), 86% after two doses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35; 5 cohort studies; 7792 children; moderate certainty evidence). Effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 3 cohort studies; 1036 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against rubella is 89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 1 cohort study; 1621 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against varicella (any severity) after two doses in children aged 11 to 22 months is 95% in a 10 years follow-up (rate ratio (rr) 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; 1 RCT; 2279 children; high certainty evidence). Safety There is evidence supporting an association between aseptic meningitis and MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains, but no evidence supporting this association for MMR vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn mumps strains (rr 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56; low certainty evidence). The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR/MMR+V/MMRV vaccines (Jeryl Lynn strain) and febrile seizures. Febrile seizures normally occur in 2% to 4% of healthy children at least once before the age of 5. The attributable risk febrile seizures vaccine-induced is estimated to be from 1 per 1700 to 1 per 1150 administered doses. The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk of ITP after vaccination is smaller than after natural infection with these viruses. Natural infection of ITP occur in 5 cases per 100,000 (1 case per 20,000) per year. The attributable risk is estimated about 1 case of ITP per 40,000 administered MMR doses. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and encephalitis or encephalopathy (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61; 2 observational studies; 1,071,088 children; low certainty evidence), and autistic spectrum disorders (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 2 observational studies; 1,194,764 children; moderate certainty). There is insufficient evidence to determine the association between MMR immunisation and inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.16; 3 observational studies; 409 cases and 1416 controls; moderate certainty evidence). Additionally, there is no evidence supporting an association between MMR immunisation and cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR/MMRV vaccines support their use for mass immunisation. Campaigns aimed at global eradication should assess epidemiological and socioeconomic situations of the countries as well as the capacity to achieve high vaccination coverage. More evidence is needed to assess whether the protective effect of MMR/MMRV could wane with time since immunisation.","['Di Pietrantonj C', 'Rivetti A', 'Marchione P', 'Debalini MG', 'Demicheli V']",2020,4,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Di Pietrantonj C, et al.

32305975,Herpes Zoster and Its Prevention by Vaccination.,"Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) results from reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) after primary infection as varicella (chicken pox). It affects mainly older adults and people with immunocompromising diseases or treatments. The most common complication is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which has significant adverse effects on quality of life and activities of daily living. Since PHN cannot be prevented once HZ has occurred, and treatment is only modestly successful and is associated with significant side effects, the recent introduction of an effective vaccine is an important achievement. This new vaccine, which combines a single VZV glycoprotein (gE) and a multicomponent adjuvant, is superior to the previously available live attenuated VZV vaccine. The recombinant adjuvanted vaccine is remarkably effective in restoring the protective T cell-mediated immunity required to prevent HZ. Its clinical efficacy is much greater than that observed with other vaccines for older individuals affected by immune senescence, and its safety profile is very acceptable. It has been recommended in the USA and Canada for people who are 50 years of age and older. The immunogenicity and safety of this vaccine in severely immunocompromised individuals, such as after chemotherapy for malignancy, after solid organ or stem cell transplant, and in people with HIV are being studied.","['Johnson RW', 'Levin MJ']",2020,43,,Interdiscip Top Gerontol Geriatr,Johnson RW and Levin MJ.

32245914,Congenital infections in Hong Kong: an overview of TORCH.,"Congenital infections refer to a group of perinatal infections that may have similar clinical presentations, including rash and ocular findings. TORCH is the acronym that covers these infections (toxoplasmosis, other [syphilis], rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus). There are, however, other important causes of intrauterine/perinatal infections, including enteroviruses, varicella zoster virus, Zika virus, and parvovirus B19. Intrauterine and perinatal infections are significant causes of fetal and neonatal mortality and important contributors to childhood morbidity. A high index of suspicion for congenital infections and awareness of the prominent features of the most common congenital infections can help to facilitate early diagnosis, tailor appropriate diagnostic evaluation, and if appropriate, initiate early treatments. In the absence of maternal laboratory results diagnostic of intrauterine infections, congenital infections should be suspected in newborns with certain clinical features or combinations of clinical features, including hydrops fetalis, microcephaly, seizures, cataract, hearing loss, congenital heart disease, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, or rash. Primary prevention of maternal infections during pregnancy is the cornerstone of prevention of congenital infection. Available resources should focus on the promotion of public health.","['Leung KKY', 'Hon KL', 'Yeung A', 'Leung AKC', 'Man E']",2020,26,2,Hong Kong Med J,"Leung KKY, et al.

32235469,Clinical Presentations and Outcome Studies of Cranial Nerve Involvement in Herpes Zoster Infection: A Retrospective Single-Center Analysis.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection can cause chickenpox and herpes zoster. It sometimes involves cranial nerves, and rarely, it can involve multiple cranial nerves. We aimed to study clinical presentations of cranial nerve involvement in herpes zoster infection. We included patients who had the diagnosis of herpes zoster infection and cranial nerve involvement. The diagnosis was confirmed by typical vesicles and a rash. We excluded patients who had cranial neuralgias or neuropathies but without typical skin lesions (zoster sine herpete or post-herpetic neuralgia). We included 330 patients (mean age, 55.0 ± 17.0 years) who had herpes zoster with cranial nerve involvement, including 155 men and 175 women. Most frequently involved cranial nerves were the trigeminal nerve (57.9%), facial nerve (52.1%), and vestibulocochlear nerve (20.0%). Other involved cranial nerves included the glossopharyngeal nerve (0.9%), vagus nerve (0.9%), oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve, and abducens nerve (each 0.3%, respectively). One hundred and seventy patients (51.5%) had only sensory symptoms/signs; in contrast, 160 patients (48.5%) had both sensory and motor symptoms/signs. Of those 160 patients, sensory preceded motor symptoms/signs in 64 patients (40.0%), sensory and motor symptoms/signs occurred simultaneously in 38 patients (23.8%), and motor preceded sensory symptoms/signs in 20 patients (12.5%).

32233157,A Nationwide Survey on the Hospital Vaccination Policies in Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at risk of being exposed to or transmitting infections in hospitals, and vaccination against vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) is a well-known preventive strategy. Vaccination against influenza, hepatitis B virus, measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, and pertussis is recommended for HCP. However, there is no information on the current status of hospitals' vaccination policies for HCP in Korea.
METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey on hospital vaccination policies and barriers to implementing recommended vaccination programs in 2018. The online survey questionnaire was distributed to 652 hospitals, and 200 of them responded.
RESULTS: Of the 200 surveyed hospitals, 151 (75.5%) conducted a pre-employment screening program for at least one VPD, and 196 (98%) had vaccination programs that included at least one vaccine. Influenza vaccine was most commonly included in their programs (97.5%, n = 195), followed by hepatitis B vaccines (69%, n = 138). However, < 25% of the hospitals included other vaccines in their policies (measles-mumps-rubella, 24.5%; varicella, 18.5%; pertussis, 11%). Only 13 hospitals (6.5%) included the five recommended vaccines for HCP in their policies. Influenza vaccination coverage had a mean of 89.9% and was significantly higher in hospitals fully funding the vaccination cost (91.8% vs. 80.4%, P < 0.001). Among hospitals funding influenza vaccines, the coverage was lower in hospitals with ≥ 700 beds (-6.5%, P = 0.003). Hospitals' financial burden was the most important barrier to implementing vaccination polices as recommended (78.6%, 121/154), followed by lack of awareness (21%) or campaign (21%) and lack of leadership (17%).
CONCLUSION: Despite the recommendations on vaccination for HCP, the vaccination policies for HCP differ in hospitals and appear to be insufficient to protect HCP and prevent nosocomial transmission. Strong leadership of each hospital to protect HCP and financial support from the government are required to implement appropriate vaccination policies in hospitals.","['Park SH', 'Lee MS', 'Kim SR', 'Kwak YG']",2020,35,12,J Korean Med Sci,"Park SH, et al.

Berkeley Madonna 8.3.18 and Microsoft Office Excel 2010 software were employed for the model simulation and data management, respectively. The result showed that the simulated result of SEIR model agreed well with the reported data when β (infected rate) equal to 0.067. Models showed that the cumulative number of cases was only 13 when isolation adopted when the infected individuals were identified (assuming isolation rate was up to 100%); the cumulative number of cases was only two and the TAR (total attack rate) was 0.56% when the vaccination coefficient reached 50%. The cumulative number of cases did not change significantly with the change of efficiency of ventilation and disinfection, but the peak time was delayed; when δ (vaccination coefficient) = 0.1, m (ventilation efficiency) = 0.7 or δ = 0.2, m = 0.5 or δ = 0.3, m = 0.1 or δ = 0.4 and above, the cumulative number of cases would reduce to one case and TAR would reduce to 0.28% with combined interventions.

32170691,Laboratory Methods for Assessing and Licensing Influenza Vaccines for Poultry.,"Avian influenza (AI) vaccines for poultry are based on hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, and protection is specific to the subtype. An estimated 313 billion doses have been used between 2002 and 2018 for high pathogenicity AI control. No universal vaccines are currently available. The majority of AI vaccines are inactivated whole influenza viruses that are grown in embryonating chicken eggs, emulsified in oil adjuvant systems, and injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Live virus-vectored vaccines such as recombinant viruses of fowl pox, Newcastle disease, and herpesvirus of turkeys containing inserts of AI virus HA genes have been used on a more limited basis. Also, vaccines have been licensed or registered based on baculovirus and defective replicating alphavirus (RNA particles) expressing HA protein or DNA vaccine with HA gene insert. In studies to evaluate vaccine efficacy and potency, the protocol design and its implementation should address the biosafety level needed for the work, provide information required for approval by Institutional Biosafety and Animal Care Committees, contain information on seed strain selection, provide needed information on animal subjects and their relevant parameters, and address the selection and use of challenge viruses. Various metrics have been used to directly measure vaccine-induced protection, including prevention of death, clinical signs, and lesions; prevention of decreases in egg production and alterations in egg quality; quantification of the reduction in virus replication and shedding from the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tracts; and prevention of contact transmission in in vivo poultry experiments. In addition, indirect measures of vaccine potency and protection have been developed and validated against the direct measures and include serological assays in vaccinated poultry and the assessment of the content of HA antigen in the vaccine. These indirect assessments of protection are useful in determining if vaccine batches have a consistent ability to protect. For adequate potency, vaccines should contain 50 mean protective doses of antigen per dose, which corresponds to 0.3-7.8 μg of HA protein in inactivated vaccines, depending on immunogenicity and antigenic relatedness of individual seed strains.",['Swayne DE'],2020,2123,,Methods Mol Biol,Swayne DE.

32125664,Varicella-Zoster Virus infected human neurons are resistant to apoptosis.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a pathogenic human herpesvirus that causes varicella (chickenpox) as a primary infection following which it becomes latent in ganglionic neurons. Following viral reactivation many years later VZV causes herpes zoster (shingles) as well as a variety of other neurological syndromes. The molecular mechanisms of the conversion of the virus from a lytic to a latent state in ganglia are not well understood. In order to gain insights into the neuron-virus interaction, we studied virus-induced apoptosis in cultures of both highly pure terminally differentiated human neurons and human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL). It was found that (a) VZV DNA did not accumulate in infected human neurons; (b) VZV transcripts were present at lower levels at all days studied post-infection in neurons; (c) Western blot analysis showed less VZV IE 63 and very little detectable VZV gE proteins in infected neurons compared with HFL; (d) lower levels of the apoptotic marker cleaved Caspase-3 protein were detected in VZV-infected neurons compared with HFL, and higher levels of the known anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2, Bcl-XL and also the mitochondrial MT-CO2 protein were found in VZV-infected neurons compared with uninfected cells; and (e) both the MT-CO2 protein and VZV IE 63-encoded protein were detected in infected neurons by dual immunofluorescence. These findings showed that neurons are resistant to VZV-induced apoptosis, which may have relevance to the switching of VZV from a lytic to latent ganglionic neuronal infection.","['Kennedy PG', 'Graner MW', 'Gunaydin D', 'Bowlin J', 'Pointon T', 'Yu X']",2020,26,3,J Neurovirol,"Kennedy PG, et al.

METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 8 eyes (7 children) with stromal keratitis after varicella seen in our referral cornea center. All patients received a systemic antiviral treatment with oral acyclovir and topical steroid eye drops. Topical cyclosporine eye drops were associated with steroids in case of steroid dependence or steroid-related side effects. Both antiinflammatory treatments were slowly tapered over time.
RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 3 years and 4 months. Stromal keratitis was unilateral in 6 children (85.7%) and consisted of superficial nummular keratitis in 4 cases and deep stromal diffuse keratitis in 3 cases. During the median follow-up of 31 months (range, 13-59 months), 6 children had 1 to 6 episodes of relapse. The median duration of topical steroid eye drop was 26 months (range, 2-59 months). Topical cyclosporine eye drops were used with steroids in 3 patients (42.9%). Three patients stopped topical steroids after 2, 5, and 8 months, without recurrence. Four patients were still undergoing treatment after a median of 43 months (range, 26-59 months). All patients regained a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 at the end of the follow-up.

32118512,Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with breakthrough varicella during varicella outbreaks.,"BACKGROUND: Although a varicella vaccine has been available in China since 1998 in the private sector, varicella outbreaks and breakthrough varicella (BV) still occur. In 2018, four varicella outbreaks with high BV rate sequentially occurred in four schools in Lu'an, sparking local public health authority's concerns on the varicella vaccine. Therefore, we conducted this investigation to evaluate varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE), characterize BV, and detect potential risk factors associated with BV.
METHODS: This was a three-stage study. First, a retrospective cohort study was done in each school to estimate the VEs of varicella vaccine  during outbreaks. Second, a descriptive epidemiological method was used to describe the characteristics of the four outbreaks and to compare the clinical characteristics between the BV cases and unvaccinated varicella cases. To identify the risk factors associated with BV, we conducted an unmatched case-control study in the third stage of the study.
RESULTS: A total of 199 cases were identified among four outbreaks, and the overall attack rate was 14%. Of 1203 students with available vaccination information, 822 (68%) were vaccinated at least once. The overall VEs among four outbreaks ranged from 19% to 69%, whereas the VE against moderate or severe varicella ranged from 74% to 90%. Compared with unvaccinated varicella cases, the moderate or severe varicella (
CONCLUSIONS: The overall VE was insufficient to protect varicella infection, and the VE for moderate or severe varicella was only moderate. The manifestations of BV cases were generally milder than those seen in natural varicella infection.

Seropositivity increased gradually with age, with 60% and 80% at ages 10 years and 30 years, respectively, and ranging between 80% and 90% thereafter. Higher odds for VZV seronegativity were seen among persons who were born in CN or had resided there since early childhood, and among single-person households.
CONCLUSIONS: VZV susceptibility is relatively high among adolescents and adults in CN. In order to reduce the burden of VZV-related disease in these populations, routine varicella vaccination is recommended. As data are scarce, the study findings can serve as a blueprint for the epidemiology in tropical regions.","['Vos RA', 'Mollema L', 'van Boven M', 'van Lier A', 'Smits G', 'Janga-Jansen AVA', 'Baboe-Kalpoe S', 'Hulshof K', 'Stienstra Y', 'van der Klis FRM', 'de Melker HE']",2020,94,,Int J Infect Dis,"Vos RA, et al.

32068320,Varicella infection following vaccination in a pediatric kidney transplant recipient.,"Live viral vaccines have historically been avoided in children after solid organ transplantation. Multiple reports of safety and immunogenicity, largely in the pediatric liver transplant population, have led to a reconsideration of this recommendation. Here, we report the case of a 4-year-old boy who inadvertently received the live attenuated MMR-varicella vaccine (MMRV) at a routine well-child visit 16 months after receiving a living donor kidney transplant. This was not known until after he was admitted with rash and documented disseminated varicella infection 5 weeks later. He was treated with intravenous acyclovir followed by oral therapy and recovered fully. This case and its discussion illustrate what is still unknown about the risk-to-benefit ratio of live viral vaccination in any individual transplant recipient. Criteria to determine which patients should receive these vaccines should be evaluated before their use after transplant becomes routine, and all recipients and their families should be counseled to have a low threshold to seek medical care for any febrile illness or rash after live viral vaccination.","['Bobrowski AE', 'Muller WJ']",2020,24,4,Pediatr Transplant,Bobrowski AE and Muller WJ.

We investigated the characteristics of varicella cases derived from within-household transmission and the modes of varicella transmission between school and household settings in Shanghai, China, from 2009 to 2018. Within-household transmission occurred in 278 households, of which 134 transmission events were between children. Sixty-one household varicella transmission events may be attributed to isolation procedures for infected students during school outbreaks, and 7.6% of school outbreaks were caused by schoolchildren cases derived from within-household transmission. The frequency of 'school-household-school' transmission adds an additional layer of complexity to the control of school varicella outbreaks. Administration of varicella vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis after exposure is considered to be an effective measure to control varicella spread within households and schools.","['Chen YF', 'Zhou Q', 'Liu JY', 'Gong RJ', 'Mao SQ', 'Ye ZJ', 'Wu QS']",2020,148,,Epidemiol Infect,"Chen YF, et al.

32046891,Assessment of pre-specified adverse events following varicella vaccine: A population-based self-controlled risk interval study.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials and spontaneous reporting systems have revealed rare but biologically plausible adverse events following varicella immunization. Few post-marketing controlled studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between the varicella vaccine and these outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of pneumonia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), meningitis, encephalitis and ischemic stroke following varicella immunization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This nationwide observational study was based on Taiwan National Health Insurance data and National Immunization Information System from 2004 through 2014. Primary analysis included children aged 12-35 months who received the single varicella vaccine on the date of administration. The self-controlled risk interval design compared the incidence of pre-specified outcomes during a risk interval of 1-42 days post-vaccination and a control interval of 43-84 days. The outcomes of interest were defined as admitted pneumonia, ITP, meningitis, encephalitis, and ischemic stroke, as well as fracture as a negative control. Conditional Poisson regression was used to assess the incidence rate ratio (aIRR) with adjustments for age and seasonal effects.
RESULTS: Among 1,194,189 children, who receiving the varicella vaccine, there was no observed increase in the risk for ITP (aIRR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76-1.33), meningitis (aIRR 1.21; 95% CI, 0.49-2.95), encephalitis (aIRR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.62-1.60), or ischemic stroke (aIRR 1.24; 95% CI, 0.31-4.95). A clustering feature with pneumonia occurred during days 36-42 post-vaccination (aIRR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18). An increase in the risk for ITP was observed in children receiving the varicella and MMR vaccines concomitantly (aIRR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.19-2.43), but not among those receiving the varicella vaccine only.
CONCLUSIONS: We detected a small risk of incidental pneumonia associated with varicella vaccine in the 6th week after immunization. There was no increase in the risk of other pre-specified adverse events.","['Liu CH', 'Yeh YC', 'Huang WT', 'Chie WC', 'Chan KA']",2020,38,11,Vaccine,"Liu CH, et al.

32040658,First report on molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of Reticuloendotheliosis virus in Sudan.,"The reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) group of retroviruses infects a wide range of avian species, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, quail, and prairie chickens. The infection can result in immunosuppression, runting syndrome, high mortality, acute reticular cell neoplasia, or T- and/or B-cell lymphoma. One PCR positive chicken spleen sample obtained in a previous study in addition to one Marek's disease and three fowl pox (FP) vaccine samples were investigated in this study. A PCR assay was performed to detect the presence of REV provirus DNA in these samples. The results indicated the contamination of fowl pox virus and Marek's disease vaccines with REV. In addition, detection of integration of REV inside the genome of fowl pox vaccine was confirmed using primers corresponding to the FPV DNA regions flanking the REV integration site. Alignments of two sequences, one from the spleen tissue and the other from contaminated FP vaccine with REV, with other REV (env) gene sequences obtained from GenBank indicated their high similarity. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the partial part of (env) gene of our two isolates was closely related to variants from India, USA, Taiwan, and China. These results confirmed the contamination of commercial fowl pox and Marek's disease vaccines used in Sudan with REV.

In 2011, Italian Drug Authority (AIFA) recommended the discontinuation of the MMRV use for an increased risk of febrile seizures following vaccination; furthermore, some Regions (such as Apulia, that introduced MMRV offer in 2009) chose to continue the use of MMRV and Ministry of Health recommended to guarantee supplemental monitoring of safety of the vaccine. In Italy, the surveillance of Adverse Events following immunization (AEFIs) is currently carried out by AIFA and Regional Health Authorities; this paper aims to summarize the results of MMRV-vaccine surveillance of AEFIs program carried out in Apulia. From the AIFA database, we selected MMRV AEFIs that occurred in Apulia (about 4,000,000 inhabitants) from 2009 to 2017. For serious AEFIs, we applied the WHO causality assessment algorithm, using for cases hospitalized information from individual medical records. In the 8 years of observation, 155 MMRV-AEFIs (reporting rate: 37.9×100,000 doses) occurred of which 26 were classified as serious (6.3×100,000 doses) and 22 led to hospitalization. Performing causality assessment, for 10 the classification was ""consistent causal association to immunization"" (reporting rate: 2.4×100000 doses), for 2 indeterminate, for 13 ""inconsistent causal association to immunization"" and for 1 not-classifiable. No case of febrile seizure resulted consistent to vaccination.

32038653,Manipulation of the Innate Immune Response by Varicella Zoster Virus.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster). VZV and other members of the herpesvirus family are distinguished by their ability to establish a latent infection, with the potential to reactivate and spread virus to other susceptible individuals. This lifelong relationship continually subjects VZV to the host immune system and as such VZV has evolved a plethora of strategies to evade and manipulate the immune response. This review will focus on our current understanding of the innate anti-viral control mechanisms faced by VZV. We will also discuss the diverse array of strategies employed by VZV to regulate these innate immune responses and highlight new knowledge on the interactions between VZV and human innate immune cells.","['Gerada C', 'Campbell TM', 'Kennedy JJ', 'McSharry BP', 'Steain M', 'Slobedman B', 'Abendroth A']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"Gerada C, et al.

32036802,New approaches to controlling an outbreak of chickenpox in a large immigration detention setting in England: the role of serological testing and mathematical modelling.,"Chickenpox is caused by varicella-zoster-virus (VZV) and is highly contagious. Immigration detention settings are a high-risk environment for primary VZV transmission, with large, rapidly-changing populations in close quarters, and higher susceptibility among non-UK-born individuals. During outbreaks, operational challenges occur in detention settings because of high-turnover and the potential need to implement population movement restriction for prolonged periods. Between December 2017 and February 2018, four cases of chickenpox were notified amongst 799 detainees in an immigration removal centre (IRC). Microbiological investigations included case confirmation by vesicular fluid polymerase chain reaction, and VZV serology for susceptibility testing. Control measures involved movement restrictions, isolation of cases, quarantining and cohorting of non-immune contacts and extending VZV immunity testing to the wider detainee population to support outbreak management. Immunity was tested for 301/532 (57%) detainees, of whom 24 (8%) were non-immune. The level of non-immunity was lower than expected based on the existing literature on VZV seroprevalence in detained populations in England. Serology results identified non-immune contacts who could be cohorted and, due to the lack of isolation capacity, allowed the placement of cases with immune detainees. The widespread immunity testing of all detainees was proving challenging to sustain because it required significant resources and was having a severe impact on operational capacity and the ability to maintain core business activities at the IRC. Therefore, mathematical modelling was used to assess the impact of scaling back mass immunity testing. Modelling demonstrated that interrupting testing posed a risk of one additional case compared to continuing with testing. As such, the decision was made to stop testing, and the outbreak was successfully controlled without excessive strain on resources. Operational challenges generated learning for future outbreaks, with implications for a local and national policy on IRC staff occupational health requirements, and proposed reception screening of detainees for VZV immunity.","['Zhang XS', 'Smith A', 'Patel B', 'Anderson C', 'Pomeroy L', 'Higgins G', ""O'Moore É"", 'Chow Y', 'Atchison C']",2020,148,,Epidemiol Infect,"Zhang XS, et al.

When documentation of complete vaccination or laboratory-confirmed infection is not available, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) criteria are used to guide vaccination or anti-MMRV IgG testing. We assessed the performance of the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG multiplex flow immunoassay (MFI; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and matched immunofluorescence assays (IFAs; MBL Bion, Des Plaines, IL) in 220 HCWs categorized by ACIP criteria for presumptive immunity to MMRV. Among HCWs presumptively immune to measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV, the Bio-Rad MFI was positive in 77.3, 85.4, 84.3, and 91.1% of HCWs, respectively. Comparatively, the Bion IFA was positive in 92.9, 91.1, and 93.5% of HCWs presumptively immune to measles, mumps, and VZV (a rubella IFA was unavailable). Among HCWs fully vaccinated against measles, mumps, and VZV, Bio-Rad MFI/Bion IFA positivity rates were 77.4%/93%, 84.8%/90.7%, and 54.5%/90.9%, respectively. The Bio-Rad MFI was positive in 83.7% of HCWs fully vaccinated against rubella. For HCWs whose last vaccination event occurred within 15 years of enrollment, 83.3, 93.3, and 74.2% were positive by the Bio-Rad measles, mumps, and rubella IgG MFIs, respectively. We show significantly decreased Bio-Rad MFI sensitivity for detection of anti-measles and anti-mumps IgG-class antibodies in presumptively immune or fully vaccinated HCWs. Although negative results typically prompt revaccination, failure to recognize presumptive immunity in individuals unable to receive live, attenuated vaccines may have employment implications.","['Theel ES', 'Sorenson M', 'Rahman C', 'Granger D', 'Vaughn A', 'Breeher L']",2020,58,4,J Clin Microbiol,"Theel ES, et al.

However, the risk of PD in patients with each specific infection varied. This meta-analysis estimated the association between various infections and PD risk.
METHODS: Literature published from January 1965 to October 2019 in PubMed and EMBASE databases was searched. Data were extracted and pooled using random/fixed effects model. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were also performed to analyze the source of heterogeneity. Publication bias was estimated by the trim and fill.
RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 6,609 studies were included. Helicobacter pylori (HP; pooled OR = 1.653, 1.426-1.915, p < .001), hepatitis C virus (HCV; pooled OR = 1.195, 1.012-1.410, p = .035), Malassezia (pooled OR = 1.694, 1.367-2.100, p < .001), and pneumoniae (pooled OR = 1.595, 1.020-2.493, p = .041) infection were associated with increased PD risk. Influenza virus, herpes virus, hepatitis B virus, scarlet fever, mumps virus, chicken pox, pertussis, German measles, and measles were not associated with PD risk. After antiviral treatment against HCV reduced the risk of PD in patients with HCV infection (OR = 0.672, 0.571-0.791, p < .001). Significant heterogeneity exists among the included studies.
CONCLUSION: Patients with infection of HP, HCV, Malassezia, pneumoniae might be an increased risk of PD.

RESULTS: Data from 13 pediatric rheumatology centers in 10 countries, including 234 patients, were collected. Mean age at diagnosis was 5 ± 2.7 years, 67% were girls. Among them, 211 (90.2%) had JIA and 110 (47%) were in remission on medication. Disease activity was low in 37%, high in 8%, and moderate in 8%. One hundred-twenty-four received MMR/V booster while on methotrexate (MTX); 3 reported local mild adverse events (AE). Among 62 on MTX + biologics and 9 patients who received a combination of 2 disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), 9 reported mild AE.

31986424,Is antibody titer useful to verify the immunization after VZV Vaccine in MS patients treated with Fingolimod? A case series.,"BACKGROUND: Fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya) is a second line therapy to treat relapsing MS not responding to first-line treatments and/or with a high disease activity (according to Italian Regulatory authorities). Before starting Fingolimod, patients' immunity to varicella zoster virus (VZV) needs to be assessed and seronegative patients vaccinated. To test susceptibility and response, IgG antibodies are tested after immunization. Since Fingolimod determines a reduction of circulating B lymphocytes and immunoglobulins, we aimed at describing the trend of VZV antibodies in seronegative vaccinated patients with MS before and after treatment.
METHODS: A total of 23 patients vaccinated for VZV before starting Fingolimod treatment, were recruited in this observational retrospective study involving five MS Centers in Campania (Italy). Of these, 12 patients were excluded for missing data. Patients received two doses of Varivax® Vaccine. After vaccination patients were re-tested and were all positive for IgG-VZV. We re-tested IgG-VZV in the same laboratory after a mean time of 2.42 years from Fingolimod therapy start.
RESULTS: During Fingolimod therapy we observed a global reduction of antibody titer and a disappearance in 7/11 patients. Titer disappearance was more probable in patients with lower post-vaccination titer. Of the 7 patients with vanishing IgG-VZV, three suspended Fingolimod for adverse event. In two of them, we observed a reappearance of antibody titer after treatment cessation. In one patient chickenpox infection occurred one year later.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our observational study shows that Fingolimod could influence antibody titer probably through its effect on B lymphocytes, but the efficacy of the vaccination should be verified. In conclusion, it is necessary to pay attention to therapies acting on B lymphocytes as they could influence the antibody titer and efficacy of vaccination making the search for other markers of vaccine efficacy desirable such as cell-mediated immunity with proliferation and induction of memory T lymphocytes in response to viral glycoproteins.","['Signoriello E', 'Bonavita S', 'Sinisi L', 'Russo CV', 'Maniscalco GT', 'Casertano S', 'Saccà F', 'Lanzillo R', 'Morra VB', 'Lus G']",2020,40,,Mult Scler Relat Disord,"Signoriello E, et al.

31969318,Risk of herpes zoster after exposure to varicella to explore the exogenous boosting hypothesis: self controlled case series study using UK electronic healthcare data.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude and duration of any hypothesised protective effect of household exposure to a child with varicella on the relative incidence of herpes zoster in adults.
DESIGN: Self controlled case series.
SETTING: UK general practices contributing to Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
PARTICIPANTS: 9604 adults (≥18 years) with a diagnosis of herpes zoster (in primary care or hospital records) between 1997 and 2018, who during their observation period lived with a child (<18 years) with a diagnosis of varicella.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative incidence of herpes zoster in the 20 years after exposure to a child with varicella in the household compared with baseline time (all other time, excluding the 60 days before exposure).
RESULTS: 6584 of the 9604 adults with herpes zoster (68.6%) were women. Median age of exposure to a child with varicella was 38.3 years (interquartile range 32.3-48.8 years) and median observation period was 14.7 (11.1-17.7) years. 4116 adults developed zoster in the baseline period, 433 in the 60 days before exposure and 5055 in the risk period. After adjustment for age, calendar time, and season, strong evidence suggested that in the two years after household exposure to a child with varicella, adults were 33% less likely to develop zoster (incidence ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.73) compared with baseline time. In the 10-20 years after exposure, adults were 27% less likely to develop herpes zoster (0.73, 0.62 to 0.87) compared with baseline time. A stronger boosting effect was observed among men than among women after exposure to varicella.
CONCLUSIONS: The relative incidence of zoster was lower in the periods after exposure to a household contact with varicella, with modest but long lasting protective effects observed. This study suggests that exogenous boosting provides some protection from the risk of herpes zoster, but not complete immunity, as assumed by previous cost effectiveness estimates of varicella immunisation.","['Forbes H', 'Douglas I', 'Finn A', 'Breuer J', 'Bhaskaran K', 'Smeeth L', 'Packer S', 'Langan SM', 'Mansfield KE', 'Marlow R', 'Whitaker H', 'Warren-Gash C']",2020,368,,BMJ,"Forbes H, et al.

Varicella vaccination has not been introduced into routine immunization programs in China, and varicella outbreaks have continued to occur. Taking the city of Chongqing, which has a high prevalence of varicella, as an example, this study explored the spatiotemporal epidemiology of varicella. Based on the reported data of varicella cases from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 in Chongqing, hot spots and space-time clusters of varicella were identified using spatial autocorrelation analysis and scan statistics. Within this period, a total of 112,273 varicella cases were reported in Chongqing (average annual incidence: 73.44 per 100,000), including one death. The incidence of varicella showed an increasing trend with significant seasonal peaks, which occurred during April to July and October to January of the following year. The total ratio of male to female patients affected was 1.10:1. Children under the age of 15 and students accounted for the majority of the patient population. The hotspots detected through local spatial autocorrelation analysis, and the most likely clusters identified by scan analysis, were primarily in the main urban districts of Chongqing. The secondary clusters were mostly detected in northeast and southwest Chongqing. There were obvious spatial dependence and spatiotemporal clustering characteristics of varicella in Chongqing from 2014 to 2018. High-risk districts, populations, and peak periods were found in this study, which could be helpful in implementing varicella prevention and control programs, and in adjusting vaccination strategies for the varicella vaccine based on actual conditions.","['Zhu H', 'Zhao H', 'Ou R', 'Zeng Q', 'Hu L', 'Qiu H', 'Sharma M', 'Ye M']",2020,17,2,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Zhu H, et al.

31967286,Seroprevalence of varicella antibodies in adults without clinical history of disease.,"Varicella in adults and immunocompromised patients can be severe. The clinical diagnosis of varicella has high accuracy and the history of disease has a high positive predictive value for protection. A significant portion of adults, however, cannot remember if they have had varicella, especially older individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the seroprevalence of varicella protective antibodies titers in adults with no clinical history of disease, attended at a Reference Center for Special Immunobiologicals and Travel Medicine in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Titration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to varicella-zoster was determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Among 140 adults without history of varicella, 92% had protective antibody titers. We concluded that seroprevalence of varicella-zoster protection was very high in adults with negative history of disease and the use of serology before vaccination reduced significantly unnecessary vaccine and immunoglobulin use.","['Büchele KS', 'Correa DF', 'Tuyama M', 'Lemos ADS', 'Costa MDD', 'Mesquita EC', 'Costa DMD', 'Cerbino-Neto J', 'Varela MC', 'Brasil PEAAD', 'Brandão LGP']",2020,36,1,Cad Saude Publica,"Büchele KS, et al.

This study aimed to investigate the incidence and characteristics of VZV infection in pediatric auto-HCT recipients and explore the risk factors of VZV infection and its effect on survival outcomes. This study included all pediatric patients who underwent auto-HCT at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, between January 1998 and December 2013. Before 2006, short-term acyclovir prophylaxis was provided until neutrophil engraftment; thereafter, routine prophylaxis was not provided. Patients who developed either herpes zoster or chickenpox within 2 years from transplantation were identified, and a chart review was performed. A total of 413 recipients and 698 auto-HCTs were included. Sixty-one episodes of VZV infections were identified in 54 patients. Fourteen cases of VZV infection (23%; 14 of 61) occurred within 30 days after auto-HCT. The cumulative incidence of the first episode of VZV infection at 2 years after transplantation was 14% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9% to 22.8%) in all recipients and 9% (95% CI, 1.0 to 26.6) in VZV-seronegative patients. Notably, the VZV infection rate increased with age and the VZV infection rate in patients age 15 to 19 years was almost three times higher than in patients age 0 to 4 years (28% versus 10%; P = .003). However, there was no difference in the VZV infection rate between recipients of single auto-HCT and recipients of tandem auto-HCT. Two patients died of disseminated VZV infection. VZV infection is a considerable risk in auto-HCT recipients with or without short-term prophylaxis. Universal antiviral prophylaxis might be considered, particularly in older children, regardless of VZV serologic results. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of VZV infection in pediatric auto-HCT recipients reported to date.","['Kang JM', 'Kim JM', 'Lee JW', 'Yoo KH', 'Sung KW', 'Koo HH', 'Kim YJ']",2020,26,5,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,"Kang JM, et al.

31959424,Women who received varicella vaccine versus natural infection have different long-term T cell immunity but similar antibody levels.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection during pregnancy is associated with serious fetal anomalies. The live-attenuated VZV vaccine was approved in 1995, so many vaccinated women are now of childbearing age. The question of long-term immunity to varicella is critical because breakthrough chickenpox can occur after vaccination.
OBJECTIVE: To compare humoral and T cell immunity between women of childbearing age who were immunized by vaccination or chickenpox disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Non-pregnant females between 18 and 36 years old with a history of VZV immunization (n = 20) or prior chickenpox disease (n = 20) were recruited. IgG antibody titers and T cell responses were measured by flow cytometry-based methods in serum and peripheral blood, respectively.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in median antibody titers between vaccinated and chickenpox groups (p = 0.34). The chickenpox group had significantly higher levels of VZV antigen-specific CD4 T cells (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Natural infection induced higher VZV-specific T cell immune responses than vaccination.","['Tourtelot E', 'Quataert S', 'Glantz JC', 'Perlis L', 'Muthukrishnan G', 'Mosmann T']",2020,38,7,Vaccine,"Tourtelot E, et al.

31959321,Hepatitis B Birth Dose Effects on Childhood Immunization in the U.S.,"INTRODUCTION: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends administering the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth, making it the first vaccine that many children receive. However, few studies examine whether children who miss the birth dose are at increased risk of vaccination delay. This study investigates birth dose as a determinant of up-to-date immunization status at age 18 months, considering 7 core childhood vaccine series: diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis; polio; measles, mumps, and rubella; Haemophilus influenzae type B; varicella; hepatitis B; and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected in 2017 by National Immunization Survey-Child, a nationally representative survey of children aged 19-35 months living in the U.S., and were analyzed in 2019. The primary outcome was combined 7-vaccine series (4:3:1:3:3:1:4) up-to-date status at 18 months. Doubly robust estimates of association were calculated using survey logistic regression and propensity scores estimated with boosted classification and regression trees.
RESULTS: Children who received the birth dose had 2.01 (95% CI=1.74, 2.33) times the odds of being up-to-date on the combined 7-vaccine series as children who did not. ORs for all the 7 individual vaccine series were positive, ranging from 1.59 (95% CI=1.28, 1.97) for measles, mumps, and rubella to 4.97 (95% CI=3.97, 6.24) for hepatitis B.
CONCLUSIONS: Receiving the birth dose is positively associated with up-to-date status later in childhood, highlighting the importance of starting vaccination early. The association is insensitive to confounding by factors observed in National Immunization Survey-Child, but investigation of unobserved factors such as vaccine hesitancy could provide critical information to guide intervention strategy.","['Vader DT', 'Lee BK', 'Evans AA']",2020,58,2,Am J Prev Med,"Vader DT, et al.

31952510,Fatal hemorrhagic varicella in a patient with abdominal pain: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is normally a self-limited childhood disease caused by varicella-zoster virus infection. However, it sometimes causes severe diseases, especially in immunocompromised individuals. We report a case of severe varicella in a young woman.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and a rash after taking methylprednisolone for 2 weeks for systemic lupus erythematosis. The laboratory data showed leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, an elevated level of the liver transaminases and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple air-fluid levels in the intestines. Hemorrhagic varicella was considered and antiviral therapy as well as immunoglobin were applied. Her condition deteriorated and she eventually died due to multi-organ failure and refractory shock. Next-generation sequencing performed on fluid from an unroofed vesicle confirmed the diagnosis of varicella.
CONCLUSION: In its severe form, VZV infection can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients. Hemorrhagic varicella can be misdiagnosed by clinicians because of unfamiliar with the disease, although it is associated with a high mortality rate. In patients with suspected hemorrhagic varicella infection, antiviral therapies along with supportive treatment need to be initiated as soon as possible in order to minimize the case fatality rate.","['Zhang W', 'Ruan QL', 'Yan F', 'Hu YK']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Zhang W, et al.

31890472,Varicella-zoster virus post-exposure management and prophylaxis: A review.,"Varicella-zoster virus causes both varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Although varicella incidence has dramatically declined since introduction of the live-attenuated varicella vaccine, vaccination rates are suboptimal, and outbreaks still occur. Additionally, herpes zoster incidence continues to rise. Severe or fatal complications may result from varicella transmission to at-risk individuals who are exposed to either varicella or herpes zoster. An increasing number of children and adults are receiving immunosuppressive therapies and are at high risk for severe varicella and other complications if exposed to the virus. Clinical management of individuals exposed to varicella-zoster virus should take into consideration the type of exposure, evidence of immunity, and host-immune status with regard to ability to receive varicella vaccination safely. Post-exposure varicella vaccination may prevent infection or mitigate disease severity in persons eligible for vaccination. Post-exposure prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin is indicated for populations ineligible for vaccination, including immunocompromised children and adults, pregnant women, newborns of mothers with varicella shortly before or after delivery, and premature infants. Appropriate post-exposure management of individuals exposed to either varicella or herpes zoster-including assessment of immune status and rapid provision of optimal prophylaxis-can help avoid potentially devastating complications of varicella-zoster virus infection.","['Lachiewicz AM', 'Srinivas ML']",2019,16,,Prev Med Rep,Lachiewicz AM and Srinivas ML.

We evaluated vaccination rate and immunity of children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).
METHODS: Immunization rate of 329 children with IBD (n = 300) and AIH (n = 29) was assessed in seven German centres using vaccination certificates, history of chicken pox and by determining anti-varicella zoster virus (VZV) and anti-measles IgG antibodies.
RESULTS: Of the total cohort 86% received long-term immunosuppression. Four doses of a hexavalent vaccine were documented in 89%, at least one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination was documented in 325 (99%), with 300 (92%) receiving two doses. Anti-measles IgG concentrations were insufficient in 11% of the immunized patients. VZV vaccination was officially recommended in Germany since 2004, and implemented in 88% born from 2005 onwards. In patients born earlier VZV catch up vaccination only reached 25% (n = 67). Of 118 patients with documented VZV vaccination 25 (21%) did not display sufficient anti-VZV IgG. Of 198 patients with a history of chicken pox, six had undetectable anti-VZV IgG. Of 29 patients having neither had chicken pox nor VZV vaccination, 20 were found to have sufficient anti-VZV IgG.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort vaccination coverage for hexavalent and MMR vaccinations was good, but insufficient for VZV vaccination in patients born before 2005. Neither the vaccination certificate nor the history of chicken pox is reliable to predict VZV immunity indicating a need for serologic investigations and if needed vaccination before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.","['Cagol L', 'Seitel T', 'Ehrenberg S', 'Frivolt K', 'Krahl A', 'Lainka E', 'Gerner P', 'Lenhartz H', 'Vermehren J', 'Radke M', 'Trenkel S', 'Mayer B', 'Koletzko S', 'Debatin KM', 'Mertens T', 'Posovszky C']",2020,38,7,Vaccine,"Cagol L, et al.

METHODS: Mortality rates and hospitalizations rates associated with varicella were evaluated between 2010 and 2016 and described according to Brazilian macro regions and age. The population was stratified into age groups: < 1year, 1-4 years, and 5-14 years. Data were collected from the Informatics Department of the Unified Health System. A percentage difference was calculated between rates of hospitalizations and mortality in the pre (2010-2012) and post-vaccination periods (2014-2016) to estimate the approximate effectiveness of the vaccine.
DATA SYNTHESIS: At the national level, vaccination significantly reduced the mortality rates and hospitalizations rates in all age groups analyzed. Among those under 5 years of age, mortality rates and hospitalizations rates decreased 57-49% and 40-47%, respectively. There was a national decrease of up to 57% in the mortality rates due to the disease, with smaller decreases seen in the North and Northeast regions and the largest in the South and Southeast regions. The hospitalizations rates for varicella reached a maximum national decline of 47%. In children aged 1-4 years, with higher vaccination coverage, the highest reduction was observed in both mortality rates and hospitalizations rates, which decreased from 2.6 to 0.4/100,000/year.
CONCLUSIONS: The tetra vaccine proved to be effective in reducing both mortality and hospitalizations of children and adolescents up to 15 years of age in the 2014-2016 triennium.","['Ribeiro MZ', 'Kupek E', 'Ribeiro PVZ', 'Pinheiro CEA']",2020,96,6,J Pediatr (Rio J),"Ribeiro MZ, et al.

31813430,"Why are people dying due to tuberculosis? A study from Alappuzha District, Kerala, India.","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB)is a major killer disease worldwide. It is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause from a single infectious agent. In India also, TB kills about 480,000 persons every year and more than 1400 every day. Vision of the National TB Control Programme is TB-Free India with zero deaths, disease and poverty due to TB. Specific targets set in the End TB strategy include a 90% reduction in TB deaths and an 80% reduction in TB incidence by 2030, compared with 2015. Understanding about real cause of death is important to plan strategies to further prevent TB deaths. In the above circumstances we conducted a study, the objective of which was to find out the cause of deaths among patients registered in RNTCP unit of Alappuzha district of Kerala, India.
METHODS: In RNTCP a patient who died during the course of treatment regardless of cause is declared as 'Died' due to TB. During the year 2015, 1618 cases were registered in RNTCP of Alappuzha district of which 90 patients died, showing a case fatality rate of 5.56%. Verbal autopsy can be considered as an essential public health tool for studying reasonable estimate of the cause of death at a community level even though not an accurate method at individual level. As part of the study, we visited the 4 RNTCP units of the district and collected the address of the TB patients who died in the area. With the help of the field staff we visited their houses and filled the death audit form of RNTCP along with the additional details. Verbal autopsy was conducted using WHO verbal autopsy format 2012 with immediate house hold contacts.
RESULTS: Out of 90 deaths which occurred, three addresses could not be traced and another 15 patient relatives could not be contacted as they migrated out or were not available at their homes on two visits. Among them, mean age was found to be 62.6 years (SD+12.9). Males were 67 (77%) and rest 20 (23%)were females. Cause of death was analysed after Verbal autopsy for 72 deaths. Among 72 deaths, it was found that 29 (40.3%) had nothing other than TB, where as cause of death for 13 (18.1%) patients was myocardial infarction, 11 (15.3%) had cancer, 2 (2.8%) stroke and 17 (23.7%) other causes which include bronchiectasis, COPD, chicken pox, hepatitis, renal failure, and suicide. Only in 35 cases nothing other than TB could be suggested as a cause of death. Thus in 52 out of 87 (60%) cases, the causes of death were diseases other than TB.
CONCLUSION: Among the TB deaths in Alappuzha district, 60% of deaths were due to diseases other than TB. Along with early diagnosis of all TB cases, screening for co-morbidity, appropriate management of co-morbidity and periodic clinical review of TB patients should also be part of the major strategies to prevent TB related deaths.","['Karthika M', 'Philip S', 'Prathibha MT', 'Varghese A', 'Rakesh PS']",2019,66,4,Indian J Tuberc,"Karthika M, et al.

Co-administration can be performed when there are specific indications in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of the vaccines; but, in absence of these indications, the practice is possible if there are no specific contraindications nor scientific evidence to discourage simultaneous administration. The aim of this work is to review the safety and efficacy of co-administration of the tetravalent measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) and the meningococcal C (Men C) conjugate vaccines after 12 months of age. Several studies demonstrated that MMRV and Men C conjugate vaccines can be administered concomitantly without a negative impact on the safety and immunogenicity of either vaccines, inducing highly immunogenic responses.","['Bonanni P', 'Boccalini S', 'Bechini A', 'Varone O', 'Matteo G', 'Sandri F', 'Gabutti G']",2020,16,6,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Bonanni P, et al.

31800919,Impact of vaccination on the incidence of varicella hospitalizations in a state in Southeast Brazil.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to analyze cases of complicated varicella and the impact of varicella vaccination in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
METHODS: This was a time series study of a territorial basis using data on varicella cases from 2010 to 2016, which was provided by the State Health Department of Minas Gerais on . Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis, and the generalized linear regression model proposed by Prais-Winsten was used for the time tendency, adopting a significance level of 5% and the integrated autoregressive modeling of moving averages.
RESULTS: There were 1,635 cases of varicella; out of which cellulitis (44%) was the predominant complication. The home-acquired cases were 38.9% and 464 cases (40.6%) were not previously vaccinated. There was a significant decrease in the incidence coefficient when comparing the pre- and post- immunization periods, from 1.95 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2010 to 0.24 cases/100.000 inhabitants in 2016 (p<0.05). There was a higher incidence of cases recorded among males, with higher prevalence in the age group of 1-4 years (54.7%). Lethality was higher between 5-9 years of age (44%). Mortality was higher in the age group of 0-4 years and among females (2.58/100,000 inhabitants/year). The overall trend of the incidence coefficient was a decreasing one, with an annual percentage variation.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of complicated varicella cases notified decreased, coincidentally, in the post-immunization period. However, the immunization coverage period was restricted for the assessment of the correlation between immunization coverage and incidence.","['Dias AC', 'Rodrigues LR', 'Nunes AA', 'Castro SS']",2019,52,,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,"Dias AC, et al.

31794121,Insufficient awareness and vaccination practices for inflammatory bowel disease patients in China: A multi-center survey of Chinese gastroenterologists.,"OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been increasing worldwide, and the risk of infection has increased due to the use of immunosuppressive and biologic medications. Some of these infections can be prevented with vaccinations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vaccination practices of Chinese gastroenterologists for patients with IBD.
METHODS: Questionnaires based on quick response codes were sent using email and the WeChat platform to gastroenterologists at 20 hospitals in China. The vaccination practices of the gastroenterologists, including vaccinating for hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and varicella, were assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 468 gastroenterologists who received the questionnaire, 307 (65.6%) completed it. Of the gastroenterologists who were most concerned about hepatitis B; 83.4% always or frequently asked about an infection history, 53.7% took an immunization history, and 73.6% tested patients for hepatitis B infection. However, few gastroenterologists did so for hepatitis A or varicella. The proportion of patients who were asked about an infection and immunization history and tested for varicella infection was 16.0%, 15.0%, and 9.4%, respectively. Only a few gastroenterologists recommended vaccination for patients without an infection before IBD medical treatment (26.7% for hepatitis A, 45.6% for hepatitis B, and 28% for varicella vaccination).
CONCLUSION: Vaccination practices for patients with IBD used by Chinese gastroenterologists vary greatly, suggesting that education about immunization is needed.","['Li SY', 'Li PW', 'Shen B', 'Zhi M', 'Gu YB', 'Wang XY', 'Guo H', 'Li Y', 'Fan YH', 'Yang BL', 'Xue M', 'Wang XY', 'Lv MF', 'Li Y', 'Ye B', 'Zhu XJ', 'Chen Y']",2020,21,1,J Dig Dis,"Li SY, et al.

31780249,"Infectious diseases in post-trial detention and comparisons with pre-trial detention: A study in Geneva, Switzerland.","BACKGROUND: Prevalence rates of infectious diseases in post-trial prisons have been scarcely investigated. Due to the specific characteristics of these prison populations, these prevalence rates may differ from pre-trial prisons and more information is needed for developing adequate prevention and treatment interventions. This study compared prevalence rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), susceptibility to varicella zoster virus (VZV) and measles in pre- and post-trial detention.
METHODS: Data were collected in Geneva post-trial prisons among males (n=250), including serological tests, demographics, and risk factors, and were compared to those of the Geneva pre-trial prison (n=273).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Incarcerated men in post-trial detention shared a disproportionate burden of infectious diseases compared to community (chronic HBV: 5.9%, HVC: 2.8%, susceptibility to VZV: 5.9%, to measles: 4.7%). Susceptibility to VZV and prevalence rate of HCV were lower in post-trial prisons (p=.034 and p=.080). Prevalence rates of infectious diseases in prison should be interpreted in light of the prison population's characteristics. Screening and treatment should be promoted in all types of prison settings. Since overcrowding and turnover of pre-trial prisons restrict the access to screening, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, interventions are crucial in post-trial prisons.","['Baggio S', 'Chacowry Pala K', 'Rieder JP', 'Tran NT', 'Wolff H', 'Gétaz L']",2020,13,4,J Infect Public Health,"Baggio S, et al.

31776576,Assessment for varicella zoster virus in patients newly suspected of having giant cell arteritis.,"OBJECTIVES: There is uncertainty if varicella zoster virus (VZV) triggers GCA. This is based on discordant reports of VZV detection in GCA temporal artery biopsies. We conducted a multimodal evaluation for VZV in the inception Giant Cell Arteritis and PET Scan (GAPS) cohort.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent temporal artery biopsy for suspected GCA were clinically reviewed for active and past VZV infection and followed for 6 months. Serum was tested for VZV IgM and IgG. Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) sections were stained for VZV antigen using the VZV Mouse Cocktail Antibody (Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA, USA). A selection of GCA and control tissues were stained with the VZV gE antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), which was used in previous studies.
RESULTS: A total of 58 patients met inclusion criteria, 12 (21%) had biopsy-positive GCA and 20 had clinically positive GCA. None had herpes zoster at enrolment and only one patient developed a VZV clinical syndrome (zoster ophthalmicus) on follow-up. There was no difference in VZV exposure between GCA and non-GCA patients. None of the 53 patients who had VZV serology collected had positive VZV IgM antibodies. VZV antigen was not convincingly demonstrated in any of the TAB specimens; 57 TABs stained negative and 1 stained equivocally positive. The Santa Cruz Biotechnology VZV antibody exhibited positive staining in a range of negative control tissues, questioning its specificity for VZV antigen.
CONCLUSION: The absence of active infection markers argues against VZV reactivation being the trigger for GCA. Non-specific immunohistochemistry staining may account for positive findings in previous studies.","['Sammel AM', 'Smith S', 'Nguyen K', 'Laurent R', 'Brewer J', 'Hall N', 'Little CB']",2020,59,8,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Sammel AM, et al.

METHODS: We identified all cases during the outbreak. We described the outbreak epidemic course and examined the influence of the following variables on the outbreak: sleeping in the dormitory, eating in school, taking school transportation, hand-washing habits, morning examinations, and effectiveness of case isolation. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of contracting varicella.
RESULTS: A total of 92 varicella cases were reported, accounting for 5.53% (92/1663) of all students. Among cases, 64.13% (59/92) were vaccinated. The outbreak lasted for 93 days and occurred in six generations. Vaccination coverage was between 78.05% and 85.67%. The varicella vaccine was effective in 56.63% of recipients (95% CI: 35.49-70.84%). Vaccine effectiveness significantly decreased after 4-6 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The varicella vaccine was unable to prevent virus spread even with high vaccination coverage.

CONCLUSIONS: Acute VZV infection may present as fulminant hepatitis. The presentation may initially be challenging for the diagnosis and should be considered if the patient has been in contact with a sick case.

31761499,Vaccination coverage and immunity levels against vaccine-preventable diseases in male Air Force recruits in Greece.,"AIM: Data about susceptibility rates in young adults are scarce. We estimated the complete vaccination rates, timeliness of vaccinations and susceptibility rates among male military recruits in Greece.
METHODS: A standardized form was used to collect data. Immunity against measles, rubella, varicella, hepatitis A and hepatitis B was serologically estimated.
RESULTS: We studied 385 recruits with a mean age of 23.5 years (range: 18.3-29.9 years). Complete vaccination rates were 94.3% for measles, 100% for rubella, 15% for varicella, 73.9% for hepatitis A and 96.5% for hepatitis B. Only 10.8% of participants were fully vaccinated against all five diseases. Timely vaccination was 47.2% for measles, 89.3% for rubella and 48.1% for hepatitis B. Recruits >23 years had a 1.5-fold increased probability for incomplete vaccinations compared to younger recruits. Laboratory-confirmed immunity rates were 80% against measles, 85.7% against rubella, 85.2% against varicella, 69.4% against hepatitis A and 77.1% against hepatitis B. It is estimated that approximately 388,696 persons aged 18-30 years are susceptible to measles, 277,640 persons to rubella, 287,736 persons to varicella, 595,664 persons to hepatitis A and 444,224 persons to hepatitis B in Greece.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that young adults have significant immunity gaps against measles, rubella, varicella, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Complete vaccination rates were suboptimal against hepatitis A and varicella. Strategies to access young adults and increase immunity rates through catch-up vaccination services should be investigated.

Here, we describe an adult Japanese patient who was suffering from chickenpox caused by VZV type E, the most prevalent genotype in Western Europe. Because the eruptions were distributed over the trunk and limbs and the patient had a high titer of immunoglobulin G against VZV, we diagnosed this case as secondary VZV infection. To investigate the current prevalence of VZV genotypes in Japan, we examined the genotype of VZV in an additional 49 Japanese varicella/zoster patients who visited our hospital during 2018-2019. We found that VZV type E was still an exceptionally rare genotype (1/50) in Japan. Because foreign nationals living in Japan who carry VZV genotypes other than type J are increasing in number, secondary chickenpox may increase in Japan in the near future, as well as in the USA where multiple VZV genotypes are distributed.","['Egawa G', 'Egawa K', 'Kabashima K']",2020,47,1,J Dermatol,"Egawa G, et al.

31696946,Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is a neurocutaneous disease caused by the reactivation of the virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). After resolution of the varicella episode, the virus can remain latent in the sensitive dorsal ganglia of the spine. Years later, with declining immunity, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate and cause herpes zoster, an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity, and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of the VZV activates specific T-cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The USA Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus, live zoster vaccine (LZV), for clinical use amongst older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine, recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), has also been approved. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last updated in 2016.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.
SEARCH METHODS: For this 2019 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, January 2019), MEDLINE (1948 to January 2019), Embase (2010 to January 2019), CINAHL (1981 to January 2019), LILACS (1982 to January 2019), WHO ICTRP (on 31 January 2019) and ClinicalTrials.gov (on 31 January 2019).
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine (any dose and potency) versus any other type of intervention (e.g. varicella vaccine, antiviral medication), placebo, or no intervention (no vaccine). Outcomes were incidence of herpes zoster, adverse events (death, serious adverse events, systemic reactions, or local reaction occurring at any time after vaccination), and dropouts.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 new studies involving 18,615 participants in this update. The review now includes a total of 24 studies involving 88,531 participants. Only three studies assessed the incidence of herpes zoster in groups that received vaccines versus placebo. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries in Europe and North America and included healthy Caucasians (understood to be white participants) aged 60 years or over with no immunosuppressive comorbidities. Two studies were conducted in Japan. Fifteen studies used LZV. Nine studies tested an RZV. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Most data for the primary outcome (incidence of herpes zoster) and secondary outcomes (adverse events and dropouts) came from studies that had a low risk of bias and included a large number of participants. The incidence of herpes zoster at up to three years follow-up was lower in participants who received the LZV (one dose subcutaneously) than in those who received placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56; risk difference (RD) 2%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; moderate-quality evidence) in the largest study, which included 38,546 participants. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups for serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21) or deaths (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of one or more adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.11; RD 23%; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.3) and injection site adverse events (RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.93 to 7.21; RD 28%; NNTH 3.6) of mild to moderate intensity (moderate-quality evidence). These data came from four studies with 6980 participants aged 60 years or over. Two studies (29,311 participants for safety evaluation and 22,022 participants for efficacy evaluation) compared RZV (two doses intramuscularly, two months apart) versus placebo. Participants who received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years follow-up (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.23; RD 3%; NNTB 33; moderate-quality evidence). There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups in incidence of serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) or deaths (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; moderate-quality evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events, any systemic symptom (RR 2.23, 95% CI 2.12 to 2.34; RD 33%; NNTH 3.0), and any local symptom (RR 6.89, 95% CI 6.37 to 7.45; RD 67%; NNTH 1.5). Although most participants reported that there symptoms were of mild to moderate intensity, the risk of dropouts (participants not returning for the second dose, two months after the first dose) was higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; RD 1%; NNTH 100, moderate-quality evidence). Only one study reported funding from a non-commercial source (a university research foundation). All of the other included studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. We did not conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LZV and RZV are effective in preventing herpes zoster disease for up to three years (the main studies did not follow participants for more than three years). To date, there are no data to recommend revaccination after receiving the basic schedule for each type of vaccine. Both vaccines produce systemic and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity.","['Gagliardi AM', 'Andriolo BN', 'Torloni MR', 'Soares BG', 'de Oliveira Gomes J', 'Andriolo RB', 'Canteiro Cruz E']",2019,2019,11,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Gagliardi AM, et al.

31689349,Vaccinations and Immunization Status in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Multicenter Study From the Pediatric IBD Porto Group of the ESPGHAN.,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine-preventable diseases and opportunistic infections in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are increasingly recognized issues. The aims of this study were to evaluate vaccinations, immunization status, and consequent therapeutic management in children with IBD and to analyze the differences among patients diagnosed before (Group 1) and after June 2012 (Group 2).
METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort investigation. Between July 2016 and July 2017, 430 children with IBD were enrolled in 13 centers. Diagnosis, therapeutic history, vaccinations, and immunization status screening at diagnosis and at immunosuppressant (IM)/biologic initiation and reasons for incomplete immunization were retrieved.
RESULTS: Vaccination rates at diagnosis were unsatisfactory for measles, mumps, and rubella (89.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (81.9%), meningococcus C (23.5%), chickenpox (18.4%), pneumococcus (18.6%), papillomavirus (5.9%), and rotavirus (1.9%). Complete immunization was recorded in 38/430 (8.8%) children, but specific vaccines were recommended in 79/430 patients (18.6%), without differences between the 2 groups. At IM start, 22% of children were tested for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status, with 96.2% of EBV-naïve patients starting azathioprine, without differences between Groups 1 and 2. Screening for latent tuberculosis (TB) before start of biologics was performed in 175/190 (92.1%), with up to 9 different screening strategies and numerous inconsistencies.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a poor immunization status at diagnosis in children with IBD, which was not followed by proper vaccination catch-up. EBV status before IM initiation and latent TB before biologics were not adequately assessed. Thus, the overall impact of the current guidelines seems unsatisfactory.","['Martinelli M', 'Giugliano FP', 'Strisciuglio C', 'Urbonas V', 'Serban DE', 'Banaszkiewicz A', 'Assa A', 'Hojsak I', 'Lerchova T', 'Navas-López VM', 'Romano C', 'Sladek M', 'Veres G', 'Aloi M', 'Kucinskiene R', 'Miele E']",2020,26,9,Inflamm Bowel Dis,"Martinelli M, et al.

31659688,Increase in the genetic polymorphism of varicella-zoster virus after passaging in in vitro cell culture.,"Primary infections with the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) result in varicella, while latent reactivation leads to herpes zoster. Both varicella and zoster can be prevented by live attenuated vaccines. There have been reports suggesting that both clinical VZV strains and those in vaccine preparations are genetically polymorphic, containing mixtures of both wild-type and vaccine-type sequences at certain vaccine-specific sites. In this study, the genetic polymorphism of the VZV genome was examined by analyzing the frequencies of minor alleles at each nucleotide position. Next-generation sequencing of the clinical VZV strain YC02 passaged in an in vitro cell culture was used to identify genetically polymorphic sites (GPS), where the minor allele frequency (MAF) exceeded 5%. The number of GPS increased by 7.3-fold at high passages (p100) when compared to low passages (p17), although the average MAF remained similar. GPS were found in 6 open reading frames (ORFs) in p17, 35, and 54 ORFs in p60 and p100, respectively. GPS were found more frequently in the dispensable gene group than the essential gene group, but the average MAF was greater in the essential gene group. The most common two major/minor base pairs were A/g and T/c. GPS were found in all three passages at 16 positions, all located in the reiterated (R) region. The population diversity as measured by Shannon entropy increased in p60 and p100. However, the entropy remained unchanged in the R regions.","['Hwang HR', 'Kim SC', 'Kang SH', 'Lee CH']",2019,57,11,J Microbiol,"Hwang HR, et al.

31658769,Whole Transcriptome Analyses Reveal Differential mRNA and microRNA Expression Profiles in Primary Human Dermal Fibroblasts Infected with Clinical or Vaccine Strains of Varicella Zoster Virus.,"Licensed live attenuated vaccines have been developed to prevent varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, which causes chickenpox and shingles. The genomic sequences of both clinical- and vaccine-derived VZV strains have been analyzed previously. To further characterize the molecular signatures and complexity of wildtype (clinical) versus attenuated (vaccine-derived) VZV-mediated host cellular responses, we performed high-throughput next generation sequencing to quantify and compare the expression patterns of mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) infected with wildtype (YC01 low passage) and attenuated (YC01 high passage, SuduVax, and VarilRix) VZV strains. 3D-multidimensional scaling of the differentially expressed genes demonstrated the distinct grouping of wildtype and attenuated strains. In particular, we observed that HDFs infected with attenuated strains had more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the retinoic-acid inducible gene-I-like receptor and interferon-mediated signaling pathways compared with wildtype strains. Additionally, miRNA expression patterns were profiled following the infection of HDFs with VZV. Small RNA sequencing identified that several miRNAs were upregulated, including miR-146a-5p, which has been associated with other herpesvirus infections, whereas let-7a-3p was downregulated in both wildtype and attenuated VZV-infected cells. This study identified genes and miRNAs that may be essential in VZV pathogenesis.","['Oh SJ', 'Lim S', 'Song MJ', 'Ahn JH', 'Lee CH', 'Shin OS']",2019,8,4,Pathogens,"Oh SJ, et al.

31647159,"Serologic screening and infectious disease consultation (IDC): Indicated in heart, lung, liver (HLL) solid organ transplants (SOT) for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.","BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are a special group of patients who require comprehensive evaluation for preventable infectious diseases before transplantation. The main aim of our study was to investigate the number of heart, lung, and liver (HLL) transplant recipients who were evaluated for their immune status against measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and varicella (VZV). As a secondary aim, we investigated whether pre-transplant infectious disease consultation (IDC) improves vaccination rates.
METHODS: This study was an institution-based retrospective analysis of HLL transplant recipients born in or after 1957 and evaluated at Mayo Clinic, FL Transplant Center between January 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2017. Data collection was obtained from electronic medical records. The vaccination rates were compared by univariate analysis based on IDC and no ID consultation (NIDC).
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven (77%) of a total 242 patients received an IDC pre-transplantation. Varicella IgG levels were screened in all 187 IDC candidates. Among the 187 IDC patients, mumps, measles, and rubella IgG serologies were performed in 9 (5%), 21 (11%), and 51 (27%), respectively. Among all 242 patients, vaccines given included 2 (0.8%) MMR, 10 (4.1%) varicella and 85 (35.12%) Zostavax. Univariate analysis revealed that Zostavax was given to 76 (40.6%) pre-transplant IDC patients and only in 9 (16.7%) NIDC patients (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively high IDC rate, patients' screened numbers for MMR IgG levels were low. Results pointed out the need for MMR protocol-driven serologic screening as well as for VZV and IDC prior to transplantation to increase vaccination rates.","['Seckin ZI', 'Brumble LM', 'Libertin CR']",2020,22,1,Transpl Infect Dis,"Seckin ZI, et al.

31642729,Varicella vaccine dose depended effectiveness and waning among preschool children in Hong Kong.,"In Hong Kong, universal varicella vaccination was introduced in July 2014 with a two-dose schedule but the vaccines had been available in the private market since 1996. With data from varicella notification and surveys on immunization coverage, we used the screening method to estimate dose-specific varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) among preschool children in Hong Kong before universal vaccination. We estimated the VE of one- and two-dose varicella vaccination against all notified varicella as 69.4% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 69.5-71.2) and 93.4% (95% CI 91.7-94.7), respectively. We found that VE did not decrease with time since receipt. Varicella vaccine was more effective against complications (85.4% [95% CI 48.8-95.8] for one dose and 100% [95% CI -Inf to 100] for two doses) and against hospital admission (75.2% [95% CI 53.4-86.8] for one dose and 93.1% [95% CI 47.1-99.1] for two doses). Lower protection of one-dose varicella vaccine resulted in breakthrough varicella. Under universal vaccination, second-dose varicella vaccine (given as combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine) was first scheduled for children when they reach primary one (about 6 years of age) and was recently advanced to 18 months of age. Shortening the interval between the first dose and second dose of varicella vaccination should reduce breakthrough varicella and outbreaks in preschool.","['Chan YD', 'Edmunds WJ', 'Chan HL', 'Wong ML', 'Au KA', 'Chuang SK', 'van Hoek AJ', 'Flasche S']",2020,16,3,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Chan YD, et al.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted August 2015-November 2016 among 326 healthy nursing students aged 14.1-18.1 years. Serum IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results were analyzed by the Chi-square test; a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The number of seropositive participants (%) was 308 (94.5%) for rubella, 295 (90.5%) for VZV, 244 (74.9%) for measles, and 219 (67.2%) for mumps. A significant correlation was found between measles IgG and age. A relationship was also observed between VZV IgG and kindergarten attendance. Response rates to measles, rubella, VZV, and mumps vaccination were 96%, 92.3%, 87.5%, 78.8%, respectively. The total cost of vaccination after IgG screening was less than vaccination without screening.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, participants' immunity to measles and VZV was low. Prevaccination serological screening was cost-effectiveness method for preventing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella infections.

The incidence of pre-defined complications of varicella was estimated using ICD-10 codes. Inpatient costs were calculated based on the payment rules for providers of NHS services.ResultsThere were 61,024 admissions with varicella between 2004 and 2017 and 38.1% had a recognised varicella complication. Incidence of hospitalisation increased by 25% and the proportion with complicated varicella by 24% from 2004/05 to 2016/17. The most common complications were bacterial skin infections (11.25%), pneumonia (4.82%), febrile convulsions (3.39%) and encephalitis (2.44%). Complication rates were higher in older age groups and the type of complications more severe. Length of stay for complicated varicella was 3.1 times longer than for uncomplicated varicella and inpatient costs were 72% greater.ConclusionComplicated varicella has a substantial health and economic burden.

31626786,Kallikrein-Mediated Cytokeratin 10 Degradation Is Required for Varicella Zoster Virus Propagation in Skin.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a skin-tropic virus that infects epidermal keratinocytes and causes chickenpox. Although common, VZV infection can be life-threatening, particularly in the immunocompromized. Therefore, understanding VZV-keratinocyte interactions is important to find new treatments beyond vaccination and antiviral drugs. In VZV-infected skin, kallikrein 6 and the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 are upregulated concomitant with keratin 10 (KRT10) downregulation. MDM2 binds to KRT10, targeting it for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Preventing KRT10 degradation reduced VZV propagation in culture and prevented epidermal disruption in skin explants. KRT10 knockdown induced expression of NR4A1 and enhanced viral propagation in culture. NR4A1 knockdown prevented viral propagation in culture, reduced LC3 levels, and increased LAMP2 expression. We therefore describe a drug-able pathway whereby MDM2 ubiquitinates and degrades KRT10, increasing NR4A1 expression and allowing VZV replication and propagation.","['Tommasi C', 'Rogerson C', 'Depledge DP', 'Jones M', 'Naeem AS', 'Venturini C', 'Frampton D', 'Tutill HJ', 'Way B', 'Breuer J', ""O'Shaughnessy RFL""]",2020,140,4,J Invest Dermatol,"Tommasi C, et al.

31617171,Vaccines for Herpes Simplex: Recent Progress Driven by Viral and Adjuvant Immunology.,"Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) types 1 and 2 are ubiquitous. They both cause genital herpes, occasionally severe disease in the immunocompromised, and facilitate much HIV acquisition globally. Despite more than 60 years of research, there is no licensed prophylactic HSV vaccine and some doubt as to whether this can be achieved. Nevertheless, a previous HSV vaccine candidate did have partial success in preventing genital herpes and HSV acquisition and another immunotherapeutic candidate reduced viral shedding and recurrent lesions, inspiring further research. However, the entry pathway of HSV into the anogenital mucosa and the subsequent cascade of immune responses need further elucidation so that these responses could be mimicked or improved by a vaccine, to prevent viral entry and colonization of the neuronal ganglia. For an effective novel vaccine against genital herpes the choice of antigen and adjuvant may be critical. The incorporation of adjuvants of the vaccine candidates in the past, may account for their partial efficacy. It is likely that they can be improved by understanding the mechanisms of immune responses elicited by different adjuvants and comparing these to natural immune responses. Here we review the history of vaccines for HSV, those in development and compare them to successful vaccines for chicken pox or herpes zoster. We also review what is known of the natural immune control of herpes lesions, via interacting innate immunity and CD4 and CD8 T cells and the lessons they provide for development of new, more effective vaccines.","['Sandgren KJ', 'Truong NR', 'Smith JB', 'Bertram K', 'Cunningham AL']",2020,2060,,Methods Mol Biol,"Sandgren KJ, et al.

A major complication of HZ is a severe and often debilitating pain called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) which persists long after the resolution of the HZ-associated rash. The underlying cause of PHN is not known, although it has been postulated that it may be a consequence of immune cell mediated damage. However, the nature of virus-immune cell interactions within ganglia during PHN is unknown. We obtained rare formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections cut from surgically excised ganglia from a PHN-affected patient years following HZ rash resolution.

31567048,8 months to 5 days: what happened when Pennsylvania changed the vaccination regulations for provisional enrollment?,"In March 2017, the Pennsylvania Department of Health reduced the time allowed to demonstrate compliance with school-entry vaccination requirements from eight months to five days. We describe changes in provisional enrollment, vaccine exemptions, and vaccine coverage rates before and after the new regulation. Across Pennsylvania, provisional enrollment decreased from 11.1% in 2016/17 to 2.5% in 2017/18 (77% relative decrease). Personal belief exemptions continued a modest upward trend, similar to previous years, and medical exemptions remained steady. Among kindergartners, coverage with ≥ 2 doses of MMR vaccine and 2 doses of Varicella vaccine increased; similar increases were seen for the MCV and Tdap vaccines among 7th graders. However, improvements in coverage and reductions in provisional enrollment were not consistent across counties. Provisional enrollment in Philadelphia County during the 2017/18 school year (10.4%) did not substantially decrease. The statewide reduction in provisional enrollment suggests that the new regulations accomplished the goal of increasing the proportion of students who are up-to-date on required vaccines at the beginning of the school year without a significant increase in vaccine exemptions. However, the persistence of high provisional enrollment in some counties points to additional barriers to this goal in some schools and regions.","['Mohanty S', 'Delamater P', 'Feemster K', 'Buttenheim AM']",2020,16,5,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Mohanty S, et al. 8 months to 5 days: what happened when Pennsylvania changed the vaccination regulations for provisional enrollment?. 8 months to 5 days: what happened when Pennsylvania changed the vaccination regulations for provisional enrollment?. 2020; 16:1166-1170. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2019.1673120",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31567048/
31567045,Budget impact analysis of multiple varicella vaccination strategies: a Mexico perspective.,"A number of live-attenuated varicella vaccines are produced globally that provide protection against the varicella zoster virus. In Mexico, varicella vaccination is not included in the national immunization program and is recommended for use only in high-risk subgroups. We developed a budget impact model to estimate the impact of universal childhood immunization against varicella on the national payer system in Mexico. A scenario of no varicella vaccination was compared to scenarios with vaccination with a single dose at 13 months of age, in alignment with the existing program of immunization with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Nine different vaccination scenarios were envisioned, differing by vaccine type and by coverage. Varicella cases and treatment costs of each scenario were computed in a dynamic transmission model of varicella epidemiology, calibrated to the population of Mexico. Unit costs were based on Mexico sources or were from the literature. The results indicated that each of the three vaccine types increased vaccine acquisition and administration expenditures but produced overall cost savings in each of the first 10 years of the program, due to fewer cases and reduced varicella treatment costs. A highly effective vaccine at 95% coverage produced the greatest cost savings.","['Graham J', 'Wolfson LJ', 'Kyle J', 'Bolde-Villarreal CP', 'Guarneros-DeRegil DB', 'Monsanto H', 'Pillsbury M', 'Talbird S', 'Daniels VJ']",2020,16,4,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Graham J, et al.

31564452,"Healthcare workers' knowledge, beliefs, and coverage regarding vaccinations in critical care units in Italy.","BACKGROUND: Low rates of vaccine coverage have resulted in a resurgence of several vaccine-preventable diseases in many European countries. Routine vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) is important to reduce disease transmission, and to promote vaccine awareness and acceptance in the population. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to investigate knowledge and beliefs about vaccines and to evaluate self-reported immunization coverage with vaccines recommended for HCWs. Additionally, the effects of several factors on these outcomes have been evaluated.
METHODS: A survey was conducted between September and November 2018 among a random sample of HCWs in cardiac, adult, and neonatal critical care units of 8 randomly selected hospitals across the Campania and Calabria Regions in Italy. Multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis has been performed.
RESULTS: A total 531 HCWs returned the questionnaire for a response rate of 54.9%. Based on a vaccination knowledge score ranging from 0 to 9, more than half of the participants (55.4%) knew few of the vaccines recommended for HCWs (≤3 correct answers), 16.2% knew some vaccines (4-6 correct answers), and 28.4% knew most vaccines (≥7 correct answers), and only 13.2% knew all the vaccines recommended for HCWs. However, two-thirds (62.2%) knew that hepatitis B and influenza vaccines were recommended, and this knowledge was significantly higher among females (p < 0.001), among HCWs aged between 50 and 59 years (p = 0.01) compared with those aged < 30 years, and in those who search for information about recommended vaccines for HCWs (p = 0.012). The vaccine knowledge was significantly lower among nurses and nursing supporting staff compared with physicians (p = 0.032). Approximately two-thirds (62.7%) of HCWs considered themselves at risk of contracting vaccine-preventable infectious diseases during their professional practice. High rates of coverage were self-reported for hepatitis B (96.3%), tetanus and pertussis (93.7%), whereas they were lower for measles/mumps/rubella (80.5%), chickenpox (65.3%), and influenza (35.8%). Only 9.2% of HCWs reported prior receipt of all recommended vaccines. Male HCWs were less likely to report prior receipt of all recommended vaccines (p = 0.011). HCWs aged between 30 and 39 years compared with those aged < 30 years (p = 0.001) and those who knew some (p < 0.001) and most (p = 0.007) of all vaccines recommended for HCWs were more likely to self-report to be immunized.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional training about the vaccinations is needed to improve HCWs knowledge and to address specific concerns which may lead to better uptake among this group.","['Napolitano F', 'Bianco A', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Papadopoli R', 'Angelillo IF']",2019,37,46,Vaccine,"Napolitano F, et al.

31563283,"Frequency and cost of live vaccines administered too soon after prior live vaccine in children aged 12 months through 6 years, 2014-2017.","OBJECTIVE: To identify number of children who received live vaccines outside recommended intervals between doses and calculate corrective revaccination costs.
METHODS: We analyzed >1.6 million vaccination records for children aged 12 months through 6 years from six immunization information system (IIS) Sentinel Sites from 2014-15 when live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV, FluMist® Quadrivalent) was recommended for use, and from 2016-17, when not recommended for use. Depending on the vaccine, insufficient intervals between live vaccine doses are less than 24 or 28 days from a preceding live vaccine dose. Private and public purchase costs of vaccines were used to determine revaccination costs of live vaccine doses administered during the live vaccine conflict interval. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella, combined MMRV, and LAIV were live vaccines evaluated in this study.
RESULTS: Among 946,659 children who received at least one live vaccine dose from 2014-15, 4,873 (0.5%) received at least one dose too soon after a prior live vaccine (revaccination cost, $786,413) with a median conflict interval of 16 days. Among 704,591 children who received at least one live vaccine dose from 2016-17, 1,001 (0.1%) received at least one dose too soon after a prior live vaccine (revaccination cost, $181,565) with a median conflict interval of 14 days. The live vaccine most frequently administered outside of the recommended intervals was LAIV from 2014-15, and varicella from 2016-17.
CONCLUSIONS: Live vaccine interval errors were rare (0.5%), indicating an adherence to recommendations. If all invalid doses were corrected by revaccination over the two time periods, the cost within the IIS Sentinel Sites would be nearly one million dollars. Provider awareness about live vaccine conflicts, especially with LAIV, could prevent errors, and utilization of clinical decision support functionality within IISs and Electronic Health Record Systems can facilitate better vaccination practices.","['Kirtland KA', 'Lin X', 'Kroger AT', 'Myerburg S', 'Rodgers L']",2019,37,46,Vaccine,"Kirtland KA, et al.

31546692,Varicella Seroprevalence in Healthcare Workers at a Medical Center Following Changes in National and Local Hospital Vaccination Policies.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella seroprevalence in healthcare workers at a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan was assessed following the inclusion of varicella zoster vaccination in the national vaccination schedule in 2004 and was made a hospital policy in 2008.
METHODS: Seroprevalence data were extracted from records of pre-employment health check-ups performed between 2008 and 2018 at a single medical center. Staff with complete medical records and anti-varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin G (VZV IgG) titers were included. Sex and age group differences in terms of geometric mean titer (GMT) were compared using analysis of variance and chi-squared tests. The significance of the correlation between age and the anti-VZV IgG titer was tested by linear regression. The odds of significant associations among age, sex, vocation, and the years of national and hospital adoption of vaccination were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. 
RESULTS: Of the 7314 eligible participants, 5625 (76.90%) were women, and the mean patient age was 26.80 ± 8.00 years. The lowest VZV-positivity rates were in 18-20-year-old women (85.16%; GMT, 362.89 mIU/mL) and men (87.59%; GMT, 288.07 mIU/mL). VZV positivity increased with age (
CONCLUSIONS: Despite public health efforts, a small number of healthcare workers were inadequately protected, and antibody titers were lower than required to maintain herd immunity. For effective prevention of nosocomial infection, VZV IgG status should be documented for all HCWs, and susceptible HCWs should be vaccinated to avoid outbreaks. Pre-employment screening and vaccination have increased immunity and need to be conducted to ensure protection of vulnerable patients.","['Tsou MT', 'Shao HH']",2019,16,19,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Tsou MT and Shao HH.

Many people do not recognize the effectiveness of vaccination and fear the side effects. The main concern is the safety of vaccines. Lack of information weighs less than lack of trust in health authorities. The greater responsibility of the individual and the respect for his free will, may lead the authorities to a less vigourous promotion of the ""vaccination duty"" which is also a social duty. The attitude of individuals is guided by their health beliefs which are often supported by an erroneous perception of risk. In addition, insidious anti-vaccine lobbying plays on fears and uses biased reasoning that the media help to amplify. Thus the analysis of the brakes to vaccination both in the general population and among health professionals, the dismantling of the arguments developed by the anti-vaccine leagues and vigilance with regard to ""fake news"" should allow a concerted communication, transparent, clear and effective, in order to limit the occurrence of preventable deaths.",['Housset B'],2019,36,8,Rev Mal Respir,Housset B.

METHODS: Trends in school varicella outbreaks from 2006 to 2017 were assessed using joinpoint regression models. The impacts of changes in single-dose VarV coverage among schoolchildren and implementation of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategies on outbreak trends were further analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 265 varicella outbreaks involving 3263 cases were reported in Shanghai from 2006 to 2017. The number of outbreaks showed an increasing trend from 2006 to 2017 (t=2.62, p=0.026), especially in kindergartens. The proportion of breakthrough varicella cases among all outbreak-related cases showed an increasing trend from 30.4% in 2008 to 85.7% in 2017 (t=7.45, p<0.001). Single-dose VarV coverage among schoolchildren was 88.1%, and showed a significant increase from the 1996 to the 2008 birth cohorts, followed by a non-significant decline from the 2008 to the 2014 birth cohorts. During school outbreaks in which PEP campaigns were conducted, the varicella attack rate was significantly lower than those in outbreaks without PEP campaigns (1.2% vs. 1.4%; Chi-square=23.35, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Even with high coverage, single-dose VarV is insufficient to prevent school outbreaks. The administration of VarV as PEP is an appropriate intervention for varicella outbreak control prior to implementing a two-dose VarV schedule.","['Wu QS', 'Wang X', 'Liu JY', 'Chen YF', 'Zhou Q', 'Wang Y', 'Sha JD', 'Xuan ZL', 'Zhang LW', 'Yan L', 'Hu Y']",2019,89,,Int J Infect Dis,"Wu QS, et al.

They include human herpesviruses other than varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial and most other respiratory, enteric and arthropod-borne viruses. Improved oral poliovirus vaccines are also urgently required. Their unavailability is attributable to regulatory/economic factors and the properties of individual viruses, but also to an absence of relevant animal models and ethical problems for the conduct of clinical of trials in pediatric and other critical populations.

31491710,Reliability of direct varicella zoster virus loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid diagnosis of breakthrough varicella.,"BACKGROUND: Since patients with breakthrough varicella (BV) have mild symptoms, clinical diagnosis is difficult. In high vaccine coverage area, as BV occurs sporadically, point of care test is required for controlling varicella outbreak. In this study, the reliability of varicella zoster virus (VZV)-loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was evaluated for the rapid diagnosis of BV.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 328 swab samples collected from patients with suspected varicella were analyzed. For the laboratory diagnosis of varicella, VZV real-time PCR was carried out using DNA extracted from swab samples. Swab samples without DNA extraction were used for VZV-LAMP(direct-LAMP).
RESULTS: VZV infection was diagnosed by real-time PCR in 285 cases, including 105 natural varicella cases and 180 BV cases. VZV DNA was detected in 250 (87.8%) of the 285 cases by direct-LAMP. The presence and duration of fever, number of skin eruptions, and VZV DNA load were significantly lower in BV than natural varicella. The sensitivity of direct-LAMP for the diagnosis of varicella and BV was 93.3% and 84.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct LAMP was considered to be useful for rapid diagnosis of BV as it has several advantages such as low cost, ease and rapidity, as compared to real time PCR.","['Higashimoto Y', 'Kawamura Y', 'Kuboshiki A', 'Hattori F', 'Miura H', 'Nishimura N', 'Ozaki T', 'Ihira M', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Nagoya VZV study group']",2019,119,,J Clin Virol,"Higashimoto Y, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the characteristics of secondary transmission of the vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus (Oka strain; vOka) on the basis of the published experience with use of live varicella and zoster vaccines.
DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Scopus databases for articles published through 2018.
STUDY SELECTION: Articles that reported original data on vOka transmission from persons who received vaccines containing the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus.
DATA EXTRACTION: We abstracted data to describe vOka transmission by index patient's immune status, type (varicella or herpes zoster) and severity of illness, and whether transmission was laboratory confirmed.
RESULTS: Twenty articles were included. We identified 13 patients with vOka varicella after transmission from 11 immunocompetent varicella vaccine recipients. In all instances, the vaccine recipient had a rash: 6 varicella-like and 5 herpes zoster. Transmission occurred mostly to household contacts. One additional case was not considered direct transmission from a vaccine recipient, but the mechanism was uncertain. Transmission from vaccinated immunocompromised children also occurred only if the vaccine recipient developed a rash postvaccination. Secondary cases of varicella caused by vOka were mild.
LIMITATIONS: It is likely that other vOka transmission cases remain unpublished.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthy, vaccinated persons have minimal risk for transmitting vOka to contacts and only if a rash is present. Our findings support the existing recommendations for routine varicella vaccination and the guidance that persons with vaccine-related rash avoid contact with susceptible persons at high risk for severe varicella complications.","['Marin M', 'Leung J', 'Gershon AA']",2019,144,3,Pediatrics,"Marin M, et al.

31462576,"Granzyme B Cleaves Multiple Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) Gene Products, and VZV ORF4 Inhibits Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxicity.","Immune regulation of alphaherpesvirus latency and reactivation is critical for the control of virus pathogenesis. This is evident for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), where cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) prevent viral reactivation independent of apoptosis induction. This inhibition of HSV-1 reactivation has been attributed to granzyme B cleavage of HSV infected cell protein 4 (ICP4); however, it is unknown whether granzyme B cleavage of ICP4 can directly protect cells from CTL cytotoxicity. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is closely related to HSV-1; however, it is unknown whether VZV proteins contain granzyme B cleavage sites. Natural killer (NK) cells play a central role in VZV and HSV-1 pathogenesis and, like CTLs, utilize granzyme B to kill virally infected target cells. However, whether alphaherpesvirus granzyme B cleavage sites could modulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity has yet to be established. This study aimed to identify novel HSV-1 and VZV gene products with granzyme B cleavage sites and assess whether they could protect cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We have demonstrated that HSV ICP27, VZV open reading frame 62 (ORF62), and VZV ORF4 are cleaved by granzyme B. However, in an NK cell cytotoxicity assay, only VZV ORF4 conferred protection from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The granzyme B cleavage site in ORF4 was identified via site-directed mutagenesis and, surprisingly, the mutation of this cleavage site did not alter the ability of ORF4 to modulate NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that ORF4 has a novel immunoevasive function that is independent from the granzyme B cleavage site.","['Gerada C', 'Steain M', 'Campbell TM', 'McSharry B', 'Slobedman B', 'Abendroth A']",2019,93,22,J Virol,"Gerada C, et al.

She was clinically diagnosed with varicella zoster infection during the first visit. Surprisingly, she remained febrile even on day six of illness despite no new vesicular lesions on her skin. Due to suspicion of another infection, follow-up investigation was done and revealed isolated thrombocytopenia. This finding was confirmed with positive NS1Ag. A case of rare dengue fever concomitant with varicella zoster infection was reported.","['Shaiful Ehsan SM', 'Iskandar FO', 'Mohd Ashraf AR']",2019,74,4,Med J Malaysia,"Shaiful Ehsan SM, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, an institutional outbreak from Chandigarh, India, is reported wherein the utility of non-invasive samples such as saliva and urine was studied for the molecular diagnosis of varicella by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR and real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (real-time LAMP).
RESULTS: The results of the present study showed that saliva and urine samples can be used for outbreak investigation of varicella compared to varicella-zoster virus DNA in vesicular swab samples with reasonable sensitivity.
CONCLUSION: Thus, molecular techniques may be useful in the early identification of the outbreak and timely isolation, and the treatment of cases can further prevent its spread.","['Singh MP', 'Rungta T', 'Kumar A', 'Goyal K', 'Bharti B', 'Ratho RK']",2019,37,1,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Singh MP, et al.

Characterization of the panel using U.S. FDA-cleared commercial kits shows good concordance for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster with average sensitivity across assays of 94.9% and an average specificity of 91.4%. As expected, performance versus available standards validated for plaque-reduction assays does not provide a 1:1 correspondence with international units and yet demonstrates excellent linearity (average Hill's slope = 1.02) and ∼4 logs of dynamic range. In addition, for the four assays, the multiplexed format allowed for inclusion of three positive and two negative controls for each sample. A prototype Dynex Multiplier chemiluminescent automated immunoassay instrument with a charge-coupled device camera provided a rugged and robust processing and data acquisition platform. Performance of a multiplex instrument for serological testing in a substantially resource-limited environment shows excellent reproducibility, minimal cross-reactivity, and a clear discrimination between specific assays and should be considered a viable option for future serosurveys.","['Higgins SG', 'Hoff NA', 'Gadoth A', 'Fusellier A', 'Mukadi P', 'Alfonso V', 'Randall C', 'Ashbaugh H', 'Poncheri M', 'Doshi RH', 'Gerber S', 'Budd R', 'Wolfert R', 'Williams R', 'Okitolonda-Wemakoy E', 'Muyembe-Tamfum JJ', 'Rimoin AW']",2019,4,4,mSphere,"Higgins SG, et al.

31408505,Cost-effectiveness analysis of universal varicella vaccination in Turkey using a dynamic transmission model.,"BACKGROUND: In 2013, Turkey introduced one-dose universal varicella vaccination (UVV) at 12 months of age. Inclusion of a second dose is being considered.
METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model to evaluate three vaccination strategies: single dose at 12 months (1D) or second dose at either 18 months (2D-short) or 6 years of age (2D-long). Costs and utilization were age-stratified and separated into inpatient and outpatient costs for varicella and herpes zoster (HZ). We ran the model including and excluding HZ-related costs and impact of exogenous boosting.
RESULTS: Five years post-introduction of UVV (1D), the projected varicella incidence rate decreases from 1,674 cases pre-vaccine to 80 cases/100,000 person-years. By 25 years, varicella incidence equilibrates at 39, 12, and 16 cases/100,000 person-years for 1D, 2D-short, and 2D-long strategies, respectively, using a highly effective vaccine. With or without including exogenous boosting impact and/or HZ-related costs and health benefits, the 1D strategy is least costly, but 2-dose strategies are cost-effective considering a willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to the gross domestic product. The model predicted a modest increase in HZ burden during the first 20-30 years, after which time HZ incidence equilibrates at a lower rate than pre-vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support adding a second varicella vaccine dose in Turkey, as doing so is highly cost-effective across a wide range of assumptions regarding the burden associated with varicella and HZ disease.","['Wolfson LJ', 'Daniels VJ', 'Pillsbury M', 'Kurugöl Z', 'Yardimci C', 'Kyle J', 'Dinleyici EC']",2019,14,8,PLoS One,"Wolfson LJ, et al.

While it is well substantiated that VZV persistence is established in neurons after the primary infection (varicella or chickenpox), we know little of the types of neurons harboring latent virus genomes, if all can potentially reactivate, what exactly drives the reactivation process, and the role of immunity in the control of latency. Viral gene expression during latency has been particularly difficult to resolve, although very recent advances indicate that it is more restrictive than was once thought. We do not yet understand how genes expressed in latency function in the maintenance and reactivation processes. Model systems of latency are needed to pursue these questions.

31394276,Recombinant Zoster Vaccine Significantly Reduces the Impact on Quality of Life Caused by Herpes Zoster in Adult Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial (ZOE-HSCT).,"Herpes zoster (HZ) can have a substantial impact on quality of life (QoL). The vaccine efficacy (VE) of a recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was 68.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6% to 77.5%) in a phase 3 study in adult autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients (NCT01610414). Herein, we report the impact of RZV on patients' QoL. Autologous HSCT recipients were randomized 1:1 to receive 2 doses of RZV or placebo, given 1 to 2 months apart. QoL was measured by the Short Form Survey-36 and Euro-QoL-5 Dimension at baseline, 1 month, and 1 year postdose 2 and during suspected HZ episodes with the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI). The RZV impact on ZBPI burden of illness and burden of interference scores was estimated. The 2 scores were calculated from the area under the curve (days 0 to 182) of the ZBPI worst pain and ZBPI activities of daily living scores, respectively, assuming a score of 0 for patients not having a confirmed HZ episode. The ZBPI maximum worst pain score was significantly lower in the RZV than placebo group (mean: 5.8 versus 7.1, P = .011). Consequently, the VE estimates for HZ burden of illness (82.5%; 95% CI, 73.6 to 91.4) and burden of interference (82.8%; 95% CI, 73.3 to 92.3) were higher than the HZ VE estimate (ie, 68.2%). RZV showed significantly better QoL scores than placebo 1 week following rash onset among patients with confirmed HZ. In addition to reducing the risk of HZ and its complications, RZV significantly reduced the impact of HZ on patients' QoL in those who developed breakthrough disease.","['Curran D', 'Matthews S', 'Rowley SD', 'Young JH', 'Bastidas A', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Barista I', 'Chandrasekar PH', 'Dickinson M', 'El Idrissi M', 'Heras I', 'Milliken ST', 'Monserrat Coll J', 'Navarro Matilla MB', 'Oostvogels L', 'Piątkowska-Jakubas B', 'Quiel D', 'Sabry W', 'Schwartz S', 'Selleslag DLD', 'Sullivan KM', 'Theunissen K', 'Yegin ZA', 'Yeh SP', 'Zaja F', 'Szer J', 'ZOE-HSCT Study group collaborators']",2019,25,12,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,"Curran D, et al.

31377077,"The changing epidemiology of herpes zoster over a decade in South Korea, 2006-2015.","BACKGROUND: In South Korea, the population is rapidly aging and the prevalence of comorbidities has increased. We investigated longitudinal changes in the herpes zoster (HZ) considering demographic changes and comorbidities in the era of universal single-dose varicella vaccination.
METHODS: We used the population-based database of the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea, with approximately 50 million subscribers during 2006-2015. HZ cases were identified using ICD-10 codes and comorbid conditions were also collected. Incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) per year were calculated adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and socioeconomic status, and the temporal trends were examined using segmented negative binomial regression analysis.
RESULTS: Over a decade, the adjusted HZ IR increased significantly from 4.23 to 9.22 per 1000 person-years (adjusted IRR 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.06). However, during 2012-2015, the increasing trends decelerated (adjusted IRR per year 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.04) and slope changes differed by age. There was a declining trend in children under 9 years, sustained increase in adults aged 30-39 years, and near-plateau in those aged 50-69 years. Nonetheless, the age distribution of HZ incidence did not change over a decade, with the peak in adults aged 60-79 years. HZ-associated hospitalization rates also increased, with a deceleration in the increasing trends during 2012-2015.
CONCLUSIONS: The HZ burden increased independently of demographic changes and prevalence of comorbidities. However, different trajectories by age group necessitate continuous HZ surveillance for better understanding of these changes, and to provide evidence for development of preventive strategies.","['Choi JK', 'Park SH', 'Park S', 'Cho SY', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim SH', 'Choi SM', 'Lee DG', 'Choi JH', 'Yoo JH']",2019,37,36,Vaccine,"Choi JK, et al.

Both epidemiology and economic data on the burden of varicella were limited and varied significantly. Most of the data focussed on varicella burden in the absence of a UVV program. In the absence of UVV, varicella incidence is increasing across this region with varicella infection associated with substantial morbidity. Although limited, data on the impact of vaccination at a population level indicated UVV programs reduce varicella incidence and hospitalizations, in line with global experience. Further research and action are needed to better understand varicella epidemiology in the Middle East, increase awareness and understanding in the region, and provide local data to support national public-health decisions regarding the implementation of UVV programs.","['Al Kaabi N', 'Al Olama FMAS', 'Al Qaseer M', 'Al Ubaidani I', 'Dinleyici EC', 'Hayajneh WA', 'Bizri AR', 'Loulou M', 'Ndao T', 'Wolfson LJ']",2020,16,1,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Al Kaabi N, et al.

Moreover, evidence from seroprevalence studies for the same diseases were also included. The literature review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 1795 cases (115 outbreaks, 7 case reports) were identified, the majority were among crew (1466/1795, 81.7%) and were varicella cases (1497, 83.4%). The origin of crew cases was from sub-tropical countries in many reports. Measles (40 cases, 69% among crew), rubella (47, 88.7%), herpes zoster (9, 69.2%) and varicella cases (1316, 87.9%) were more frequent among crew.

31339679,Shingrix for Herpes Zoster: A Review.,"Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, results from reactivation of the latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which commonly causes chickenpox in childhood. Greater than 90% of adults are infected with this virus, putting them at risk for reactivation. HZ presents as a painful, vesicular rash distributed in a unilateral and dermatomal pattern along dorsal root or cranial nerve ganglia. The rash often presents with prodromal symptoms and progresses to include clear vesicular clusters, evolving through stages of pustulation, ulceration, and crusting. HZ therapy currently involves the use of antiviral agents and pain management; however, HZ prophylaxis has been strongly recommended in older adults through vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine, Zostavax®. A new recombinant subunit vaccine, HZ/su (Shingrix®), is the subject of this review. In clinical trials, HZ/su demonstrated an overall vaccine efficacy of 97.2% among participants 50 years of age or older, indicating a significantly reduced risk of HZ in these individuals. Shingrix® was approved by the US FDA in October 2017 as HZ prophylaxis.","['Shah RA', 'Limmer AL', 'Nwannunu CE', 'Patel RR', 'Mui UN', 'Tyring SK']",2019,24,4,Skin Therapy Lett,"Shah RA, et al.

31335765,Long-term Seroprotection of Varicella-zoster Immunization in Pediatric Liver Transplant Recipients.,"BACKGROUND: Chickenpox is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease that can lead to severe complications, especially in immunocompromised patients. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine appears to be safe and immunogenic in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients, but there are few data on the long-term vaccine-induced seroprotection.
METHODS: In this prospective interventional study, we offered 2 doses of VZV vaccine to all eligible and nonseroprotected children seen 1 year after liver transplant. Vaccine responses were measured 1 month later and yearly thereafter. Vaccine safety was closely monitored. A supplementary dose was administered if protective levels were not reached/maintained.
RESULTS: Among 121 enrolled patients, 49 were vaccinated and followed during 5.5 years (interquartile range, 3.7-8.0). Their seroconversion rate reached 100% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 92.7-100). Low VZV-antibody concentration (≤400 UI/L) after the first 1-2 dose/s was associated with the need for a supplementary dose (odds ratio, 15.0; 95% CI, 3.4-67.0, P = 0.001) and was given to 31% (15/47) of children at 1.1 year (interquartile range, 0.9-3.9). Although antibody concentrations declined during follow-up, 96% (95% CI, 86.0-99.5) of patients maintained protective antibody concentrations at a median of 5.5 years after vaccination. One breakthrough disease was identified.

This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of children who presented with ataxia of less than 72 h duration, over the last 12 years. Associated signs and symptoms, laboratory, EEG and neuroimaging studies, final diagnosis and clinical findings at discharge and during follow-up were studied. A total of 58 patients (35 boys, 23 girls), mean age 4.9 ± 3.8 years, were enrolled. The most common etiology of acute ataxia in our study was post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia (50%). Children diagnosed with post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia were significantly younger (3.48 ± 2.23 vs. 6.5 ± 3.1 years, p = 0.01), as compared with children diagnosed with infection and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. 86% of children with post-infectious cerebellar ataxia were younger than 5 years of age. The abnormality yield of work-up studies performed in our cohort was 39% for lumbar puncture, 36% for EEG, 7% for CT scan. MRI was done in children who showed extra cerebellar signs, when vascular or demyelinating diseases were suspected and in children with prolonged symptoms and was abnormal in 8 (14%) children. We conclude that post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia remains the most common cause of acute ataxia in children. Although lumbar puncture and neuroimaging should be considered in all children with acute cerebellar ataxia, younger children with a history of previous viral illness and no extra cerebellar signs and symptoms may benefit from watchful waiting.","['Segal E', 'Schif A', 'Kasis I', 'Ravid S']",2019,68,,J Clin Neurosci,"Segal E, et al.

CASE DESCRIPTION: A previously healthy 3-month-old female infant with 10-day history of varicella was admitted to the hospital for fever, groan and prostration. The initial laboratorial evaluation was compatible with bacterial sepsis. By the third day after admission, a swelling of the seventh left rib had developed. The ultrasound and scintigraphy evaluation suggested rib osteomyelitis. Blood cultures were negative. The patient completed six weeks of antibiotics with favorable clinical, laboratorial and imaging evolution.
COMMENTS: Varicella is one of the most frequent exanthematic diseases of childhood and it is usually self-limited. The most frequent complication is bacterial infection of cutaneous lesions. Osteoarticular complications are rare, and rib osteomyelitis is described in less than 1% of cases. The main route of dissemination is hematogenic, and the most frequent etiological agent is Staphylococcus aureus. The prognosis is generally good and depends on early detection and antibiotic initiation.","['Luís MS', 'Cardosa F', 'Reis F', 'Fraga AS', 'Victor M', 'Santos JG', 'Calhau P']",2019,37,4,Rev Paul Pediatr,"Luís MS, et al.

31277589,Nosocomial transmission of chickenpox and varicella zoster virus seroprevalence rate amongst healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in China.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a highly contagious herpesvirus with potential for nosocomial transmission. However, the importance of nosocomial chickenpox outbreak in China has often been ignored. With the increasing immunocompromised population in China, a thorough review of issues related to nosocomial transmission and the seroprevalence rate of VZV among healthcare workers is necessary.
METHODS: Retrospective case finding for nosocomial transmission of chickenpox was conducted between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017. Cases were identified based on clinical features compatible with chickenpox. A cross-sectional study on the seroprevalence rate of VZV among healthcare workers (HCWs) was conducted between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2017. The serum VZV antibodies of 1804 HCWs were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The seroprevalence rate of VZV antibodies, the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of self-reported history of varicella were analyzed. The economic impact associated with nosocomial transmission of VZV was also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 8 cases of chickenpox were identified in three nosocomial transmissions, including 4 HCWs who were infected nosocomially. The overall seroprevalence rate of VZV was 88.4%, which significantly increased with age (P < 0.01). The seroprevalence rates of HCWs with different genders and occupations showed no statistically significant differences. The positive and negative predictive values of a self-reported history of varicella were 80.8 and 10.6% respectively. An estimation of 163.3 person-days of work were lost in each nosocomial transmission and 86.7 infection control unit person-hours were required for each outbreak investigation. The cost of VZV IgG ELISA screening was estimated to be 83 USD per nosocomial transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial transmission of VZV occurred repeatedly in the hospital setting. An alarming 11.6% of HCWs were seronegative for VZV, which might increase the risk of nosocomial infection and outbreak for other susceptible co-workers and patients. This is especially important in the setting of a teaching hospital where many immunocompromised patients were managed. Furthermore, the positive predictive value of self-reported varicella on seroprevalence rate in our study was lower than those reported in other countries, therefore serological testing of VZV antibodies with subsequent vaccination for all non-immune HCWs should be considered.","['Yang J', 'Liu J', 'Xing F', 'Ye H', 'Dai G', 'Liu M', 'Lo SK', 'Lau RW', 'Chiu KH', 'Chan JF', 'Yuen KY']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Yang J, et al.

31271831,Estradiol Acts in Lateral Thalamic Region to Attenuate Varicella Zoster Virus Associated Affective Pain.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) results in chicken pox and herpes zoster. Female rats show a higher level of herpes zoster associated pain than males, consistent with human studies. In this study, we addressed the novel hypothesis that sex difference in herpes zoster associated pain is due, in part, to estradiol modulating activity in the thalamus. To test this hypothesis a high and low physiological dose of estradiol was administered to castrated and ovariectomized rats and the affective pain response was measured after injection of VZV into the whisker pad. Thalamic infusion of the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 concomitant with a high dose of estradiol addressed the role of estradiol binding to its receptor to effect pain. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (pERK) positive cells were measured in excitatory (glutaminase positive) and inhibitory (glutamate decarboxylase 67 positive) cells of the lateral thalamic region. Our results show that a high dose of estradiol significantly reduced the pain response in both males and females. pERK significantly increased in excitatory cells after treatment with a low dose of estradiol and increased in inhibitory cells after treatment with a high dose of estradiol. Administration of ICI 182,780 significantly increased the pain response, reduced expression of GABA related genes in the thalamic region and significantly reduced the number of inhibitory cells expressing pERK. The results suggest that estradiol attenuates herpes zoster pain by increasing the activity of inhibitory neurons within the thalamus and that this reduction includes an estrogen receptor dependent mechanism.","['Stinson C', 'Logan SM', 'Bellinger LL', 'Rao M', 'Kinchington PR', 'Kramer PR']",2019,414,,Neuroscience,"Stinson C, et al.

31263790,Management of varicella in neonates and infants.,"In countries where vaccination is not implemented, varicella is a common ubiquitous disease offering a broad range of clinical presentations. Whereas mother-to-child perinatal transmission of varicella zoster virus (VZV) can lead to disseminated life-threatening diseases in unimmunised newborns, postnatal acquisition will be generally a source of milder infections. The pattern and severity of the disease are known to be partly determined by the timing of VZV acquisition during pregnancy with the highest risk period located around delivery. Management of youngest children after contact with a varicella case remains difficult for clinicians not only because of unawareness of varicella natural history and risks factors for serious complications, but also because of the lack of consensus from experts available in the literature. This state of uncertainty often leads to overconsumption of healthcare resources with systematic hospitalisation and unjustified antiviral intravenous therapies. After a concise literature review, this article proposes pragmatic recommendations considering newborns in various scenarios following a contact with VZV, taking into account the timing and mode of virus transmission, the maternal immunological status, the baby's gestational age and the presence of other underlying conditions.","['Blumental S', 'Lepage P']",2019,3,1,BMJ Paediatr Open,Blumental S and Lepage P.

31242875,The use of antibiotics in the treatment of pediatric varicella patients: real-world evidence from the multi-country MARVEL study in Latin America & Europe.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is a highly contagious childhood disease. Generally benign, serious complications necessitating antibiotic use may occur. The objective of this study was to characterize the rate, appropriateness and patterns of real-world antibiotic prescribing for management of varicella-associated complications, prior to universal varicella vaccination (UVV) implementation.
METHODS: Pooled, post-hoc analysis of 5 international, multicenter, retrospective chart reviews studies (Argentina, Hungary, Mexico, Peru, Poland). Inpatient and outpatient primary pediatric (1-14 years) varicella cases, diagnosed between 2009 and 2016, were eligible. Outcomes, assessed descriptively, included varicella-associated complications and antibiotic use. Three antibiotic prescribing scenarios were defined based on complication profile in chart: evidence of microbiologically confirmed bacterial infection (Scenario A); insufficient evidence confirming microbiological confirmation (Scenario B); no evidence of microbiological confirmation (Scenario C). Stratification was performed by patient status (inpatient vs. outpatient) and country.
RESULTS: Four hundred one outpatients and 386 inpatients were included. Mean (SD) outpatient age was 3.6 (2.8) years; inpatient age was 3.1 (2.8) years. Male gender was predominant. Overall, 12.2% outpatients reported ≥1 infectious complication, 3.7% ≥1 bacterial infection, and 0.5% ≥1 microbiologically confirmed infection; inpatient complication rates were 78.8, 33.2 and 16.6%, respectively. Antibiotics were prescribed to 12.7% of outpatients and 68.9% of inpatients. Among users, β-lactamases (class), and clindamycin (agent), dominated prescriptions. Scenario A was assigned to 3.9% (outpatients) vs 13.2% (inpatients); Scenario B: 2.0% vs. 6.0%; Scenario C: 94.1% vs. 80.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: High rates of infectious complications and antibiotic use are reported, with low rates of microbiological confirmation suggesting possible antibiotic misuse for management of varicella complications.","['Wolfson LJ', 'Castillo ME', 'Giglio N', 'Mészner Z', 'Molnár Z', 'Vàzquez M', 'Wysocki J', 'Altland A', 'Kuter BJ', 'Stutz M', 'Rampakakis E', 'Roberts CS']",2019,19,1,BMC Public Health,"Wolfson LJ, et al.

Herein, we report on a case of disseminated varicella zoster infection after post-partum vaccination in a patient found to have CD4 lymphopenia and eventually diagnosed with ALPS caused by a novel germline missense mutation in FAS death-domain. A subsequent retrospective analysis of 169 patients of the NIH ALPS-FAS cohort, revealed that CD4-T-cells lymphopenia (< 300 cells/μl) may occur in 5% of ALPS-FAS patients irrespectively of the underlying genetic defect, organomegaly or immunosuppressive treatment. Although immunophenotyping did not show depletion of specific CD4-T-cells subpopulations, CD4-lymphopenic ALPS-FAS subjects had an expansion of a subset of circulating T-follicular-helper (cTfh) cells, associated with autoantibody production (CCR7lowPD-1high). Furthermore, autoantibodies binding on CD4-T-cells were detected in 50% of the CD4-lymphopenic ALPS-FAS patients and caused cytotoxicity in a natural killer (NK)-mediated antibody-dependent-cellular cytotoxicity assay. Such autoantibodies can therefore be associated with CD4-T-cell death, impaired activation induced proliferation or impaired trafficking. The expansion of autoreactive T-cells in ALPS-FAS is known to be associated with autoimmune clinical manifestations, however our study reveals that ALPS-FAS can also be associated with a paradoxical depletion of CD4-T-cells due to the presence of autoantibodies on the surface of CD4-T-cells which can in turn result in increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. These novel findings have implications for the diagnosis, clinical monitoring, and management of patients with ALPS-FAS.","['Lisco A', 'Wong CS', 'Price S', 'Ye P', 'Niemela J', 'Anderson M', 'Richards E', 'Manion M', 'Mystakelis H', 'Similuk M', 'Lo B', 'Stoddard J', 'Rosenzweig S', 'Vanpouille C', 'Rupert A', 'Maric I', 'Perez-Diez A', 'Parenti D', 'Burbelo PD', 'Rao VK', 'Sereti I']",2019,10,,Front Immunol,"Lisco A, et al.

31159224,Current In Vivo Models of Varicella-Zoster Virus Neurotropism.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), an exclusively human herpesvirus, causes chickenpox and establishes a latent infection in ganglia, reactivating decades later to produce zoster and associated neurological complications. An understanding of VZV neurotropism in humans has long been hampered by the lack of an adequate animal model. For example, experimental inoculation of VZV in small animals including guinea pigs and cotton rats results in the infection of ganglia but not a rash. The severe combined immune deficient human (SCID-hu) model allows the study of VZV neurotropism for human neural sub-populations. Simian varicella virus (SVV) infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely resembles both human primary VZV infection and reactivation, with analyses at early times after infection providing valuable information about the extent of viral replication and the host immune responses. Indeed, a critical role for CD4 T-cell immunity during acute SVV infection as well as reactivation has emerged based on studies using RM. Herein we discuss the results of efforts from different groups to establish an animal model of VZV neurotropism.","['Mahalingam R', 'Gershon A', 'Gershon M', 'Cohen JI', 'Arvin A', 'Zerboni L', 'Zhu H', 'Gray W', 'Messaoudi I', 'Traina-Dorge V']",2019,11,6,Viruses,"Mahalingam R, et al.

Despite substantial health burden associated with both diseases, their economic impact is not well described. The aim of the present study was to document the healthcare costs associated with both conditions in a Norwegian setting.
METHODS: We used registry data about patients' contacts with primary and specialized healthcare services from 2008 to 2014 to estimate the costs associated with varicella and herpes zoster in the primary and hospital care sector. We calculated the individual costs by treatment facility (general practitioner and emergency primary care clinic) in primary care and by treatment level (inpatient, outpatient or ambulatory treatment) at hospitals.
RESULTS: We estimate that the annual healthcare cost of patients with varicella and herpes zoster are NOK 85 million (approximately € 9 million). Of the annual costs, 73% are associated with herpes zoster and 27% are due to varicella. The majority (54%) of the total annual cost is represented by patients with herpes zoster treated in hospital.

31140131,Honeysuckle-derived microRNA2911 directly inhibits varicella-zoster virus replication by targeting IE62 gene.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) leads to chicken pox on primary infection and herpes zoster on reactivation. Recent studies suggest that microRNA2911 (MIR2911), honeysuckle (HS)-encoded atypical microRNA, has potential as a therapeutic agent against influenza and EV71 virus infections. Here, we report that MIR2911 directly inhibits VZV replication by targeting the IE62 gene. The luciferase reporter assay and bioinformatics prediction revealed that MIR2911 could target the IE62 gene of VZV. The VZV-encoded IE62 protein expression was inhibited significantly by synthetic MIR2911, while the expression of the mutants, whose MIR2911-binding sites were modified, was not inhibited. The RNA extracted from HS decoction and synthetic MIR2911 considerably suppressed VZV infection. However, it did not influence viral replication of a mutant virus with alterations in the nucleotide sequences of IE62. At the same time, the RNA extracted from HS decoction treated with the anti-MIR2911 antagomir could not inhibit the VZV replication, demonstrating that VZV replication was specifically and sufficiently inhibited by MIR2911. These results indicated that, by targeting the IE62 gene, MIR2911 may effectively inhibit VZV replication. Our results also suggest a potential novel strategy for the treatment and prevention of diseases caused by VZV infection.","['Huang Y', 'Liu H', 'Sun X', 'Ding M', 'Tao G', 'Li X']",2019,25,4,J Neurovirol,"Huang Y, et al.

Severe neurologic dysfunctions can occur in immunocompromised patients such as encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis and neuropathy. Longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is an unusual neurological complication mainly described in immunocompromised patients, with very few cases described in immunocompetent ones. We hereby report a case of VZV-induced LETM in an immunocompetent older adult-a situation rarely described in the literature. LETM is a rare complication of VZV and its pathogenesis; therapeutic interventions and prognosis are far from being fully clarified. However, a prompt diagnosis is needed to allow a rapid initialization of treatment and ensure a better outcome. Although the therapeutic lines are not clear, immunosuppressive agents may have their place in cases of unsuccessful results and/or relapses following acyclovir coupled with a well conducted methylprednisolone therapy.

31068173,Burden of varicella in Latin America and the Caribbean: findings from a systematic literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is typically mild and self-limiting, but can be associated with complications and even death. The limited data available on varicella in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) indicate substantial burden in countries where varicella vaccine is not part of publicly funded childhood national immunization programs.
METHODS: A systematic literature review of published studies was complemented by ""gray"" literature on varicella incidence, complications, mortality, and economic consequences, in the absence and presence of universal varicella vaccination (UVV) in LAC.
RESULTS: Seroprevalence data indicate that varicella is usually a disease of childhood in LAC. Varicella incidence rates, while unreliable in the absence of mandatory reporting, show a trend to increased incidence due to greater urbanization and population density. The introduction of UVV in national immunization programs has led to significant reductions in varicella incidence in these areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella continues to pose a substantial healthcare burden in LAC. The future introduction of UVV in additional countries is predicted to provide substantial reductions in cases, with important economic benefits. For countries that have already implemented UVV, the challenge is to maintain high rates of coverage and, where relevant, consider inclusion of a second dose to reduce breakthrough cases.

31068140,Varicella zoster and fever rash surveillance in Lao People's Democratic Republic.,"BACKGROUND: In Lao PDR, the epidemiology of varicella infection is uncertain, since it is not a notifiable disease and VZV outbreaks are rarely reported as fever/rash (F/R) diseases.
METHODS: We estimated the seroprevalence of VZV (IgG ELISA) in different age cohorts (9 months to 46 years; N = 3139) and investigated VZV and 6 other viruses in patients during F/R outbreaks and in an ad hoc sentinel site in the context of the national reporting system (IgM ELISA, PCR).
RESULTS: At least 80% of the sampled population had evidence of VZV infection before the age of 15. The largest increase in seroprevalence occurred between the age groups 1 to 5 and 6 to 7 year-olds. A VZV outbreak (clade 2) also occurred in this age group mostly during the first year of primary school (median age 6 years, interquartile range 4.0-7.5). During a dengue outbreak, 6% had varicella. At our F/R sentinel site, 14% of children with viral etiology were laboratory diagnosed as varicella and among others, a sizeable number of measles (N = 12) and rubella cases (N = 25) was detected compared to those reported for the whole country (N = 56 and 45), highlighting nationwide a large challenge of underreporting or misdiagnosis of these notifiable diseases because of lack of diagnostic laboratory capacity.
CONCLUSION: We recommend strengthening the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of VZV, measles and rubella, the surveillance and reporting of notifiable F/R diseases by retraining of healthcare workers and by setting up sentinel sites and enhancing laboratory capacity.","['Nouanthong P', 'Hübschen JM', 'Billamay S', 'Mongkhoune S', 'Vilivong K', 'Khounvisith V', 'Sinner R', 'Grandadam M', 'Phonekeo D', 'Black AP', 'Muller CP']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Nouanthong P, et al.

31064637,Disease burden of varicella versus other vaccine-preventable diseases before introduction of vaccination into the national immunisation programme in the Netherlands.,"IntroductionEstimating burden of disease (BoD) is an essential first step in the decision-making process on introducing new vaccines into national immunisation programmes (NIPs). For varicella, a common vaccine-preventable disease, BoD in the Netherlands was unknown.AimTo assess national varicella BoD and compare it to BoD of other vaccine-preventable diseases before their introduction in the NIP.MethodsIn this health estimates reporting study, BoD was expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using methodology from the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE)-project. As no parameters/disease model for varicella (including herpes zoster) were available in the BCoDE toolkit, incidence, disease progression model and parameters were derived from seroprevalence, healthcare registries and published data. For most other diseases, BoD was estimated with existing BCoDE-parameters, adapted to the Netherlands if needed.ResultsIn 2017, the estimated BoD of varicella in the Netherlands was 1,800 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1,800-1,900) DALYs. Herpes zoster mainly contributed to this BoD (1,600 DALYs; 91%), which was generally lower than the BoD of most current NIP diseases in the year before their introduction into the NIP. However, BoD for varicella was higher than for rotavirus gastroenteritis (1,100; 95%UI: 440-2,200 DALYs) and meningococcal B disease (620; 95%UI: 490-770 DALYs), two other potential NIP candidates.ConclusionsWhen considering the introduction of a new vaccine in the NIP, BoD is usually estimated in isolation. The current approach assesses BoD in relation to other vaccine-preventable diseases' BoD, which may help national advisory committees on immunisation and policymakers to set vaccination priorities.","['van Lier A', 'de Gier B', 'McDonald SA', 'Mangen MJ', 'van Wijhe M', 'Sanders EAM', 'Kretzschmar ME', 'van Vliet H', 'de Melker HE']",2019,24,18,Euro Surveill,"van Lier A, et al.

31062445,"Varicella in Tshuapa Province, Democratic Republic of Congo, 2009-2014.","OBJECTIVE: To describe varicella cases in Tshuapa Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified during monkeypox surveillance.
METHODS: Demographic, clinical and epidemiological data were collected from each suspected monkeypox case 2009-2014. Samples were tested by PCR for both Orthopoxviruses and varicella-zoster virus (VZV); a subset of VZV-positive samples was genotyped. We defined a varicella case as a rash illness with laboratory-confirmed VZV.
RESULTS: There were 366 varicella cases were identified; 66% were ≤19 years old. Most patients had non-typical varicella rash with lesions reported as the same size and stage of evolution (86%), deep and profound (91%), on palms of hands and/or soles of feet (86%) and not itchy (49%). Many had non-typical signs and symptoms, such as lymphadenopathy (70%) and sensitivity to light (23%). A higher proportion of persons aged ≥20 years than persons aged ≤19 years had ≥50 lesions (79% vs. 65%, P = 0.007) and were bedridden (15% vs. 9%, P = 0.056). All VZV isolates genotyped from 79 varicella cases were clade 5. During the surveillance period, one possible VZV-related death occurred in a 7-year-old child.
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients presented with non-typical varicella rash and clinical signs and symptoms, highlighting challenges identifying varicella in an area with endemic monkeypox. Continued surveillance and laboratory diagnosis will help in rapid identification and control of both monkeypox and varicella and improve our understanding of varicella epidemiology in Africa.","['Leung J', 'McCollum AM', 'Radford K', 'Hughes C', 'Lopez AS', 'Guagliardo SAJ', 'Nguete B', 'Likafi T', 'Kabamba J', 'Malekani J', 'Shongo Lushima R', 'Pukuta E', 'Karhemere S', 'Muyembe Tamfum JJ', 'Reynolds MG', 'Wemakoy Okitolonda E', 'Schmid DS', 'Marin M']",2019,24,7,Trop Med Int Health,"Leung J, et al.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Existing trial-based group sequential approaches have been extended to adjust for confounders, accommodate rare events, and address privacy-related constraints on data sharing. Most adaptations have involved design-based confounder strategies, for example, self-controlled or exposure matching, while analysis-based approaches like regression and weighting have received less attention. We describe the methodology of two new group sequential approaches that use analysis-based confounder adjustment (GS GEE) and weighting (GS IPTW). Using data from the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel network, we apply both methods in the context of a known positive association: the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine and seizure risk in infants.
RESULTS: Estimates from both new approaches were similar and comparable to prior studies using design-based methods to address confounding. The time to detection of a safety signal was considerably shorter for GS IPTW, which estimates a risk difference, compared to GS GEE, which provides relative estimates of excess risk.
CONCLUSION: Future group sequential safety surveillance efforts should consider analysis-based confounder adjustment techniques that evaluate safety signals on the risk difference scale to achieve greater statistical power and more timely results.","['Cook AJ', 'Wellman RD', 'Marsh T', 'Shoaibi A', 'Tiwari R', 'Nguyen M', 'Boudreau D', 'Weintraub ES', 'Jackson L', 'Nelson JC']",2019,113,,J Clin Epidemiol,"Cook AJ, et al.

31051029,Possible European Origin of Circulating Varicella Zoster Virus Strains.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of chickenpox and shingles. The geographic distribution of VZV clades was taken as evidence that VZV migrated out of Africa with human populations. We show that extant VZV strains most likely originated in Europe and not in Africa. Europe was also identified as the ancestral location for most internal nodes of the VZV phylogeny, including the ancestor of clade 5 strains. We also show that strains from clades 1, 2, 3, and 5 derived a major proportion of their ancestry from each of 4 ancestral populations. Conversely, viruses from other clades displayed variable levels of admixture. Some low-level admixture was also observed for clade 5 genomes, but only for non-African viruses. This pattern indicates that the clade 5 VZV strains do not represent recent introductions from Africa due to migratory fluxes. These data have also relevance for the definition and classification of VZV clades.","['Pontremoli C', 'Forni D', 'Clerici M', 'Cagliani R', 'Sironi M']",2020,221,8,J Infect Dis,"Pontremoli C, et al.

31041405,Vaccination coverage in healthcare workers: a multicenter cross-sectional study in Italy.,"INTRODUCTION: In recent years, a phenomenon known as ""vaccine hesitancy"" has spread throughout the world, even among health workers, determining a reduction in vaccination coverage (VC).A study aimed at evaluating VC among healthcare workers (HCWs) in 10 Italian cities (L'Aquila, Genoa, Milan, Palermo, Sassari, Catanzaro, Ferrara, Catania, Naples, Messina) was performed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Annex 3 of the Presidential Decree n. 445 of 28 December 2000 was used to collect information on the vaccination status of HCWs. The mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated with regard to the quantitative variable (age), while absolute and relative frequencies were obtained for categorical data (sex, professional profile, working sector, vaccination status). The connection between VC and the categorical variables was evaluated by chi-square method (statistical significance at p < 0.05). The statistical analyses were performed by SPSS and Stata software.
RESULTS: A total of 3,454 HCWs participated in the project: 1,236 males and 2,218 females.The sample comprised: physicians (26.9%), trainee physicians (16.1%), nurses (17.2%) and other professional categories (9.8%). Low VC was generally recorded. Higher VC was found with regard to polio, hepatitis B, tetanus and diphtheria, while coverage was very low for measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, chickenpox and influenza (20-30%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed low VC rates among HCWs for all the vaccinations. Measures to increase VC are therefore necessary in order to prevent HCWs from becoming a source of transmission of infections with high morbidity and/or mortality both within hospitals and outside.","['Genovese C', 'Picerno IAM', 'Trimarchi G', 'Cannavò G', 'Egitto G', 'Cosenza B', 'Merlina V', 'Icardi G', 'Panatto D', 'Amicizia D', 'Orsi A', 'Colosio C', 'Marsili C', 'Lari C', 'Palamara MAR', 'Vitale F', 'Casuccio A', 'Costantino C', 'Azara A', 'Castiglia P', 'Bianco A', 'Currà A', 'Gabutti G', 'Stefanati A', 'Sandri F', 'Florescu C', 'Marranzano M', 'Giorgianni G', 'Fiore V', 'Platania A', 'Torre I', 'Cappuccio A', 'Guillari A', 'Fabiani L', 'Giuliani AR', 'Appetiti A', 'Fauci V', 'Squeri A', 'Ragusa R', 'Squeri R']",2019,60,1,J Prev Med Hyg,"Genovese C, et al.

31035950,Susceptibility for varicella and factors associated with immunity among pregnant women in a tertiary care hospital in Sri Lanka- a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella during pregnancy can lead to serious maternal and fetal consequences. Although an effective vaccine is available it is not incorporated in to the routine vaccination programs in most of the Asian countries. Objectives of the study were to determine the susceptibility to varicella and factors associated with immunity, among a group of pregnant women attending to a tertiary care hospital in Sri Lanka.
METHODS: A hospital based descriptive cross sectional study was carried out at De Soyza maternity Hospital, Colombo. A sample of 385 pregnant women was selected. Data were collected through an interviewer administered questionnaire; presence of varicella IgG in blood was assessed by a validated commercial ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay.
RESULTS: The sample had a mean age of 28.5 years and majority was educated beyond General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level. We found that 34% of study population was susceptible for the infection. A past history of varicella had a 89.5% positive predictive value and 53.1% negative predictive value for varicella immunity. Varicella sero-positivity was only associated with a lower educational level and number of childhood household members more than four. There was no association of sero-positivity with age.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a significant proportion of pregnant women of the study population are varicella-susceptible. Pre-pregnancy screening and preventive strategies including vaccination should be evaluated. History of past varicella infection could be a useful screening tool to exclude patients for vaccination.","['Premathilake IP', 'Aluthbaduge P', 'Senanayake CP', 'Jayalatharachchi R', 'Gamage S', 'Jayamaha J']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Premathilake IP, et al.

The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiologic features of VSIs in patients attending a dermatology clinic in Egypt from June 2010 to May 2011. Patient's residence, occupation, housing data, and family history of similar conditions were recorded. Categorical data were recorded as frequencies and percentages and were compared by Chi square test. P value < 0.05 was significant. Diagnosis of VSIs was made in 1000/20322 (4.9%) patients. Out of the 1000 patients with VSIs, 580 (58.0%) were residents of rural areas and 420 (42.0%) were residents of urban areas (p = 0.02). Out of the 1000 patients, 489 (48.9%) were females and 511 (51.1%) were males (p = 0.25). The breakdown of 1000 patients with VSIs indicated diagnosis of viral warts in 673 (67.3%), chickenpox (CP) in 200 (20.0%), herpes simplex (HS) facialis in 50 (5.0%), herpes zoster (HZ) in 42 (4.2%), molluscum contagiosum (MC) in 27 (2.7%.0), and anogenital warts in 8 (0.8%) cases. Overcrowding (sharing a bedroom by more than 3 persons) was recorded in 652/1000 (65.2%) of the patients with VSIs [165/200 (82.5.3%) in CP, 36/50 (72%) in HS facials, 427/673 (63.4%) in viral warts, 14/27 (51.9%) in MC, and 10/42 (23.8%) in HZ]. Family history of a similar condition was positive in 329/1000 (32.9%) of the patients with VSIs [142/200 (71.0%) in CP, 177/673 (26.3%) in viral warts, 5/27 (18.5%) in MC, and 4/50 (8%) in HS facialis]. In conclusion, viral warts and CP were the commonest VSIs diagnosed in patients who attended a dermatology clinic in Egypt. Viral skin infections were more prevalent among patients who lived in rural areas and under crowded conditions.

In this study, we report the outbreak experience and response in the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital (NDUTH), Bayelsa state, where the index case and majority of suspected cases were reported.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study between September 25th and 31st December 2017, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of all suspected and confirmed cases of HMPX seen at the NDUTH and appraised the plans, activities and challenges of the hospital in response to the outbreak based on documented observations of the hospital's infection control committee (IPC). Monkeypox cases were defined using the interim national guidelines as provided by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
RESULTS: Of 38 suspected cases of HMPX, 18(47.4%) were laboratory confirmed, 3(7.9%) were probable, while 17 (18.4%) did not fit the case definition for HMPX. Majority of the confirmed/probable cases were adults (80.9%) and males (80.9%). There was concomitant chicken pox, syphilis and HIV-1 infections in two confirmed cases and a case of nosocomial infection in one healthcare worker (HCW). The hospital established a make-shift isolation ward for case management, constituted a HMPX response team and provided IPC resources. At the outset, some HCWs were reluctant to participate in the outbreak and others avoided suspected patients. Some patients and their family members experienced stigma and discrimination and there were cases of refusal of isolation. Repeated trainings and collaborative efforts by all stakeholders addressed some of these challenges and eventually led to successful containment of the outbreak.

30907721,Characterization of Fowlpox virus in chickens and bird-biting mosquitoes: a molecular approach to investigating Avipoxvirus transmission.,"Avian pox is a highly contagious avian disease, yet relatively little is known about the epidemiology and transmission of Avipoxviruses. Using a molecular approach, we report evidence for a potential link between birds and field-caught mosquitoes in the transmission of Fowlpox virus (FWPV) in Singapore. Comparison of fpv167 (P4b), fpv126 (VLTF-1), fpv175-176 (A11R-A12L) and fpv140 (H3L) gene sequences revealed close relatedness between FWPV strains obtained from cutaneous lesions of a chicken and four pools of Culex pseudovishnui, Culex spp. (vishnui group) and Coquellitidea crassipes caught in the vicinity of the study site. Chicken-derived viruses characterized during two separate infections two years later were also identical to those detected in the first event, suggesting repeated transmission of closely related FWPV strains in the locality. Since the study location is home to resident and migratory birds, we postulated that wild birds could be the source of FWPV and that bird-biting mosquitoes could act as bridging mechanical vectors. Therefore, we determined whether the FWPV-positive mosquito pools (n=4) were positive for avian DNA using a polymerase chain reaction-sequencing assay. Our findings confirmed the presence of avian host DNA in all mosquito pools, suggesting a role for Cx. pseudovishnui, Culex spp. (vishnui group) and Cq. crassipes mosquitoes in FWPV transmission. Our study exemplifies the utilization of molecular tools to understand transmission networks of pathogens affecting avian populations, which has important implications for the design of effective control measures to minimize disease burden and economic loss.","['Yeo G', 'Wang Y', 'Chong SM', 'Humaidi M', 'Lim XF', 'Mailepessov D', 'Chan S', 'How CB', 'Lin YN', 'Huangfu T', 'Fernandez CJ', 'Hapuarachchi HC', 'Yap G']",2019,100,5,J Gen Virol,"Yeo G, et al.

There was significant difference in the positive rate of VZV-IgG antibody between the populations with different doses of varicella vaccination (P<0.05), and the population with 2 doses of vaccination had the highest positive rate of VZV-IgG antibody. There was a significant difference in the concentration of VZV-IgG antibody between the populations with different medical histories (P<0.05), and the population with a past history of varicella had the highest concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the healthy population aged 1-19 years in Harbin, there is a significant difference in the level of VZV-IgG antibody between the urban and rural populations, as well as between different age groups. Varicella vaccination should be strengthened in areas with a low vaccination rate and the population aged <14 years.","['Li XK', 'Gao XL', 'Li Y', 'Xu H', 'Fan CL']",2019,21,3,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,"Li XK, et al.

OBJECTIVE: This paper is a reminder to physicians, that Herpes Zoster can still be present in children, even in the era after the development of the varicella vaccine and its introduction in the national immunization programs globally.
METHODS: We present the case of an immunocompetent 11-year old vaccinated male patient, who developed a HZ infection. The child had received two doses of the VZV vaccination (Varivax®), nine years (first dose) and six years (second dose) prior to the infection.
RESULTS: Together with the case presentation, we summarize in this report the most recent published data, concerning the HZ prevalence in healthy varicella zoster vaccinated children.
CONCLUSION: Vaccinated pediatric patients are not completely free of risk concerning HZ. Physicians, especially pediatricians and dermatologists, should be alert in order to recognize and treat HZ early, so as to avoid further complications.","['Plachouri KM', 'Gkentzi D', 'Varvarigou A', 'Georgiou S', 'Dimitriou G']",2019,15,4,Curr Pediatr Rev,"Plachouri KM, et al.

A previous study demonstrated that the vaccine effectiveness was insufficient to prevent against varicella. We assessed the effect of the varicella vaccination on disease severity.
METHODS: Epidemiologic investigation of varicella cases in Seoul metropolitan area from 2015 to 2017 were used. Varicella-related symptoms such as rash were determined by the clinical practitioners. Disease severity of patients was assessed by the number of skin lesions and divided into mild (≤ 50) and moderate (51-249) to severe (≥ 250). Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed and age was controlled.
RESULTS: Among a total of 1,008 varicella cases reported, 869 cases were breakthrough cases and 139 were unvaccinated cases. The risk for occurrence of moderate-to-severe disease in the breakthrough group was 0.57 times less than that of the unvaccinated group.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that national varicella vaccination may have a significant effect on attenuation of disease severity in children.","['Lee YH', 'Choe YJ', 'Cho SI', 'Park H', 'Bang JH', 'Lee JK']",2019,34,10,J Korean Med Sci,"Lee YH, et al.

30869552,Burden of varicella in the Asia-Pacific region: a systematic literature review.,"Varicella is a highly contagious infection that can lead to serious complications, particularly in high-risk groups; however, it is vaccine preventable. Disease awareness and understanding of the disease burden can strongly influence vaccine coverage. This review provides insight into the current epidemiology and the importance of varicella from both public health and economic perspectives across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Areas covered: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies on the incidence, seroprevalence, fatality rate and complication rate of varicella. Economic burden studies were also captured. Altogether, 125 studies were identified across the region; these were supplemented by government reports (gray data). Reported vaccine coverage varied from 2.8% to 97%; a key influencing factor was inclusion of the varicella vaccine in national immunization programs. In general, varicella incidence in the unvaccinated population was highest in children ≤5 years old and seroprevalence increased with age. Economic analyses highlighted the cost-saving potential of vaccination programs, especially from a societal perspective. Expert opinion: Varicella-related data varied greatly across the APAC region, highlighting the need to better understand the burden of varicella in this area, and particularly identified the need for better surveillance and reporting.","['Goh AEN', 'Choi EH', 'Chokephaibulkit K', 'Choudhury J', 'Kuter B', 'Lee PI', 'Marshall H', 'Kim JO', 'Wolfson LJ']",2019,18,5,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Goh AEN, et al.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical consistency, immunogenicity, and reactogenicity of three batches of MMR vaccine prepared with active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from Bio-Manguinhos, Fiocruz (MMR-Bio), and compare it to a vaccine (MMR produced by GlaxoSmithKline) with different API.
METHODS: This was a phase III, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority study of the MMR-Bio administered in infants immunised at health care units in Pará, Brazil, from February 2015 to January 2016. Antibody levels were titrated by immunoenzymatic assays. Adverse events were recorded in diaries.
FINDINGS: Seropositivity levels after MMR-Bio were 97.6% for measles, 84.7% for mumps, and 98.0% for rubella. After the MMRV vaccine, seroconversion rates and GMT increased substantially for mumps. In contrast, approximately 35% of the children had no detectable antibodies to varicella. Systemic adverse events were more frequent than local events.
CONCLUSION: The demonstration of batch consistency and non-inferiority of the Bio-MMR vaccine completed the technology transfer. This is a significant technological achievement with implications for immunisation programs.","['Santos EMD', 'Noronha TG', 'Alves IS', 'Cruz RLS', 'Ferroco CLV', 'Brum RC', 'Oliveira PMN', 'Siqueira MM', 'Lima MC', 'Ramos FLP', 'Bragagnolo CM', 'Camacho LAB', 'Maia MLS']",2019,114,,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,"Santos EMD, et al.

30810402,Burden of varicella in Central and Eastern Europe: findings from a systematic literature review.,"INTRODUCTION: Vaccination against varicella rapidly reduces disease incidence, resulting in reductions in both individual burden and societal costs. Despite these benefits, there is no standardization of varicella immunization policies in Europe, including countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).
AREAS COVERED: This systematic literature review identified publications on the epidemiology of varicella, its associated health and economic burden, and vaccination strategies within the CEE region, defined as Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Twenty-six studies were identified from a search of PubMed, Embase®, and MEDLINE® biomedical literature databases, supplemented by gray literature and country-specific/global websites.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Limited information exists in published studies on the burden of varicella in CEE. The wide variability in incidence rates between countries is likely explained by a lack of consistency in reporting systems. Funded universal varicella vaccination (UVV) in CEE is currently available only in Latvia as a one-dose schedule, but Hungary together with Latvia are introducing a two-dose strategy in 2019. For countries that do not provide UVV, introduction of vaccination is predicted to provide substantial reductions in cases and rates of associated complications, with important economic benefits.","['Mészner Z', 'Wysocki J', 'Richter D', 'Zavadska D', 'Ivaskeviciene I', 'Usonis V', 'Pokorn M', 'Mangarov A', 'Jancoriene L', 'Man SC', 'Kristufkova Z', 'Jesenak M', 'Tešović G', 'Pluta J', 'Wolfson LJ']",2019,18,3,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Mészner Z, et al.

30809999,Varicella complications in children one-site Polish population – a 19- year long survey.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of chickenpox complications in children, based on a 19-year long survey.
METHODS: This publication constitutes a review of medical records of 761 patients under the age of 18 who were hospitalized at the T. Browicz Provincial Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Bydgoszcz, Poland from the 1st of January 1999 to the 31st of December 2017.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 761 children diagnosed with varicella complications were hospitalized. The mean number of hospitalizations in each year amounted to 40. The median age of admitted patients was 4 years. The median length of hospitalization was 5 days (ranged from 1 to 30 days). The most frequent varicella complications included respiratory tract infections – 229/761 (30.1%), bacterial skin infections – 189/761 (24.8%) and gastrointestinal tract disorders – 142/761 (18.6%). Pneumonia, bronchitis and gastrointestinal tract disturbances, were reported most often in children under 2 years of age, while neurological complications occurred most frequently in children at 3-6 years of age. No significant differences in the number of varicella complications between immunocompromised and immunocompetent children were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella complications mainly affect the youngest immunocompetent children. Population-wide vaccination and herd immunity appears to be the best way to reduce the incidence of chickenpox and the rate of varicella complications.

30792698,Herpes Virus Reactivation in Astronauts During Spaceflight and Its Application on Earth.,"Latent herpes virus reactivation has been demonstrated in astronauts during shuttle (10-16 days) and International Space Station (≥180 days) flights. Following reactivation, viruses are shed in the body fluids of astronauts. Typically, shedding of viral DNA is asymptomatic in astronauts regardless of mission duration; however, in some cases, live/infectious virus was recovered by tissue culture that was associated with atopic-dermatitis or skin lesions during and after spaceflight. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes activation during spaceflight occurs as indicated by increased levels of stress hormones including cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These changes, along with a decreased cell mediated immunity, contribute to the reactivation of latent herpes viruses in astronauts. Currently, 47/89 (53%) astronauts from shuttle-flights and 14/23 (61%) astronauts from ISS missions shed one or more herpes viruses in saliva/urine samples. Astronauts shed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and herpes-simplex-1 (HSV-1) in saliva and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in urine. Larger quantities and increased frequencies for these viruses were found during spaceflight as compared to before or after flight samples and their matched healthy controls. The shedding did not abate during the longer ISS missions, but rather increased in frequency and amplitude. These findings coincided with the immune system dysregulation observed in astronauts from shuttle and ISS missions. VZV shedding increased from 41% in space shuttle to 65% in ISS missions, EBV increased 82 to 96%, and CMV increased 47 to 61%. In addition, VZV/CMV shed ≤30 days after ISS in contrast to shuttle where VZV/CMV shed up to 5 and 3 days after flight respectively. Continued shedding of infectious-virus post-flight may pose a potential risk for crew who may encounter newborn infants, sero-negative adults or any immunocompromised individuals on Earth. Therefore, developing spaceflight countermeasures to prevent viral reactivation is essential. Our spaceflight-developed technologies for saliva collection/rapid viral detection have been extended to include clinical applications including zoster patients, chicken pox, post-herpetic neuralgia, multiple sclerosis, and various neurological disorders. These protocols are employed in various clinics and hospitals including the CDC and Columbia University in New York, as well as overseas in Switzerland and Israel.","['Rooney BV', 'Crucian BE', 'Pierson DL', 'Laudenslager ML', 'Mehta SK']",2019,10,,Front Microbiol,"Rooney BV, et al.

A year-long observational study (July 2015-2016) carried out by a research network of primary care pediatricians throughout Spain.Two hundred and sixty-four pediatricians gathered data from 358 cases of clinically diagnosed chickenpox in infants. The illness was considered mild in 78% of infants < 7 months compared to 65% in those aged 7 to 12 months (p = 0.0144). Fever (46%) was present in 35% of children ≤ 6 months compared to 55% in older children (p = 0.0005). The number of skin lesions was > 50 in 35% of children ≤ 6 months old compared to 47% in > 7 months (p = 0.0273). From the 2% of hospitalized children 86% were younger than 7 months. Oral antiviral treatment was given in 33% of cases ≤ 6 months compared to 18% in older patients (p = 0.0023). Doubts about administering the chickenpox vaccine at a later date were expressed by 18% of pediatricians.Conclusion: Chickenpox is considered benign, having a mild effect on most infants. There is less clinical effect in infants ≤ 6 months although this age group is hospitalized more and is prescribed more antiviral treatment. There are doubts among pediatricians about the subsequent need for vaccination. What is Known: • Chickenpox is uncommon and of uncertain evolution in the first year of life • Hospital admissions for chickenpox are more frequent in the first year of life What is New: • The course of chickenpox in the first year of life is mild, especially in infants younger than 7 months despite the fact they are hospitalized more and are treated more frequently with antivirals. Antivirals are prescribed to 1 in 4 children with chickenpox under 12 months of age. • Almost 50% of pediatricians recommend a subsequent vaccination against chickenpox especially if it occurs in the first 6 months of life.","['Rodriguez-Santana Y', 'Sanchez-Almeida E', 'Garcia-Vera C', 'Garcia-Ventura M', 'Martinez-Espligares L', 'PAPenRED']",2019,178,5,Eur J Pediatr,"Rodriguez-Santana Y, et al.

30765242,"Protection against varicella with two doses of combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine or one dose of monovalent varicella vaccine: 10-year follow-up of a phase 3 multicentre, observer-blind, randomised, controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: The duration of protection provided by varicella vaccines is unclear. We assessed the 10-year vaccine efficacy of two doses of a combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV), one live attenuated varicella vaccine (V) dose given after one measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) dose (MMR + V), versus two MMR doses (control vaccine) for the prevention of confirmed varicella.
METHODS: This was a phase 3b follow-up of an observer-blinded, randomised, controlled trial. In phase a, children aged 12-22 months (at first vaccination) from Czech Republic (Czechia), Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Sweden were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation list (3:3:1) to receive two doses of MMRV, one dose of MMR and one dose of varicella vaccine, or two doses of MMR, 42 days apart. Varicella cases were confirmed by detection of viral DNA, or epidemiological link and clinical assessment, by an independent data monitoring committee; disease severity was based on a modified Vázquez scale. Hazard ratios for MMRV and MMR + V versus MMR estimated in the per-protocol cohort using a Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to calculate vaccine efficacy and 95% CI. Serious adverse events were recorded throughout the study in all vaccinated children. Study objectives were secondary and descriptive. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00226499.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2005, and May 10, 2006, 5803 children (mean age 14·2 months, SD 2·5) were vaccinated. The per-protocol cohort included 2279 children from the MMRV group, 2266 from the MMR + V group, and 744 from the MMR group. From baseline to a median follow-up of 9·8 years, 76 (3%) children in the MMRV group, 469 (21%) in the MMR + V group, and 352 (47%) in the MMR group had varicella. Vaccine efficacy against all varicella was 95·4% (95% CI 94·0-96·4) for MMRV and 67·2% (62·3-71·5) for MMR + V; vaccine efficacy against moderate or severe varicella was 99·1% (97·9-99·6) for MMRV and 89·5% (86·1-92·1) for MMR + V. During phase b, serious adverse events were reported by 290 (15%) of 1961 children in the MMRV group, 317 (16%) of 1978 in the MMR + V group, and 93 (15%) of 641 in the MMR group. There were no treatment-related deaths.
INTERPRETATION: The 10-years vaccine efficacy observed, suggests that a two-dose schedule of varicella vaccine provided optimum long-term protection for the prevention of varicella by offering individual protection against all severities of disease and leading to a potential reduction in transmission, as observed in the US experience with universal mass vaccination.

30732648,"Safety and immunogenicity of a varicella vaccine without human serum albumin (HSA) versus a HSA-containing formulation administered in the second year of life: a phase III, double-blind, randomized study.","BACKGROUND: A new formulation of the live-attenuated varicella vaccine Varilrix (GSK) produced without human serum albumin (HSA) was developed to minimize a theoretical risk of transmission of infectious diseases. A previous study showed that the vaccine was immunologically non-inferior to the HSA-containing vaccine and well-tolerated in toddlers; low-grade fever was numerically higher in children receiving the vaccine without HSA, but the study lacked power to conclude on this difference.
METHODS: In this phase III, double-blind, multi-center study, healthy 12-23-month-olds were randomized (1:1) to receive two doses of the varicella vaccine without (Var-HSA group) or with HSA (Var + HSA group) at days 0 and 42. The primary objective compared safety of the vaccines in terms of incidence of fever > 39.0 °C in the 15-day period post-first vaccination. The objective was considered met if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the incidence of fever > 39.0 °C was ≤5% (Var-HSA group minus Var + HSA group). Safety, reactogenicity and immune responses were evaluated.
RESULTS: Six hundred fifteen children in the Var-HSA group and 616 in the Var + HSA group received ≥1 vaccination. Fever > 39.0 °C was reported in 3.9 and 5.2% of participants in the Var-HSA and Var + HSA groups, with a between-group difference of - 1.29 (95% confidence interval: - 3.72-1.08); therefore, the primary objective was achieved. Fever rates post-each dose and the incidence of solicited local and general adverse events (AEs) were comparable between groups. Unsolicited AEs were reported for 43.9 and 36.5% of children in the Var-HSA group and 45.8 and 36.0% of children in the Var + HSA group, during 43 days post-dose 1 and 2, respectively. Serious AEs occurred in 2.1% (group Var-HSA) and 2.4% (group Var + HSA) of children, throughout the study. In a sub-cohort of 364 children, all had anti-varicella-zoster virus antibody concentrations ≥50 mIU/mL post-dose 2; comparable geometric mean concentrations were observed between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The varicella vaccine formulated without HSA did not induce higher rates of fever during the 15 day-post-vaccination period, as compared with the original HSA-containing vaccine. The two vaccines displayed similar safety and immunogenicity profiles in toddlers.

30732563,A case report of severe recurrent varicella in an ankylosing spondylitis patient treated with adalimumab - a new side effect after 15 years of usage.,"BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antagonists, most of which are monoclonal antibodies, became a widespread treatment for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis. Their use is based on the blockage of TNF-α, which plays an important role in granulomas formation, development of phagosomes, activation and differentiation of macrophages, immune response against viral pathogens. The multiple adverse effects of TNF-α inhibition have been identified, including a two-to four-fold increased risk of active tuberculosis and other granulomatous conditions and an increased occurrence of some other serious bacterial, fungal and certain viral infections.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old male patient with disseminated varicella and pneumonitis was admitted to our hospital. The diagnosis of varicella was established serologically by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and by polymerase chain reaction confirmation of the virus in vesicular fluid. The patient has been receiving adalimumab and methotrexate for the last 3 years due to ankylosing spondylitis and was seropositive to varicella zoster virus prior to the introduction of TNF-α antagonists. Acyclovir was administered for 10 days with the resolution of clinical illness and radiological signs of pneumonitis.
CONCLUSION: Due to the use of biological agents, particularly TNF-α inhibitors, as a well-established therapy for some autoimmune diseases, new potential adverse events can be expected in the future and we wanted to point out one of them. To our knowledge this is the first case of recurrent disseminated varicella in a patient taking TNF-α antagonists.","['Skuhala T', 'Atelj A', 'Prepolec J', 'Al-Mufleh M', 'Stanimirović A', 'Vukelić D']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Skuhala T, et al.

30728261,Comparison of the Whole-Genome Sequence of an Oka Varicella Vaccine from China with Other Oka Vaccine Strains Reveals Sites Putatively Critical for Vaccine Efficacy.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection results in varicella mostly in children. Reactivation of the virus causes herpes zoster (HZ), mostly in adults. A live attenuated vaccine (vOka-Biken) was originally derived from the parental strain pOka. Several live attenuated vaccines based on the Oka strain are currently available worldwide. In China, varicella vaccines have been licensed by four manufacturers. In this study, we analyze the whole-genome sequence (WGS) of vOka-BK produced by Changchun BCHT Biotechnology also known as Baike. vOka-BK WGS was compared against the genomic sequences of four other Oka strains: pOka, vOka-Biken, vOka-Varilrix from GlaxoSmithKline, and vOka-Varivax from Merck & Co. A previous study identified 137 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shared by all vOkas. The current analysis used these data as a reference to compare with vOka-BK WGS and focused on 54 SNPs located in the unique regions of the genome. Twenty-eight nonsynonymous substitutions were identified, ORF62 and ORF55 featuring the most amino acid changes with 9 and 3, respectively. Among the 54 SNPs, 10 had a different mutation profile in vOka-BK compared to the other three vaccines. A comparison with the clade 3 strain Ellen, known to be attenuated, identified three shared amino acid changes: *130R in ORF0 and R958G and S628G in ORF62. This analysis provides the first comparison of a Chinese varicella vaccine to the other vaccines available worldwide and identifies sites potentially critical for VZV vaccine efficacy.","['Wu Q', 'Rivailler P', 'Xu S', 'Xu W']",2019,93,9,J Virol,"Wu Q, et al.

30727971,The impact of childhood varicella vaccination on the incidence of herpes zoster in the general population: modelling the effect of exogenous and endogenous varicella-zoster virus immunity boosting.,"BACKGROUND: A controversy exists about the potential effect of childhood varicella vaccination on Herpes Zoster (HZ) incidence. Mathematical models projected temporary HZ incidence increase after vaccine introduction that was not confirmed by real-world evidence. These models assume that absence of contacts with infected children would prevent exogenous boosting of Varicella-Zoster-Virus (VZV) immunity and they do not include an endogenous VZV immunity-boosting mechanism following asymptomatic VZV reactivation. This study aims to explore the effect of various assumptions on exogenous and endogenous VZV immunity-boosting on HZ incidence in the general population after introduction of routine childhood varicella vaccination.
METHODS: An age-structured dynamic transmission model was adapted and fitted to the seroprevalence of varicella in France in absence of vaccination using the empirical contact matrix. A two-dose childhood varicella vaccination schedule was introduced at 12 and 18 months. Vaccine efficacy was assumed at 65%/95% (dose 1/dose 2), and coverage at 90%/80% (dose 1/dose 2). Exogenous boosting intensity was based on assumptions regarding HZ-immunity duration, age-dependent boosting effect, and HZ reactivation rates fitted to observed HZ incidence. Endogenous boosting was the same as pre-vaccination exogenous boosting but constant over time, whilst exogenous boosting depended on the force of infection. Five scenarios were tested with different weightings of exogenous (Exo) - endogenous (Endo) boosting: 100%Exo-0%Endo, 75%Exo-25%Endo, 50%Exo-50%Endo, 25%Exo-75%Endo, 0%Exo-100%Endo.
RESULTS: HZ incidence before varicella vaccination, all ages combined, was estimated at 3.96 per 1000 person-years; it decreased by 64% by year 80 post vaccine introduction, for all boosting assumptions. The 100%Exo-0%Endo boosting scenario, predicted an increase in HZ incidence for the first 21 years post vaccine introduction with a maximum increase of 3.7% (4.1/1000) at year 9. However, with 0%Exo-100%Endo boosting scenario an immediate HZ decline was projected. The maximum HZ incidence increases at 10, 3, and 2 years post vaccination were 1.8% (75%Exo-25%Endo), 0.8% (50%Exo-50%Endo) and 0.2% (25%Exo-75%Endo), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming modest levels of endogenous boosting, the increase in HZ incidence following childhood varicella vaccination was smaller and lasted for a shorter period compared with 100%Exo-0%Endo boosting assumption. Endogenous boosting mechanism could partly explain the divergence between previous HZ-incidence projections and real-world evidence.","['Sauboin C', 'Holl K', 'Bonanni P', 'Gershon AA', 'Benninghoff B', 'Carryn S', 'Burgess MA', 'Wutzler P']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Sauboin C, et al.

30704422,Reliability and accuracy of smartphones for paediatric infectious disease consultations for children with rash in the paediatric emergency department.,"OBJECTIVE: Smartphones and associated messaging applications have become the most common means of communication among health care workers and the general population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of smartphones for the diagnosis of rash in children admitted to emergency departments during the night shift.
METHODS: The images of the children who were admitted to the paediatric emergency department with rash were included in this study, and at least two images taken with smartphones by residents or paediatric infectious disease fellows were re-directed to the chief consultant of the Paediatric-Infectious Department via smartphone. Initial diagnosis by the consultant was recorded, and the patient's physical examination was performed by another clinician on the first working day; diagnostic tests were planned by this clinician. The definitive diagnosis was recorded and compared with the initial diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among the 194 patients, the most common final diagnoses were chickenpox (varicella-zoster infections) in 33 patients (17.0%) and skin infections (including impetigo, ecthyma, erysipelas and cellulitis) in 33 patients (17.0%). The initial diagnosis, which was performed via WhatsApp on a smartphone, was identical to the final diagnosis in 96.3% of the cases. Incompatible initial diagnoses included 4 measles cases, 1 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome case, 1 cutaneous leishmaniasis case and 1 petechial rash case.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that the use of a smartphone-based instant messaging application for transmitting images of paediatric rash is accurate and useful for diagnosis. However, physical examination and medical history are still the primary methods. Consultation via smartphones in emergency departments for paediatric rashes during nightshifts would help both clinicians and patients.","['Devrim İ', 'Düzgöl M', 'Kara A', 'Çağlar İ', 'Devrim F', 'Bayram N', 'Apa H']",2019,19,1,BMC Pediatr,"Devrim İ, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the immune status against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies among a group of pregnant women and to study the relationship between VZV seroprevalence and some sociodemographic characteristics.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on a group of pregnant women (
RESULTS: VZV seroprevalence was detected in 294 (88.3%) of the 333 recruited pregnant women. Older age > 25 years old was significantly associated with low percent of VZV-negative antibodies (6.7% in versus 17.4% in younger age, OR (95%CI) 0.34 (0.17-0.70)), also having more than one child was significantly associated with a low percent of VZV-negative antibodies (8.2% versus 16.1% among participants with no children or having one child, OR 0.34 (0.17-0.70)).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of a routine VZV vaccination program in Egypt, VZV immunity was high among pregnant women, but less than that reported in many developed countries. We recommend targeted vaccination for women in the reproductive age especially young and primipara.

30681397,Varicella healthcare resource utilization in middle income countries: a pooled analysis of the multi-country MARVEL study in Latin America & Europe.,"Varicella is a mild and self-limited illness in children, but can result in significant healthcare resource utilization (HCRU). To quantify/contrast varicella-associated HCRU in five middle-income countries (Hungary, Poland, Argentina, Mexico, and Peru) where universal varicella vaccination was unimplemented, charts were retrospectively reviewed among 1-14 year-olds. Data were obtained on management of primary varicella between 2009-2016, including outpatient/inpatient visits, allied healthcare contacts, tests/procedures, and medications. These results are contrasted across countries, and a regression model is fit to extrapolated country-level costs as a function of gross domestic product (GDP).

30652441,Clinical and epidemiological impact of varicella infection in children prior to the introduction of the varicella vaccine in the national immunization schedule of Argentina.,"INTRODUCTION: In Argentina, an estimated 400 000 varicella cases occur annually. Given the under-recording of existing cases, the actual burden of disease is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden of varicella before the introduction of the varicella vaccine in the national immunization schedule.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, analytical, observational study carried out in three hospitals of Argentina. Review of medical records from outpatient visits to the Emergency Department and from patients younger than 18 years hospitalized for varicella. Period: 1/2011-12/2013.
RESULTS: A total of 382 782 outpatients were seen; 3367(0.88%) corresponded to visits due to varicella; 57.6 % were < 4 years old. A total of 164 (4.9 %) patients required hospitalization, with an overall hospitalization rate of 65.3/10 000 hospitalized patients/year (95 % confidence interval |#91;CI|#93;: 55.4-76.5); hospitalization rate in healthy children: 57.2/10 000 (95 % CI: 67.7-48.0); median age: 31.5 months. The most common causes of hospitalization were skin and/or soft tissue infections (61.1 %) and respiratory infections (10.1 %). Also, 54.3 % were treated with acyclovir and 73.1 %, with antibiotics. Bacteremia developed in 5/67 patients (7.5 %), all cases were caused by Gram-positive cocci and occurred in immunocompetent patients. Out of 19 immunocompromised patients, 36.8 % had complications (5 skin and/or soft tissue infection and 2 pneumonia cases). The median length of stay was 4 days, which is significantly more prolonged in immunocompromised patients. One patient required intensive care. No patient died.
CONCLUSION: The burden of disease was significant, with a considerable impact in patients without an underlying disease.","['Neyro SE', 'Ferolla FM', 'Molise C', 'Stach P', 'Romano P', 'Marone S', 'de Mena A', 'Plat F', 'Voto C', 'Soto P', 'Bustos L', 'Clavijo C', 'Murgo D', 'Dozoretz D', 'Fiorentino J', 'Lopez EL']",2019,117,1,Arch Argent Pediatr,"Neyro SE, et al.

30652233,Models for optimally controlling varicella and herpes zoster by varicella vaccination: a comparative study.,"The introduction of mass vaccination against Varicella-Zoster-Virus (VZV) is being delayed in many European countries mainly because of the ""fear"" of a subsequent boom in natural herpes zoster (HZ) incidence in the first decades after the initiation of vaccination, caused by the expected decline in the protective effect of natural immunity boosting due to reduced virus circulation. Optimal control theory has proven to be a successful tool in understanding ways to curtail the spread of infectious diseases by devising the optimal disease intervention strategies. In this paper, we describe how a reduced 'toy' model can extract the essentials of the dynamics of the VZV transmission and reactivation in case of the study of optimal paths of varicella immunization programs. Results obtained using different optimization approaches are compared with the ones of a more realistic age-structured model. The reduced model shows some unreliable predictions in regards of model time scales about herpes zoster dynamic; nevertheless, it is able to reproduce the main qualitative dynamic of the more realistic model to the different optimization problems, while requiring a minimal number of parameters to be identified.

30648073,An Uncommon Cause of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Related to Antibiotic Ingestion.,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurotoxic state manifested with a unique computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance. PRES is associated with different conditions, such as eclampsia, sepsis, organ transplantation, and drugs, especially immunosuppressive medications. Besides pharmacologic side effects, antibiotics can cause PRES as well. Here, we report a 37-year-old female from Saudi Arabia, presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a two-day history of fluctuations in consciousness level, headache, and blurring of vision. A generalized vesicular skin rash preceded the condition for one month; this was diagnosed as chicken pox and the patient received co-amoxiclav for a possible superadded bacterial infection. Besides clinical manifestations, the patient had radiological abnormalities, which were resolved following the withdrawal of causative antibiotics. Ascertaining the exact etiological cause of PRES is essential for diagnosing this reversible condition as these patients undergo a complete neurological recovery if the underlying cause is identified early.","['El-Sheikh S', 'Memon M', 'Mujtaba A', 'Heena H']",2018,10,11,Cureus,"El-Sheikh S, et al.

30644703,Induction of Immune Response and Protective Immunity by a Local Isolated Varicella Virus in Animal Model: A Future Candidates for Vaccine Production.,"Preparation of the indigenous varicella zoster vaccine could significantly reduce the disease burden of varicella zoster virus especially in immunosuppressed children. To achieve this goal, the varicella zoster virus was isolated from an 8 years boy infected with chicken pox. The virus was cultivated in sensitive cell line and determined varicella zoster. The adaptation and attenuation of virus was carried out after several passages in MRC-5 cell culture, Primary Guinea pig embryo fibroblast cell culture and again switching in MRC-5 cell culture. The challenged of vaccine dose was found 3LogCCID50. Following two doses of immunization in guinea pigs via inoculated cell culture-fluid attenuated- local isolated VZV at zero and 14 day, the humoral immune response, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) IgG and IgM were determined using enzyme-linked Immunosorbent and seroneutralization assays at 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, 90.120 days after receiving of the first and second dose of vaccine.

30640536,"Long-term protection against a virulent field isolate of infectious laryngotracheitis virus induced by inactivated, recombinant, and modified live virus vaccines in commercial layers.","Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute respiratory disease of chickens controlled through vaccination with live-modified attenuated vaccines, the chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines and the tissue-culture origin (TCO) vaccines. Recently, novel recombinant vaccines have been developed using herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) and fowl pox virus (FPV) as vectors to express ILTV immunogens for protection against ILT. The objective of this study was to assess the protection efficacy against ILT induced by recombinants, live-modified attenuated, and inactivated virus vaccines when administered alone or in combination. Commercial layer pullets were vaccinated with one or more vaccines and challenged at 35 (35 WCH) or 74 weeks of age (74 WCH). Protection was assessed by scoring clinical signs; and by determining the challenge viral load in the trachea at five days post-challenge. The FPV-LT vaccinated birds were not protected when challenged at 35 weeks; the HVT-LT and TCO vaccines in combination provided protection similar to that observed in chickens vaccinated with either HVT-LT or TCO vaccines when challenged at 35 weeks, whereas protection induced by vaccination with HVT-LT followed by TCO was superior in the 74 WCH group compared with the 35 WCH group. Birds given the inactivated ILT vaccine had fewer clinical signs and/or lower viral replication at 74 WCH when combined with TCO or HVT-LT, but not when given alone. Finally, the CEO-vaccinated birds had top protection as indicated by reduction of clinical signs and viral replication when challenged at 35 weeks (74 weeks not done). These results suggest that certain vaccine combinations may be successful to produce long-term protection up to 74 weeks of age against ILT.","['Palomino-Tapia VA', 'Zavala G', 'Cheng S', 'García M']",2019,48,3,Avian Pathol,"Palomino-Tapia VA, et al.

30628536,Severe Herpes Zoster Following Varicella Vaccination in Immunocompetent Young Children.,"Varicella vaccination is now virtually universal in North America, as well as in some European and Asian countries. Since varicella vaccine is a live attenuated virus, the virus replicates in the skin after administration and can travel via sensory nerves or viremia to become latent in the dorsal root ganglia. In some immunized children, virus reactivates within a few months to a few years to cause the dermatomal exanthem known as herpes zoster (shingles). Herpes zoster caused by vaccine virus often reactivates within the same dermatome as the site of the original varicella vaccine injection. We present evidence that occasional cases of herpes zoster following varicella vaccination in immunocompetent children can be as severe as herpes zoster following wild-type varicella. Analysis of the virus in one case disclosed that the vaccine virus causing herpes zoster was a wild-type variant with a mutation in ORF0. With regard to dermatomal localization of the viral eruption, we predict that herpes zoster of the lumbar dermatomes in children is likely to be caused by vaccine virus, because herpes zoster in those dermatomes is rare in children after wild-type varicella. One of the children with herpes zoster subsequently developed asthma, a known risk factor for herpes zoster, but none of the children had an autoimmune disease. Although postherpetic neuralgia is exceedingly rare, children who develop herpes zoster following varicella vaccination are at risk (albeit low) of developing meningoencephalitis and should be carefully observed for a few weeks.","['Moodley A', 'Swanson J', 'Grose C', 'Bonthius DJ']",2019,34,4,J Child Neurol,"Moodley A, et al.

30619226,Varicella Virus-Host Interactions During Latency and Reactivation: Lessons From Simian Varicella Virus.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus and the causative agent of varicella (chickenpox) in humans. Following primary infection, VZV establishes latency in the sensory ganglia and can reactivate to cause herpes zoster, more commonly known as shingles, which causes significant morbidity, and on rare occasions mortality, in the elderly. Because VZV infection is highly restricted to humans, the development of a reliable animal model has been challenging, and our understanding of VZV pathogenesis remains incomplete. As an alternative, infection of rhesus macaques with the homologous simian varicella virus (SVV) recapitulates the hallmarks of VZV infection and thus constitutes a robust animal model to provide critical insights into VZV pathogenesis and the host antiviral response. In this model, SVV infection results in the development of varicella during primary infection, generation of an adaptive immune response, establishment of latency in the sensory ganglia, and viral reactivation upon immune suppression. In this review, we discuss our current knowledge about host and viral factors involved in the establishment of SVV latency and reactivation as well as the important role played by T cells in SVV pathogenesis and antiviral immunity.","['Sorel O', 'Messaoudi I']",2018,9,,Front Microbiol,Sorel O and Messaoudi I.

30616954,Trends in U.S. Community hospitalizations due to herpes zoster: 2001-2015.,"BACKGROUND: In 2007, based on decisions by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the CDC recommended a booster dose at 4-6 years in the varicella vaccine schedule. In 2008, a herpes zoster vaccine was recommended for use in persons age ≥60 years. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in herpes zoster hospitalization rates and assess the impact of both policy recommendations using U.S. hospital discharge data.
METHODS: Nationwide Inpatient Sample discharge data from 2001 to 2015 were used to identify primary or secondary herpes zoster diagnoses. Trends in annual total and age-specific herpes zoster hospitalization rates and average length of stay were examined. Average annual rates for the pre (2001-2005) and post (2012-2015)-zoster vaccine policy eras were compared. Absolute change in herpes zoster hospitalizations were calculated.
RESULTS: The rate difference of U.S. herpes zoster hospitalizations in the post vs. pre-zoster vaccine policy era was -1.9 per 100,000 population (6,200 fewer hospitalizations in 2015 than expected). Key age group rate differences: 0-3 years (-0.4 per 100,000; 50 fewer), 4-6 years (-0.6 per 100,000; 50 fewer), 7-14 years (-1.3 per 100,000; 400 fewer), 50-59 years (0.7 per 100,000; 300 more), 60-69 years (-2.5 per 100,000; 900 fewer), 70-79 years (-10.2 per 100,000; 2,000 fewer), 80+ years (-29.9 per 100,000; 3,600 fewer).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of wild-type varicella due to the 2-dose varicella vaccination recommendation may have impacted declining herpes zoster hospitalization rates among children ≤14 years. The 2008 herpes zoster vaccine may have impacted declining herpes zoster hospitalization rates for adults age ≥60 years despite vaccination coverage <31% by 2015.","['Pham MA', 'Bednarczyk RA', 'Becker ER', 'Orenstein WA', 'Omer SB']",2019,37,6,Vaccine,"Pham MA, et al.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in China in which healthy children were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive one dose of varicella vaccine or placebo. The efficacy monitoring period was 6 to 7 months for each subject. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of laboratory-confirmed varicella. Efficacy and immunity were assessed in the per-protocol cohort, and safety was assessed in the total vaccinated cohort. The file was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02981836).
RESULTS: Between 22 August 2016 and 19 September 2016, a total of 5997 children (2997 in the varicella vaccine group and 3000 in the placebo group) were vaccinated, and 5991 children (2995 in the varicella vaccine group and 2996 in the placebo group) were included in the per-protocol efficacy cohort. The efficacy of the vaccine was 87.1% (95% confidence interval, 69.7-94.5) against varicella (six cases vs. 46 cases) and 89.2% (95% confidence interval, 72.9-95.7) breakthrough varicella (five cases vs. 46 cases). No significant difference in solicited adverse reactions was found between the two groups. Serious advent events occurred among 0.8% (25/2998) children in the vaccine group and 0.7% (22/2999) in the placebo group.

32237690,Chickenpox in Poland in 2017.,"BACKGROUND: Chickenpox is a common disease in Poland, which is usually mild, but can lead to serious complications. Vaccination is an effective form of prevention. Before the introduction of universal vaccination against chickenpox, high incidence was recorded in many countries. In Poland, since 2003, vaccinations are recommended for people who did not get sick, and since 2009, compulsory for children up to 12 years of age particularly exposed to infection and children from their surroundings.
AIM: To assess epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2017, including vaccination coverage in Polish population, in comparison to previous years.
METHODS: Assessment of the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2017. was based on the results of the analysis of aggregate data published in the annual bulletins: “Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2017” and “Protective Vaccination in Poland in 2017. In addition, the recommendations from the Protective Vaccine Program for 2017 were used.
RESULTS: In 2017, 173 196 cases of chickenpox were registered in Poland, 7.21% more than in the previous year. The incidence of varicella in 2017 was 450.8 per 100,000. and was higher than in 2016 . The lowest incidence was registered in the Dolnośląskie voivodeship – 324.6/ 100,000, the highest in the Opolskie voivodeship – 601.0 / 100,000. The most incidence was observed among children aged 0-4 years (88 711). Incidence in men was higher than in women, and the rural population higher than for urban residents. In 2017, 1200 people were hospitalized due to chickenpox. 75 040 people were vaccinated against varicella.
UNLABELLED: SUMMARY. In 2017, there was a slight increase in the number of smallpox cases compared to the previous year, however, the incidence remains lower than in 2012-2014. An effective method of preventing it is chickenpox vaccination, which despite the lack of universal funding is being carried out in ever greater population. Further improvement of the epidemiological situation requires public health education in the field of primary prevention based on vaccination. As recommended, the smallpox vaccination course includes two doses of the vaccine at least 6 weeks apart from the previous dose.","['Bogusz J', 'Paradowska-Stankiewicz I']",2019,73,4,Przegl Epidemiol,Bogusz J and Paradowska-Stankiewicz I.

32168443,"[Rapid immunochemical method for the detection of orthopoxviruses (Orthopoxvirus, Chordopoxvirinae, Poxviridae).].","INTRODUCTION: The abolition of smallpox vaccination has led to the disappearance of population immunity to pox viruses. However, the threat of infection by pathogenic orthopoxviruses persists and determines the need to develop sensitive and operational methods for indicating pathogens.
OBJECTIVES: Development of a sensitive, fast and easy-to-use immunochemical test for the detection of orthopoxviruses in the «point of care» format.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used preparations of cultural vaccinia virus (VV) with varying degrees of purification, polyclonal antibodies from hyperimmune rabbit serum, and equipment from a previously developed autonomous kit for dot-immunoassay on flat protein arrays.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: It has been established that rabbit polyclonal antibodies can be used in a single-stage dotanalysis, both as a capture agent immobilized on a substrate and as a detection reagent bound with colloidal gold particles. It is shown that the effectiveness of the detection of VV is inversely related to the degree of purification of viruses from sub-viral structures. The sensitivity of the rapid detection of viruses in a crude preparation was about 30 times higher than in pure viral material. The increase in sensitivity, presumably, occurs due to binding to the capture antibodies of subviral structures, which form large aggregates of sensitized gold particles. The test does not detect cross-reactions with heterogeneous viruses (measles, rubella and chickenpox) that cause exantematous diseases.
CONCLUSION: The one-stage variant of the dot-immunoassay reduces the analysis time to 40 minutes and improves the detection sensitivity of orthopoxviruses in crude viral preparations to the range of 10","['Poltavchenko AG', 'Ersh AV', 'Taranov OS', 'Yakubitskiy SN', 'Filatov PV']",2019,64,6,Vopr Virusol,"Poltavchenko AG, et al.

30590491,"Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Chickenpox Vaccination and Risk of Herpes Zoster: A Quantitative View on the ""Exogenous Boosting Hypothesis"".","BACKGROUND: The ""exogenous boosting hypothesis"" postulates that reexposure to circulating varicella zoster virus (VZV) over the life span inhibits reactivation of VZV. Consequently, if circulation of VZV is suppressed by introduction of chickenpox vaccination, incidences of herpes zoster may rise.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis on impact of chickenpox vaccination on herpes zoster incidence and time trend, focusing on population-level effects by analyzing interrupted time-series (ITS) studies. We searched Medline and Embase for ITS reporting incidences of chickenpox and herpes zoster before and after implementation of chickenpox vaccination. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were calculated. Change in trend and incidence from studies were pooled.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included, of which 6 were eligible for metaanalysis. Metaanalysis revealed a significant increase in chickenpox cases prior to implementation of chickenpox vaccination and a reversed trend thereafter, particularly in individuals aged 1-4 years. The increase in age-adjusted herpes zoster incidence before implementation of chickenpox vaccination did not change thereafter. However, separate analysis of age groups revealed a net increase of hospitalized herpes zoster cases in individuals aged 10-49 years after implementation of chickenpox vaccination. This very small effect (fewer than 2 additional cases per 100 000 persons) did not occur in other age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: To date, no conclusive evidence exists that chickenpox vaccination has a substantial population-level impact on herpes zoster in nonvaccinated age groups. While exogenous boosting may exist, the effect size generated by chickenpox vaccination might be rather small on the population level.","['Harder T', 'Siedler A']",2019,69,8,Clin Infect Dis,"Harder T and Siedler A.

30528868,Varicella vaccine effectiveness over 10 years in Australia; moderate protection from 1-dose program.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of Australia's single dose infant varicella vaccination program, we assessed single dose varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing hospitalised disease using two methods.
METHODS: Clinically confirmed varicella cases from the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) sentinel network were age-matched to 20 controls obtained from the Australian Immunisation Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate VE and compared with estimates obtained using our second approach.
RESULTS: There were 78 hospitalised varicella cases during the post vaccine introduction period from January 2008 to December 2015, who were eligible for funded varicella vaccination. Median age at onset was 4.5 years and more than half (59%) were vaccinated. The majority of children received one vaccine brand (Varilrix, GSK). The estimated case-control VE for one dose of vaccine against hospitalised varicella was 64.7% (95% CI: 43.3-78.0%); estimates using the screening method were not significantly different. Exclusion of children who were immunocompromised did not significantly alter VE estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Although Australia's program has impacted on the burden of varicella disease, single dose VE against varicella hospitalisation is only moderate. Greater reductions in varicella disease could potentially be achieved by incorporation of a second vaccine dose into the program to minimise breakthrough disease and interrupt virus circulation.","['Quinn HE', 'Gidding HF', 'Marshall HS', 'Booy R', 'Elliott EJ', 'Richmond P', 'Crawford N', 'McIntyre PB', 'Macartney KK', 'PAEDS (Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance) Network']",2019,78,3,J Infect,"Quinn HE, et al.

30505776,A Clinico-epidemiological Study of Childhood Herpes Zoster.,"Herpes zoster (HZ) is a viral infection believed to be caused by the re activation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) or human herpes virus type 3 (HHV 3) that persists in the posterior nerve root ganglion. HZ is rarely reported in the pediatric age group with an intact immunity. Past infection with VZV and immunization with chickenpox vaccine are key markers in the onset of varicella zoster in children. Our aim was to study the clinicoepidemiological pattern of HZ infection in children aged less than 12 years and to start an early management to prevent long term complications. A prospective observational study over a total duration of 2 years was conducted in a tertiary hospital, and all children less than 12 years of age with diagnosed HZ were included in the study. A total of 39 children were diagnosed to have pediatric HZ infection during the study period. The children were followed up over 4 weeks post diagnosis and were treated with oral acyclovir therapy along with symptomatic management. All children had an uneventful benign course, and their siblings and close pediatric contacts were also screened for the development of HZ or chickenpox during the incubation period. All children were screened for an underlying immunodeficiency and two cases of HIV co infection were detected. HZ is a rare disease in childhood. Varicella in early childhood is a risk factor for HZ in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent children. The appearance of HZ in a young child does not always imply an underlying immunodeficiency or malignancy, but the children should be screened for immunodeficiency. In general, the prognosis is good in healthy children.","['Mitra B', 'Chopra A', 'Talukdar K', 'Saraswat N', 'Mitra D', 'Das J']",2018,9,6,Indian Dermatol Online J,"Mitra B, et al.

30511524,[Economic evaluation of different chickenpox vaccination strategies].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost/benefit of different vaccination strategies related to chickenpox vaccine.
METHODS: The direct economic cost and indirect economic cost caused by chickenpox were obtained through questionnaire survey. The epidemic characteristics of chickenpox in Zhejiang province were studied by literature review. Dynamic model was set up by Matlab software based on the parameters of chickenpox, to predict the incidence trends of chickenpox with different immunization strategies (no vaccination, 1-dose vaccination, 2-dose vaccination) in future 40 years (2017-2056). A cost-benefit analysis was conducted, and the sensitivities of the main parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: Through the questionnaire survey of 105 cases, the direct and indirect economic cost per case was 506.84 Yuan and 1045.39 Yuan respectively, with the total of 1552.23 Yuan. During the prediction period (40 years), there would be 7.0908 million cases in strategy 2, which was 59.71% less than strategy 1 (17.5989 million cases). Total vaccination costs in strategy 2 were 2.366 billion Yuan, with a total economic gain of 33.741 billion Yuan and benefit/cost ratio (BCR) of 14.26:1. If strategy 3 was adopted, 2.7249 million chickenpox cases would occur, with a decrease of 84.52% compared with strategy 1. Total vaccination costs in strategy 3 was 4.495 billion Yuan, with a total economic gain of 44.309 billion Yuan and BCR of 9.86:1. Analysis showed that the vaccine price was the most sensitive variable, followed by the incidence of chickenpox in the absence of vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: In Zhejiang province, one-dose strategy and two-dose strategy were both cost effective. It is suggested that the chickenpox vaccination should be included in the immunization program in Zhejiang province.","['Deng X', 'He H', 'Zhou Y', 'Pan J', 'Yan R', 'Tang X', 'Fu J']",2018,47,4,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,"Deng X, et al.

The 2-dose regimen of MMRV administered IM was shown to be as immunogenic as the 2-dose regimen administered SC for all antigens 6 weeks post-vaccination for the subjects who were initially seronegative for measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella (lower bounds of the two-sided 95% CIs for the difference in response rates for all antigens greater than -10% [range -2.1 for varicella to -3.0 for mumps]). The antibody response rates for all vaccine antigens 6 weeks after the second dose of MMRV were > 99% in both the IM and SC groups. Fewer subjects in the IM group experienced injection-site AEs compared with the SC group (17.8% and 28.6% post-dose 1, and 20.4% and 29.5% post-dose 2, respectively). From Day 0 to Day 4 post-dose 2, fewer subjects reported erythema and swelling in the IM group than in the SC group (15.4% and 27.0%, and 6.0% and 12.5%, respectively). In both groups, most injection-site AEs started during the first four days after vaccination; their intensity was mainly mild or ≤2.5 cm. The rates of fever were comparable between the two groups after each dose of MMRV.

30478005,Similar relative risks of seizures following measles containing vaccination in children born preterm compared to full-term without previous seizures or seizure-related disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Febrile seizures are associated with the first dose of measles-containing vaccines and the risk increases with chronologic age during the second year of life. We used the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to determine if the relative increase in risk of seizures following receipt of measles-containing vaccine differs by gestational age at birth.
METHODS: Children were eligible if they received their first dose of measles-containing vaccine at age 12 through 23 months from January 2003 through September 2015. Children were excluded if they had a history of seizure or conditions strongly related to seizure prior to 12 months of age. Seizures were identified by diagnostic codes in the inpatient or emergency department settings. Using risk-interval analysis, we estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for seizures in the 7 through 10 days (risk period) vs 15 through 42 days (control period) following receipt of measles-containing vaccines in children born preterm (<37 weeks gestation age) and those born full-term (≥37 weeks).
RESULTS: There were 532,375 children (45,343 preterm and 487,032 full-term) who received their first dose of measles-containing vaccine at age 12 through 23 months. The IRRs of febrile seizures 7 through 10 days compared with 15 through 42 days after receipt of measles-containing vaccine were 3.9 (95% CI: 2.5-6.0) in preterm children and 3.2 (2.7-3.7) in full-term children; the ratio of IRRs: was 1.2 (0.76-1.9), p = 0.41. IRRs were also similar across gestational age groups, by vaccine type received (measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella [MMRV]) and age at vaccination (12-15 or 16-23 months).
CONCLUSION: Vaccination with a measles-containing vaccine in the second year of life is associated with a similar relative risk of a first seizure in children born preterm as in those who were born full-term.","['McClure DL', 'Jacobsen SJ', 'Klein NP', 'Naleway AL', 'Kharbanda EO', 'Glanz JM', 'Jackson LA', 'Weintraub ES', 'McLean HQ']",2019,37,1,Vaccine,"McClure DL, et al.

Every morning, this system estimates the numbers of patients from the numbers of prescriptions filled nationwide for neuraminidase inhibitors, anti-herpes virus drugs, antibiotic drugs, antipyretic analgesics, and multi-ingredient cold medications. Moreover, it can detect ""unexplained"" infectious diseases that are not explained as infectious diseases monitored by other surveillance systems. Such ""unexplained"" infectious diseases might be emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases including bioterrorism attacks, which are reportedly difficult to diagnose, at least in early outbreak stages.

30472425,Effectiveness of second-dose varicella vaccination as post-exposure prophylaxis: a prospective cohort study.,"Objectives: Although administration of a second dose of varicella vaccine (2nd-dose VarV) to individuals who have previously received one-dose VarV has been recommended as a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy for outbreak control, the effectiveness of this strategy remains unclear. We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 2nd-dose VarV as PEP among students involved in 129 varicella outbreaks in Shanghai, China from 2013 to 2016.

Methods: Students who had received one-dose VarV more than 5 years prior to varicella exposure were eligible to receive 2nd-dose VarV as PEP. We evaluated the VE using the following formula: VE = (1 - hazard ratio (HR)) × 100%.

Results: A total of 6762 students were eligible for 2nd-dose VarV, of whom 58.6% accepted PEP after varicella exposure. The adjusted VE of 2nd-dose VarV as PEP was 77% (95% confidence interval 64-85%). In addition, the adjusted VE of 2nd-dose VarV as PEP in affected classrooms with high vaccine uptake was higher than that in classrooms with lower vaccine uptake (87% vs. 69%). The adjusted VE was also higher in students who received 2nd-dose VarV within 3 days of exposure than those who received it more than 3 days post exposure (77% vs. 64%).

Conclusions: These Results suggest that administration of 2nd-dose VarV as PEP is an appropriate intervention for outbreak control in countries where two-dose VarV has not been adopted.","['Wu Q', 'Liu J', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou Q', 'Wang X', 'Xuan Z', 'Zhang L', 'Gao Y', 'Chen B', 'Hu Y']",2019,25,7,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Wu Q, et al.

A previously healthy 16-year-old boy presented with generalized rash, fever, severe abdominal pain, and abnormal liver function within 4 d. Chickenpox was suspected, and acyclovir and intravenous immunoglobulin were started on admission. However, the patient's condition deteriorated overnight with soaring transaminases, severe coagulopathy and encephalopathy. On the fourth day of admission, pancytopenia emerged, accompanied by hypofibrinogenemia and hyperferritinemia. The patient was diagnosed with ALF. He also met the diagnostic criteria of HLH according to the HLH-2004 guideline. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) were positive, confirming that VZV was a causative trigger for ALF and HLH. In view of the devastating immune activation in HLH, immunosuppression therapy with dexamethasone and etoposide was administered, in addition to high dose acyclovir. The patient's symptoms improved dramatically and he finally made a full recovery. To our knowledge, this is only the second report of a successful rescue of ALF associated with HLH, without resorting to liver transplantation. The first case was reported in a neonate infected by herpes simplex virus-1. However, survival data in older children and adults are lacking, most of whom died or underwent liver transplantation. Our report emphasizes the clinical vigilance for the possible presence of HLH, and the necessity of extensive investigation for underlying etiologies in patients presenting with indeterminate ALF. Early initiation of specific therapy targeting the underlying etiology, and watchful immunosuppression such as dexamethasone and etoposide, together with supportive therapy, are of crucial importance in this life-threatening disorder.","['Zhang LN', 'Guo W', 'Zhu JH', 'Guo Y']",2018,6,13,World J Clin Cases,"Zhang LN, et al.

In 1998, the World Health Organization recommended varicella vaccination for countries where the disease has a significant public health burden. Nonetheless, concerns about a shift in the disease to older groups, an increase in herpes zoster in the elderly and cost-effectiveness led many countries to postpone universal varicella vaccine introduction. In this review, we summarize the accumulating evidence, available mostly from high and middle-income countries supporting a high impact of universal vaccination in reductions of the incidence of the disease and hospitalizations and its cost-effectiveness.

Before the implementation of universal varicella vaccination (UVV) in some European countries, the burden of varicella disease was broadly similar across the region. Despite this, countries adopted heterogeneous varicella vaccination strategies. UVV is currently recommended in 12 European countries. Known barriers to UVV implementation in Europe include (1) a perceived low disease burden and low public health priority; (2) cost-effectiveness and funding availability; (3) concerns related to a shift in varicella disease and incidence of herpes zoster and (4) safety concerns related to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella-associated febrile seizures after the first dose. Countries that implemented UVV experienced decreases in varicella incidence, hospitalizations and complications, showing overall beneficial impact. Alternative strategies targeting susceptible individuals at higher risk of complications have been less effective.

Decades later, the virus may reactivate either spontaneously or after a number of triggering factors to cause herpes zoster (shingles). Varicella and its complications are more severe in the immunosuppressed. The most frequent and important complication of VZV reactivation is postherpetic neuralgia, the cause of which is unknown and for which treatment is usually ineffective. Reactivation of VZV may also cause a wide variety of neurological syndromes, the most significant of which is a vasculitis, which is treated with corticosteroids and the antiviral drug acyclovir. Other VZV reactivation complications include an encephalitis, segmental motor weakness and myelopathy, cranial neuropathies, Guillain⁻Barré syndrome, enteric features, and zoster sine herpete, in which the viral reactivation occurs in the absence of the characteristic dermatomally distributed vesicular rash of herpes zoster. There has also been a recent association of VZV with giant cell arteritis and this interesting finding needs further corroboration. Vaccination is now available for the prevention of both varicella in children and herpes zoster in older individuals.","['Kennedy PGE', 'Gershon AA']",2018,10,11,Viruses,Kennedy PGE and Gershon AA.

On average, there is an increase in incidence every 4 years. Therefore, it is justified to use preventive vaccination that effectively protects against infection. In Poland, since 2002, these are recommended vaccinations.
AIM: To assess the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2016. and a comparison with the situation in previous years.
METHODS: Assessment of the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2016. was based on the results of the analysis of aggregate data published in the annual bulletins: “Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2016” and “Protective Vaccination in Poland in 2016.

Children aged 0-4 (77 258) and 5-9 (60,818) became ill most. The incidence of men pox was higher than for women, and the rural population higher than for urban residents. Hospitalization due to chickenpox in 2016 included 1 219 people, which accounted for 0.76% of the total number of registered cases. 66,357 people were vaccinated against varicella.
SUMMARY: In 2016, there was a decrease in the number of smallpox cases, which may be explained by activities in the field of health education aimed at protective vaccination and indicating the benefits of preventive vaccination, as well as increasing the knowledge of the general public in the prevention of infectious diseases by vaccination.","['Królasik A', 'Paradowska-Stankiewicz I']",2018,72,3,Przegl Epidemiol,Królasik A and Paradowska-Stankiewicz I.

30354696,Understanding the role of exogenous boosting in modeling varicella vaccination.,"INTRODUCTION: The exogenous boosting (EB) hypothesis posits that cell-mediated immunity is boosted for individuals reexposed to varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Historically, mathematical models of the impact of universal childhood varicella vaccination (UVV) have used limited data to capture EB and often conclude that UVV will temporarily increase herpes zoster (HZ) incidence.
AREAS COVERED: We updated a 2013 systematic literature review of 40 studies to summarize new evidence from observational or modeling studies related to EB and its parameterization. We abstracted data on observational study designs and mathematical model structures, EB frameworks, and HZ-related parameter values.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: This review identified an additional 41 studies: 22 observational and 19 modeling studies. Observational analyses generally reported pre-UVV increases in HZ incidence, making it difficult to attribute post-UVV increases to UVV versus other causes. Modeling studies considered a range of EB frameworks, from no boosting to full permanent immunity. Mathematical modeling efforts are needed in countries with long-standing vaccination programs to capture the dynamics of VZV transmission and temporal changes that may affect HZ incidence. Use of real-world pre-/postvaccination data on varicella and HZ incidence to validate model predictions may improve approaches to EB parameterization and understanding of the effects of varicella vaccination programs.","['Talbird SE', 'La EM', 'Mauskopf J', 'Altland A', 'Daniels V', 'Wolfson LJ']",2018,17,11,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Talbird SE, et al.

30309745,Herpes zoster in the context of varicella vaccination - An equation with several variables.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella and herpes zoster (HZ), diseases both caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), are vaccine-preventable. However, the hypothesis that childhood varicella vaccination may increase the incidence of HZ hinders varicella universal routine vaccination (URV) implementation in many countries.
METHODS: This non-systematic and narrative review of the literature considers the burden of varicella and HZ, and the effectiveness of the respective vaccines. We present the factors involved in the interplay between varicella vaccination and HZ incidence, including the roles of exogenous and endogenous boosting. We review HZ incidence model predictions, and compare these with real-world evidence, which has accumulated since varicella URV was introduced.
CONCLUSION: Although more research and longer surveillance are needed, available real-world evidence has not confirmed the model-predicted increase in HZ incidence, associated with childhood varicella URV. Although there is a rising incidence of HZ globally, this trend appears to be predominantly the result of an aging population. Vaccination against varicella in childhood provides significant benefits with respect to the medical, societal and economic burdens of the disease. Therefore, a theoretical concern of an increased burden of HZ with varicella vaccination programs should not prevent children from being protected against the disease.","['Wutzler P', 'Casabona G', 'Cnops J', 'Akpo EIH', 'Safadi MAP']",2018,36,46,Vaccine,"Wutzler P, et al.

30270115,Toll-like receptor signaling induces the expression of lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor in epidermal keratinocytes.,"BACKGROUND: Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor (LEKTI) tightly controls the activities of serine proteases such as kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) 5 and KLK7 in the epidermis. LEKTI is known to be an essential molecule for the epidermal skin barrier, as demonstrated by SPINK5 nonsense mutation, which results in Netherton syndrome. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns or damage-associated molecular patterns and produce inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides. However, the effect of TLR signaling on the expression of LEKTI is not clear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether TLR signaling can affect expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes.
METHODS: We stimulated a panel of TLR ligands and investigated the expression of LEKTI in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). We further measured trypsin or chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity in NHEK cultured media under stimulation with TLR3 ligand, poly (I:C). Immunostaining for LEKTI was performed using skin samples from skin infectious diseases.
RESULTS: TLR1/2, 3, 5, and 2/6 ligands induced the expression of LEKTI in NHEKs. The trypsin or chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity in NHEKs was up-regulated with the stimulation of poly (I:C). The gene expressions of KLK6, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK13 were also increased by poly (I:C). An immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression of LEKTI was up-regulated in the lesions of varicella, pyoderma, and rosacea.
CONCLUSIONS: TLR signaling induces the expression of LEKTI in epidermal keratinocytes, which might contribute to the control of aberrant serine protease activities in inflammatory skin diseases.","['Sugimoto S', 'Morizane S', 'Nomura H', 'Kobashi M', 'Sugihara S', 'Iwatsuki K']",2018,92,2,J Dermatol Sci,"Sugimoto S, et al.

30269915,Investigation of an increase in large local reactions following vaccine schedule change to include DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib (Infanrix-hexa®) and MMRV (ProQuad®) at 18 months of age.,"CONTEXT: In 2015 in Quebec, Canada, the passive vaccine adverse event reporting system detected an increase in large local reactions associated with vaccines recommended at the 18-month visit. This followed changes to the pediatric vaccine schedule to include hexavalent diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertusis-inactivated polio-Haemophilus influenzae type b-hepatitis B vaccine (DTaP-IPV-Hib-HB, Infanrix-hexa®, GSK) and quadrivalent measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV, ProQuad®, Merck) as 18-month booster doses.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if the excess of large local reactions was caused by a specific vaccine or their co-administration in the same limb or during the same visit.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted among cases born between January 2012 and April 2015 with a large local reaction following MMR ± V or DTaP-IPV-Hib ± HB vaccines administered between 16 and 23 months of age. Controls were randomly selected from the provincial medicare database among children born during the same period.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 96 cases and 494 controls vaccinated with MMRV or DTaP-IPV-Hib ± HB vaccines. Among the 96 cases, 46% had a cellulitis and 54% had an injection site reaction extending beyond the nearest joint and/or lasting ≥ 4 days. Among the 39 cases who were immunized in different limbs, 77% of the large local reactions were located at the Infanrix-hexa® site, 5% at the DTaP-IPV-Hib site and 18% at the ProQuad® site. Large local reactions were significantly more frequent with Infanrix-hexa® than with DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine (OR 5.9 95% CI: 1.4-25.7). Administration of ProQuad® and Infanrix-hexa® in the same limb did not increase the risk of large local reactions.
CONCLUSION: This investigation suggested that most large local reactions were causally associated with the Infanrix-hexa® vaccine and that the risk was not greater when ProQuad® and Infanrix-hexa® were administered in the same limb. Given the improved vaccine coverage for hepatitis B, benefit-risk analysis likely still favours ongoing use of Infanrix-hexa® with informed parental consent.","['Kiely M', 'Billard MN', 'Toth E', 'Zafack JG', 'Landry M', 'Skowronski DM', 'De Serres G']",2018,36,45,Vaccine,"Kiely M, et al.

30258269,Hemorrhagic Stroke and Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: Rare Neurological Sequelae of Chickenpox Infection.,"Chickenpox (varicella) is primarily a disease of childhood which occurs due to infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Primary VZV infection is rare in adults due to exposure in early childhood in our country. In adults, it is associated with some serious systemic and neurological complications which can follow both primary infection and reactivation of VZV. Neurological sequelae caused by primary VZV infection are rare and include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, myelitis, acute cerebellar ataxia, Reye syndrome, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and rarely stroke and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). VZV infection of cerebral vessels produces vasculopathy and hypercoagulable state, leading to complications such as stroke and CVT. We hereby report cases of two immunocompetent young adults who developed acute hemorrhagic infarction in the brain and CVT following chickenpox infection.","['Mehta A', 'Arora A', 'Sharma M', 'Malik R', 'Porwal YC']",2018,21,3,Ann Indian Acad Neurol,"Mehta A, et al.

30257814,How to manage chickenpox during pregnancy: case reports.,"Chickenpox is a human infection that occurs mainly during childhood. Infection during pregnancy is therefore rare but may cause a congenital infection with malformation in less than 1% of cases. A specific management should be proposed at diagnosis in order to reduce materno-fetal transmission and morbimortality. Three cases were herein presented focusing on the main at-risk situations for pregnant women, whom immunological status against varicella was unknown. The first case focused on a varicella eruption during early pregnancy that leads to a lethal outcome. The second one described the management of varicella contact during early pregnancy. This woman was treated by specific immunoglobulins, leading to a positive outcome. The third case focused on another varicella contact, at the end of pregnancy. The woman was treated by acyclovir, before and after delivery, to limit materno-fetal consequences. In conclusion, after a suspicious contact, a serology assay has to be performed to know the immune status of the pregnant woman against varicella. In case of seronegativity, prevention against varicella infection should be carried out using specific immunoglobulins or valacyclovir. Clinical varicella does not require virology confirmation but requires immediate treatment with valacyclovir especially when it occurs during the first trimester.","['Gaymard A', 'Pichon M', 'Bal A', 'Massoud M', 'Buenerd A', 'Massardier J', 'Combourieu D', 'Guibaud L', 'Gaucherand P', 'Lina B', 'Mekki Y', 'Morfin F', 'Bolze PA']",2018,76,6,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),"Gaymard A, et al.

30247602,Point-Counterpoint: The Hope-Simpson Hypothesis and Its Implications Regarding an Effect of Routine Varicella Vaccination on Herpes Zoster Incidence.,"Some 50 years ago, Edgar Hope-Simpson published his hypothesis regarding the interactions between varicella and herpes zoster. As part of this hypothesis, Hope-Simpson postulated that reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) was under immunological control, and that this immunological control could be boosted ""endogenously"" due to reactivation of latent VZV, and ""exogenously"" due to exposure to varicella. This hypothesis has important policy implications and remains a source of debate today; namely, does reducing VZV circulation through effective pediatric varicella vaccination programs lead to unintended increases in herpes zoster (HZ) incidence? This article provides 2 very different perspectives on this issue. The first perspective (Rafael Harpaz: Evidence Against an Effect) highlights the empiric experience of the United States, with its population of >300 million, a highly effective national varicella vaccination program lasting >20 years, and with several credible sources of data regarding HZ incidence. The US data have shown an increase in HZ incidence that preceded the availability of varicella vaccination by decades; indeed, HZ rates appear to have plateaued among older adults since varicella vaccination was introduced. Furthermore, HZ rates are not different in states having higher vs lower preschool varicella vaccination rates. The second perspective (Albert J. van Hoek: Evidence for an Effect) cites data that persons with close exposure to children appear to be at lower risk of HZ before universal VZV vaccination, but not so thereafter. Due to historic demographic changes, exogenous boosting could play a role in explaining the observed increase in HZ before varicella vaccination. Thus, it might be difficult to separate declines in exogenous boosting due to demographic changes from those caused by the varicella vaccination program. Additional data will be needed to conclusively rule out an impact of varicella vaccination on HZ.","['Harpaz R', 'van Hoek AJ']",2018,218,suppl_2,J Infect Dis,Harpaz R and van Hoek AJ.

We provide an accurate evaluation of the incidence and characteristics of ISDs diagnosed in a PED from Buenos Aires, Argentina, over a 1-year period.
METHODS: Prospectively, descriptive study of children evaluated in the PED with ISDs during 2016. ISDs were analyzed on the basis of their incidence, patient demographics, seasonal variations, and hospitalization rates.
RESULTS: ISDs were diagnosed in 1680 (67.9%) of the skin consultations (M/F: 1.1; mean age: 4.4 ± 3.7 years). Bacterial infections were observed in 932 (55.5%) cases. Viral infections were seen in 604 patients (35.9%). Fungal and parasite skin infections were diagnosed in 33 (2%) and 111 (6.6%) children, respectively. The most frequent ISDs according to the etiology group were impetigo 377 (22.4%), varicella 397 (23.6%), tinea capitis 10 (0.6%), and scabies 109 (6.5%). A higher frequency of ISDs were reported during the summer (38.4%) and spring (38.2%) months. Bacterial skin infections were more frequent during the summer months, while viral skin infections were more prevalent during spring. Parasitic skin infections were diagnosed more frequently during the winter months. No differences were seen for mycotic skin infections. Hospitalization rate was 1% (all for bacterial skin infections).
CONCLUSION: Our data reveal the extremely high frequency of ISDs seen at the PED, underlying the need for closer cooperation between dermatologists and pediatricians.","['Dei-Cas I', 'Carrizo D', 'Giri M', 'Boyne G', 'Domínguez N', 'Novello V', 'Acuña K', 'Dei-Cas P']",2019,58,3,Int J Dermatol,"Dei-Cas I, et al.

METHODS: Children with varicella or zoster from 5 Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance hospitals were enrolled. Lesions were swabbed for genotyping. Associations with disease severity were analyzed using multiple regression.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2015, 327 children with confirmed varicella (n = 238) or zoster (n = 89) were enrolled. Two hundred three (62%) were immunocompetent children; including 5 of 8 children who required intensive care unit management. Eighteen percent (36 of 203) of immunocompetent children had been previously vaccinated. Vaccinated children aged >18 months were less likely to have severe disease (9%; 5 of 56) than unvaccinated children (21%; 21 of 100; P = .05). Three of 126 children who had virus genotyping (2 immunocompromised) had varicella (n = 2) or zoster (n = 2) due to the Oka/vaccine strain. European origin clades predominated and were independently associated with more severe disease (odds ratio = 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1- 9.5; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe hospitalized varicella still occurs with a 1-dose varicella program, although predominantly in unvaccinated children. Most 1-dose vaccine recipients were protected against severe disease. Viral genotyping in complex hospitalized cases is important to assist in monitoring disease due to Oka-vaccine strain.","['Marshall HS', 'Clarke M', 'Heath C', 'Quinn H', 'Richmond PC', 'Crawford N', 'Elliott E', 'Toi C', 'Kynaston A', 'Booy R', 'Macartney K', 'PAEDS Investigators']",2019,219,3,J Infect Dis,"Marshall HS, et al.

30181734,Implementation of Hospital Policy for Healthcare Workers and Patients Exposed to Varicella-Zoster Virus.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes a highly contagious and generally benign, self-limited disease. However, in high-risk populations including immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, and neonates, VZV infection can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Healthcare-associated transmission of VZV occurs among healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients by airborne transmission or by direct contact with the index case. To minimize the risk of transmission in healthcare settings, all VZV-susceptible HCWs should be encouraged strongly to be immunized with the varicella vaccine. For post-exposure management, active immunization (varicella vaccine), passive immunization (varicella-zoster immune globulin) and/or antiviral agents, and isolation could be used in specific situations. To prevent the transmission of VZV infection in the hospital settings, the development and implementation of hospital policies for appropriate infection control is also warranted. This article reviews the general information and healthcare-associated transmission of VZV and summarizes the recommendations for the pre- and post-exposure management of HCWs and patients, in hospital settings.","['Kim SH', 'Park SH', 'Choi SM', 'Lee DG']",2018,33,36,J Korean Med Sci,"Kim SH, et al.

30156519,"[Prevalence of maternal measles, rubella, mumps and varicella antibodies in the first six months of life].","The protection of infants against infections during the first few months of life is provided mainly by maternal antibodies. The presence of maternal antibodies can decrease vaccine efficacy. The waning time of maternal antibodies shows variations therefore seroepidemiological studies are important for the development of vaccination schedules. Some recent studies showed that the maternal measles antibodies may disappear around 3 months of age especially in infants born from mothers who were vaccinated. There are few cross-sectional studies from Turkey evaluating the maternal antibody levels of infants against measles in recent years. The aim of this prospective, multicentre study is to evaluate the seropositivity of measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella in mothers and their infants at 1 and 6 months after birth. The study was carried out at the Social Pediatrics Units of two university hospitals, a private hospital and a state hospital. The exclusion criteria were known impaired immune system or immune deficiency disorder in mother or child, preterm delivery (< 37 gestational week), administration of immunoglobulins or any blood products before admission or during the follow-up period, and history of vaccination or exposure to one of these diseases during the study period. The final analysis encompassed 209 mother-infant pairs. Blood samples were collected 1 month after birth from mothers and 1 and 6 months after birth from their babies. Antibody levels were determined by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) method. Information on the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the families were collected by a face-to-face questionnaire. Seropositivity was found as 95.7%, 92.8%, 92.8% and 96.7% for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) respectively. Majority of infants lost maternal antibodies at 6 months of age. Of all 6 month-old infants 25% were seropositive for measles,14.6% for mumps, 23.2% for rubella and 17.1% for varicella. The proportion of seropositive infants born from seropositive mothers was higher than those born from seronegative mothers for all four diseases. This difference was statistically significant only at 1 month of age (p= 0.001). Our study showed that maternal antibodies against MMRV decreased rapidly by 6 months of age therefore necessary measures should be taken to close this gap between the loss of maternal protection and the vaccination of infants for MMRV. As the epidemiology of the diseases changes in time, it is important to carry out such studies with large series in different countries and settings. Important results were determined in our study within this respect.","['Devecioğlu E', 'Gökçay G', 'Boran P', 'Eren T', 'Yılmaz G', 'Badur S']",2018,52,3,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Devecioğlu E, et al.

30151702,Incidence of and Risk Factors for Cutaneous Scarring after Herpes Zoster.,"BACKGROUND: About 20% of children have cutaneous scars following chickenpox. In contrast, skin scars are not often reported after herpes zoster (HZ). Risk factors for post-HZ scarring remain undetermined.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to prospectively study the incidence of and risk factors for post-HZ scarring.
METHODS: This was a 3-year prospective study of patients with HZ attending a tertiary university hospital. Baseline data, including age, sex, immunosuppression, prior history of scarring, severity and extension of HZ, afflicted HZ dermatome, and antiviral treatment received, were recorded. At 1 month after the HZ skin lesions had healed, patients were screened for skin scars at the prior HZ site. These patients were followed every 2 months for 6 months.
RESULTS: At 6 months, 11 (9.7%) of 113 HZ patients still had post-HZ scarring (fair-skinned patients: hypopigmented [n = 3], hyperpigmented [n = 2], atrophic cicatricial [n = 3], and hypertrophic cicatricial [n = 1]; dark-skinned patients: severe hyperpigmented hypertrophic scarring [n = 2]). HZ was extensive and severe in all cases. Nine of the 11 patients were immunocompromised. Three cases had a history of hypertrophic/keloid scarring but no post-varicella scars. The most frequent location was the trunk (n = 5), followed by the cervical region (n = 3) and the face (n = 3). Given the study setting, it is possible that immunocompromized patients with severe HZ were overrepresented in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: Scarring after HZ is probably overlooked. The principal risk factors seem to be severe HZ and immunosuppression. Hence, prompt instigation of antiviral treatment for HZ and HZ vaccination could help reduce the incidence of post-HZ scarring.","['El Hayderi L', 'Nikkels-Tassoudji N', 'Nikkels AF']",2018,19,6,Am J Clin Dermatol,"El Hayderi L, et al.

30145235,Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (Shingrix) to Prevent Herpes Zoster.,"Women ages 50 years and older are at risk for herpes zoster, a reactivated virus from varicella zoster virus (chickenpox) that causes a painful vesicular rash and can result in postherpetic neuralgia. It is estimated that one in three adults will be affected by herpes zoster in their lifetime. Research evidence points to the need to prevent herpes zoster through vaccination. Since 2006, clinicians have been vaccinating adults with zoster vaccine live (brand name Zostavax), but the efficacy of this vaccine wanes with time and advanced age. In October 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant zoster vaccine under the brand name Shingrix to prevent herpes zoster. Studies have shown significantly better efficacy of Shingrix versus Zostavax. This article summarizes new guidance regarding vaccination with Shingrix and discusses implications for women's health.","['Sly JR', 'Harris AL']",2018,22,5,Nurs Womens Health,Sly JR and Harris AL.

However, in a subset of individuals, VZV may cause severe disease, including encephalitis. Host genetics is believed to be the main determinant of exacerbated disease manifestations. Recent studies have demonstrated that defects in the DNA sensor RNA polymerase III (POL III) confer selective increased susceptibility to VZV infection, thus providing fundamental new insight into VZV immunity. Here we describe the roles of POL III in housekeeping and immune surveillance during VZV infection. We present the latest knowledge on the role of POL III in VZV infection and discuss outstanding questions related to the role of POL III in VZV immunity, and how this insight can be translated into clinical medicine.","['Carter-Timofte ME', 'Paludan SR', 'Mogensen TH']",2018,24,10,Trends Mol Med,"Carter-Timofte ME, et al.

30111515,Effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis during varicella outbreaks among primary and middle school students in Shanghai: An analysis of three-year surveillance data.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis conducted during varicella outbreaks among students in Shanghai.
METHODS: Surveillance data were collected from September 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016 involving 3524 susceptible students in 109 primary and middle school classes where emergency vaccinations (EVs) had been administered. Students were divided into two groups according to their prior vaccination (PV) varicella vaccine status. A secondary attack rate was used to compare EV and non-EV groups using a chi-squared test. Stratification analyses were performed, adjusting for the EV administration date, the vaccination coverage rate, and the number of cases prior to the EV.
RESULTS: The effectiveness rate was 92.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 37.1-99.0%) when EV was applied within 3 days following the outbreak onset date, and 95.2% (95% CI: 79.9-98.8%) when vaccination coverage was ≥80% among students with PV. When students with PV received an EV for varicella within 3 days, the effectiveness rate was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: EV showed high protective effectiveness for varicella during outbreaks, especially if administered within 3 days of an outbreak and in conjunction with a high coverage rate.","['Cao Z', 'Chen D', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang D']",2018,36,38,Vaccine,"Cao Z, et al.

This study aimed to evaluate the breakthrough varicella infection rate, and to examine overall and incremental effectiveness of 2-dose varicella vaccination among Chinese children.
METHODS: A retrospective investigation was done among native children born from 2008 to 2013 in active surveillance area in Ningbo, China. Between 2009 and 2016, demographic information and data on varicella vaccination were collected by Ningbo's Immunization Information System, and information of varicella infections were obtained from China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. The logistic regression was conducted to estimate varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE).
RESULT: A total of 107,324 local children were enrolled in the cohort analysis and 95.11% of these children with no varicella disease history received at least 1-dose varicella vaccine from 2009 to 2016. The total breakthrough varicella infection rate (BVR) was 0.37% for all the vaccinated children and 0.04% for 2-dose vaccination. The annual BVR ranged from 0.01% to 0.49% for 1-dose of varicella vaccine and from 0.01% to 0.02% for 2-dose. The infection rates both in the unvaccinated children and the 1-dose children were decreasing after 2-dose vaccination implemented in 2014 (Unvaccinated: P < 0.001 for trend; 1-dose: P = 0.003 for trend). The VE against all varicella was 50.3% (95% CI: 39.8%-59.0%) for 1-dose (P < 0.001) and 98.7% (95% CI: 98.1%-99.1%) for 2-dose (P < 0.001), and the incremental VE was 97.4% (95% CI: 96.2%-98.2%) compared with 1-dose (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The 2-dose regimen provided excellent protection to prevent all varicella, and the universal 2-dose regimen of varicella vaccine should be recommended to prevent the varicella disease among children in China.","['Pan X', 'Shu M', 'Ma R', 'Fang T', 'Dong H', 'Sun Y', 'Xu G']",2018,36,37,Vaccine,"Pan X, et al.

Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 56-62. In Turkey, a single-dose varicella vaccine was introduced into the National Immunization Program in 2013. Before this implementation, varicella vaccine had been available in the private sector since 2000. However, varicella outbreaks continued to occur in preschools and elementary schools. We investigated a varicella outbreak to estimate the effectiveness of 1-dose varicella vaccine and to evaluate potential risk factors for breakthrough disease. This study was carried out during a varicella outbreak in 3 preschools in İzmir, Turkey, in April 2016. Using questionnaires, data including children`s medical and vaccination histories were collected from their parents. Attack rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated children were calculated and the analyses of vaccine effectiveness and of risk factors for breakthrough disease were conducted. A total of 124 children were enrolled in the study. Of the 124 children, 77 (62%) had received 1-dose varicella vaccine before the outbreak. Varicella developed in 34 of 124 children during the outbreak, and 18 of them (53%) had breakthrough varicella. The attack rate was 23.4% among vaccinated children and 34% among unvaccinated children. The effectiveness of single-dose varicella vaccine was 33.6% against varicella disease of any severity and 82.5% against moderate or severe varicella. Children vaccinated 5 or more years before the outbreak had 3.5 times the risk of disease than those who had been vaccinated more recently (OR 3.5 [95% CI, 1.08-11.5]); p= 0.046). Age at vaccination ( < 15 months vs.≥15 months) and the brands of varicella vaccine were not associated with the increased risk of breakthrough varicella. Our study suggests that one-dose of varicella vaccine is not sufficient to prevent school outbreaks. A 2-dose varicella vaccination program may help to prevent varicella outbreaks and achieve effective control of the disease.","['Kurugöl Z', 'Gökçe Ş']",2018,60,1,Turk J Pediatr,Kurugöl Z and Gökçe Ş.

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the immunization practices against measles, varicella and Neisseria meningitidis type C (Men C) in Italy and in Tuscany Region, during the last decades, by analyzing national and regional surveillance databases. Benefits of vaccination strategies were discussed from different points of view (clinical, epidemiological, economic, ethical, social and communicative). The implementation of measles, varicella and Men C vaccination, caused a considerable decrease of incidence rates over the years in Italy and in Tuscany too. However, in the last years, notifications of measles and Men C cases in subjects not targeted by immunization campaigns, in Italy and in Tuscany, are a cause for concern for public health and for the achievement of the elimination goals. Achieving and maintaining high vaccine coverage guarantees a decrease in the incidence of serious diseases and their clinical and economic consequences, but it is necessary to strengthen surveillance system of infectious diseases in order to monitor epidemiological trends. Moreover, outreach campaigns are necessary to raise awareness in the general population and create the culture of prevention with the same nationwide health goals for all.","['Bechini A', 'Chellini M', 'Pellegrino E', 'Tiscione E', 'Lorini C', 'Bonaccorsi G', 'Bonanni P', 'Boccalini S']",2018,59,2,J Prev Med Hyg,"Bechini A, et al.

30067732,Modeling the impact of changes in day-care contact patterns on the dynamics of varicella transmission in France between 1991 and 2015.,"Annual incidence rates of varicella infection in the general population in France have been rather stable since 1991 when clinical surveillance started. Rates however show a statistically significant increase over time in children aged 0-3 years, and a decline in older individuals. A significant increase in day-care enrolment and structures' capacity in France was also observed in the last decade. In this work we investigate the potential interplay between an increase of contacts of young children possibly caused by earlier socialization in the community and varicella transmission dynamics. To this aim, we develop an age-structured mathematical model, informed with historical demographic data and contact matrix estimates in the country, accounting for longitudinal linear increase of early childhood contacts. While the reported overall varicella incidence is well reproduced independently of mixing variations, age-specific empirical trends are better captured by accounting for an increase in contacts among pre-school children in the last decades. We found that the varicella data are consistent with a 30% increase in the number of contacts at day-care facilities, which would imply a 50% growth in the contribution of 0-3y old children to overall yearly infections in 1991-2015. Our findings suggest that an earlier exposure to pathogens due to changes in day-care contact patterns, represents a plausible explanation for the epidemiological patterns observed in France. Obtained results suggest that considering temporal changes in social factors in addition to demographic ones is critical to correctly interpret varicella transmission dynamics.","['Marziano V', 'Poletti P', 'Béraud G', 'Boëlle PY', 'Merler S', 'Colizza V']",2018,14,8,PLoS Comput Biol,"Marziano V, et al.

30062376,Herpes zoster vaccine: a protection for the elderly.,"The Herpes Zoster vaccine is strongly recommended by the World Health Organization to promote healthy aging by preventing the corresponding age- related disease, also named shingles. The disease is due to the endogenous reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus, the causal agent of chickenpox, that becomes latent at the peripheral nervous system level. Here, owing to the host's cell-mediated immunity, it may be confined for several decades. However, the immune senescence allows the possibility of virus reactivation, causing the onset of neuropathic pain and skin rash that characterize the acute disease. Sometimes, the neuralgia becomes chronic causing postherpetic neuralgia that has a significant impact on the quality of patient life, analogously to the ophthalmic HZ, a particularly feared form of disease. Due to the causal relationship between decreasing immune defenses and virus reactivation with disease onset, the incidence of Herpes Zoster, in Italy now equal to 6.42 (95%CI: 5.93-6.95) cases per 1,000 people per year will increase steadily in the future due to the longevity rise of the population. Considering epidemiological impact, complications and sequelae in the short- and long-term, costs of clinical-therapeutical management of patients, and, above all, the poor effectiveness of available therapy the only effective intervention is vaccination of the elderly. Currently in the European Union, there is only one vaccine for Herpes Zoster prevention, formed by live attenuated OKA-Merck virus strain that is also used for paediatric vaccine. According to the Health Technology Assessment surveys, the intervention cost (based on ""Quality Adjusted Life Years"") is clearly below the discriminating threshold value to judge the feasibility and, as predicted by the Italian National Plan of Vaccinal Prevention 2017-2019, the vaccine is offered free to all subjects >65 years.","['Di Pietro A', 'Facciolà A', 'Visalli G']",2018,30,4 Supple 1,Ann Ig,"Di Pietro A, et al.

30060525,Predicting Infectious Disease Using Deep Learning and Big Data.,"Infectious disease occurs when a person is infected by a pathogen from another person or an animal. It is a problem that causes harm at both individual and macro scales. The Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) operates a surveillance system to minimize infectious disease contagions. However, in this system, it is difficult to immediately act against infectious disease because of missing and delayed reports. Moreover, infectious disease trends are not known, which means prediction is not easy. This study predicts infectious diseases by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms while considering big data including social media data. The performance of the deep neural network (DNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) learning models were compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when predicting three infectious diseases one week into the future. The results show that the DNN and LSTM models perform better than ARIMA. When predicting chickenpox, the top-10 DNN and LSTM models improved average performance by 24% and 19%, respectively. The DNN model performed stably and the LSTM model was more accurate when infectious disease was spreading. We believe that this study's models can help eliminate reporting delays in existing surveillance systems and, therefore, minimize costs to society.","['Chae S', 'Kwon S', 'Lee D']",2018,15,8,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Chae S, et al.

30041832,Universal varicella vaccination increased the incidence of herpes zoster in the child-rearing generation as its short-term effect.,"BACKGROUND: Effects of universal varicella vaccination on the herpes zoster (HZ) incidence have not been elucidated. Universal varicella vaccination was introduced in Japan in October 2014.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of universal varicella vaccination on HZ epidemiology.
METHODS: Patients with HZ have been monitored by the Miyazaki Dermatologist Society since 1997, and the effects of universal vaccination on the HZ incidences have been analyzed to determine which generation is most affected.
RESULTS: The number of HZ patients increased 1.54 times, and the gradual increase in the HZ incidence was observed in not only patients >60 years, but also other generations during the period from 1997 to 2017. The number of varicella patients was gradually reduced from 2010 to 2017 before introduction of universal varicella vaccination, and the HZ incidence in yearly change significantly increased from 2014 to 2016 in the total population associated with the significant decrease in varicella incidence. The HZ incidence significantly increased for individuals aged 20 to 49 years from 2014 to 2015 and most for individuals age 20-29 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.270; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.071-1.505, P<0.001). We identified the child-rearing generation of age 20 to 49 years (OR, 1.270; 95% CI, 1.071-1.505, P<0.001) as the generation most influenced by universal varicella vaccination, when the HZ incidence increased gradually by approximately 2% per year.

30041621,Varicella infections in patients with end stage renal disease: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: End stage renal disease (ESRD) is on the rise globally. Varicella infection among adult patients with ESRD has been reported to lead to multiple complications and even death. While varicella vaccination has been recommended in paediatric renal patients; recommendation on varicella vaccination among adult patients with ESRD remained sparse. This review is aimed at evaluating the impact of varicella infection among adult patients with ESRD and make a recommendation for vaccination.
METHODS: Three databases (PubMed, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)) were searched in April 2018 with keywords 'varicella, chronic kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, kidney transplantation, end stage renal disease, end stage renal failure, chicken pox, vaccine, vaccination and complications'.
RESULTS: 29 articles were selected for review. The studies were mainly case reports, and they included measured outcomes: prevalence of seronegativity, impact (morbidity, length of stay, and mortality) of varicella among patients with ESRD, seroconversion rates and safety of varicella vaccination. The prevalence of seronegativity among varicella-infected ESRD adults was found to be at 42 to 100%. Nineteen deaths were reported. At least 54 patients have had complications from varicella infection. Seroconversion rate post vaccination was found to be around 64-94%.
CONCLUSION: Varicella is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates in adult patients with ESRD. Varicella vaccination should be considered for the vulnerable, seronegative patients.","['Ong CY', 'Low SG', 'Vasanwala FF', 'Baikunje S', 'Low LL']",2018,19,1,BMC Nephrol,"Ong CY, et al.

Methods From 2014-2016, a multi-stage stratified random sampling method was employed to select participants included via physical examination for children in the Community Health Centre in Hangzhou. Results were compared among 11 various age groups: 1-,2-,3-,4-,5-,6-,7-,8-,9-,10-,11-14 years. Demographic data and vaccination history of all subjects derived from Zhejiang Information System for Immunization Program. Then, the second dose of the VarV was conducted on children aged 4-6 years who had immunization history of one dose of VarV. ELISA was used to detect VZV IgG in serum samples. Results 895 subjects with available information were included. The rate of VZV IgG seropositivity was 65.59% and the geometric mean concentration (GMC) for VZV IgG was 5.14 ± 1.89 mIU/ml. The GMC in urban subjects were higher than rural ones. Both the rate of VZV IgG seropositivity and the GMC in children aged 4-6 years groups were statistically lower than participants younger than 4 years and aged 7-14 years (1-,2-,3-,7-,8-,9-,10-,11-14 years). 627 subjects had immunization history of VarV. Both the rate of VZV IgG seropositivity and the GMC in subjects had immunization history of VarV was higher than who had no immunization history.90 subjects were included after the 2nd dose immunization of VarV. Both the rate of VZV IgG seropositivity and the GMC were significantly increased after the immunization of the 2nd dose of VarV. Conclusions The GMC for VZV IgG in children aged 4-6 years were lower than participants groups (1-,2-,3-,7-,8-,9-,10-,11-14 years).2 doses regimen immunization of VarV are effective for increasing both the rate of VZV IgG seropositivity and the GMC in these subjects.","['Xu Y', 'Liu S', 'Che X', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang X', 'Du J', 'Zhang X', 'Wang J', 'Xu E']",2018,14,10,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Xu Y, et al.

30014823,Case Report: Delayed Diagnosis of Congenital Malaria by Plasmodium vivax in a Newborn of an Eritrean Woman with Varicella Infection.,"Congenital malaria (CM) is uncommon in both malaria-endemic and non-endemic countries. It may be caused by any Plasmodium spp., although Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the more frequent etiologic agents. We report a case of delayed diagnosis of CM by P. vivax in a newborn of an Eritrean primigravida. The mother developed pregnancy-related immunodepression and varicella-zoster viral infection 9 days before natural delivery; therefore, the child was admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to administer specific varicella-zoster immunoglobulin prophylaxis and for clinical monitoring. During the NICU stay, the newborn presented a febrile syndrome with vomiting, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. A P. vivax severe malaria diagnosis was made by detecting trophozoites in the thick and thin blood smears. The infant was successfully treated with intravenous artesunate and clindamycin. Our experience suggests that malaria diagnostic tests need to be included in routine blood analyses in newborns with febrile syndrome from mothers with an epidemiologic link to malaria-endemic areas.","['Gebremeskel Tekle S', 'Corpolongo A', ""D'Abramo A"", 'Giancola ML', 'Iannetta M', 'Scorzolini L', 'Marcozzi P', 'Buffone E', 'Liuzzi G', 'Nicastri E']",2018,99,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Gebremeskel Tekle S, et al.

30012132,"The impact of demographic changes, exogenous boosting and new vaccination policies on varicella and herpes zoster in Italy: a modelling and cost-effectiveness study.","BACKGROUND: The present study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the newly introduced varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination programmes in Italy. The appropriateness of the introduction of the varicella vaccine is highly debated because of concerns about the consequences on HZ epidemiology and the expected increase in the number of severe cases in case of suboptimal coverage levels.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis based on a stochastic individual-based model that considers realistic demographic processes and two different underlying mechanisms of exogenous boosting (temporary and progressive immunity). Routine varicella vaccination is given with a two-dose schedule (15 months, 5-6 years). The HZ vaccine is offered to the elderly (65 years), either alone or in combination with an initial catch-up campaign (66-75 years). The main outcome measures are averted cases and deaths, costs per quality-adjusted life years gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary benefits associated with the different vaccination policies.
RESULTS: Demographic processes have contributed to shaping varicella and HZ epidemiology over the years, decreasing varicella circulation and increasing the incidence of HZ. The recent introduction of varicella vaccination in Italy is expected to produce an enduring reduction in varicella incidence and, indirectly, a further increase of HZ incidence in the first decades, followed by a significant reduction in the long term. However, the concurrent introduction of routine HZ vaccination at 65 years of age is expected to mitigate this increase and, in the longer run, to reduce HZ burden to its minimum. From an economic perspective, all the considered policies are cost-effective, with the exception of varicella vaccination alone when considering a time horizon of 50 years. These results are robust to parameter uncertainties, to the two different hypotheses on the mechanism driving exogenous boosting, and to different demographic projection scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: The recent introduction of a combined varicella and HZ vaccination programme in Italy will produce significant reductions in the burden of both diseases and is found to be a cost-effective policy. This programme will counterbalance the increasing trend of zoster incidence purely due to demographic processes.","['Melegaro A', 'Marziano V', 'Del Fava E', 'Poletti P', 'Tirani M', 'Rizzo C', 'Merler S']",2018,16,1,BMC Med,"Melegaro A, et al.

29996671,Complex interaction between mutant HNRNPA1 and gE of varicella zoster virus in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system causing axonal injury, neuronal loss, and atrophy of the central nervous system leading to permanent neurological and clinical disability. Presence of mutations in M9 domain of HNRNPA1 and detection of autoantibodies against this domain in HNRNPA1 qualifies it as a strong candidate for causing MS. These two aspects indicate the presence of a facilitator in associating them. Varicella zoster virus (VZV), known to cause chicken pox infection in humans, is a significant contender in sensitizing the infected people towards MS. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses by other infectious agents and cross-recognition of common viral antigens with antigens found in the myelin sheath induces molecular mimicry or superantigens. Mutations in HNRNPA1 cause mislocalization to the cytoplasm, and co-localize with stress granules (SG) causing cellular apoptosis, this creates the first step toward MS pathogenesis. Mutant HNRNPA1 accumulates in SG allowing the cells to display peptides of HNRNPA1 on surfaces of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I triggering a cascade of immune reactions. Since glycoprotein E (gE) of VZV shares >62% amino acids sequence similarity with Prion-like domain (PrLD) of HNRNPA1, signifying the reason behind autoantibodies against M9 and PrLD of HNRNPA1. This review attempts to delineate the interactions of VZV, gE of VZV, with M9 domain and PrLD of HNRNPA1 in a step-by-step process. This supports the tripartite model that an environmental trigger in genetically susceptible individuals causes an autoimmune response to self-CNS antigens that result in the pathology observed in the brain and spinal cord of MS patients.","['Kattimani Y', 'Veerappa AM']",2018,51,4,Autoimmunity,Kattimani Y and Veerappa AM.

29942688,Evaluation of the effect of chickenpox vaccination on shingles epidemiology using agent-based modeling.,"BACKGROUND: Biological interactions between varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles), two diseases caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), continue to be debated including the potential effect on shingles cases following the introduction of universal childhood chickenpox vaccination programs. We investigated how chickenpox vaccination in Alberta impacts the incidence and age-distribution of shingles over 75 years post-vaccination, taking into consideration a variety of plausible theories of waning and boosting of immunity.
METHODS: We developed an agent-based model representing VZV disease, transmission, vaccination states and coverage, waning and boosting of immunity in a stylized geographic area, utilizing a distance-based network. We derived parameters from literature, including modeling, epidemiological, and immunology studies. We calibrated our model to the age-specific incidence of shingles and chickenpox prior to vaccination to derive optimal combinations of duration of boosting (DoB) and waning of immunity. We conducted paired simulations with and without implementing chickenpox vaccination. We computed the count and cumulative incidence rate of shingles cases at 10, 25, 50, and 75 years intervals, following introduction of vaccination, and compared the difference between runs with vaccination and without vaccination using the Mann-Whitney U-test to determine statistical significance. We carried out sensitivity analyses by increasing and lowering vaccination coverage and removing biological effect of boosting.
RESULTS: Chickenpox vaccination led to a decrease in chickenpox cases. The cumulative incidence of chickenpox had dropped from 1,254 cases per 100,000 person-years pre chickenpox vaccination to 193 cases per 100,000 person-years 10 years after the vaccine implementation. We observed an increase in the all-ages shingles cumulative incidence at 10 and 25 years post chickenpox vaccination and mixed cumulative incidence change at 50 and 75 years post-vaccination. The magnitude of change was sensitive to DoB and ranged from an increase of 22-100 per 100,000 person-years at 10 years post-vaccination for two and seven years of boosting respectively (
DISCUSSION: Our model demonstrates that over the longer time period, there will be a reduction in shingles incidence driven by the depletion of the source of shingles reactivation; however in the short to medium term some age cohorts may experience an increase in shingles incidence. Our model offers a platform to further explore the relationship between chickenpox and shingles, including analyzing the impact of different chickenpox vaccination schedules and cost-effectiveness studies.","['Rafferty E', 'McDonald W', 'Qian W', 'Osgood ND', 'Doroshenko A']",2018,6,,PeerJ,"Rafferty E, et al.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from May 2011 to April 2014. Patients up to 13 years of age with varicella diagnosis were included. Information was collected through interview and review of medical records. Logistic regression analysis was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 669 patients were admitted. The median age of subjects was 2.7 years (range 0-14 years) with a predominance of boys (56.6%). The main causes of hospitalization were bacterial complications (77.7%), viral complications (11.4%), and at-risk patients (10.9%). Main bacterial complications were skin infection and pneumonia. Main viral complications were herpes zoster, cerebellitis, and encephalitis. Most at-risk patients used corticosteroids or had a diagnosis of leukemia. At-risk patients were hospitalized earlier (
CONCLUSIONS: Secondary bacterial infection is the main cause of hospitalization, and thrombocytopenia in these patients leads to worse outcomes. Difficulties of access to the health system and delay in medical care are determining factors of greater severity in this population.","['Diniz LMO', 'Maia MMM', 'Oliveira YV', 'Mourão MSF', 'Couto AV', 'Mota VC', 'Versiani CM', 'Silveira PODC', 'Romanelli RMC']",2018,8,7,Hosp Pediatr,"Diniz LMO, et al.

29909816,"Seroepidemiology of varicella zoster virus infection in Vojvodina, Serbia.","The present cross-sectional serosurvey constitutes the first effort to describe the varicella zoster virus (VZV) seroepidemiology in Serbia. An age-stratified serum bank of 3570 residual samples collected between 2015 and 2016 in each of the seven districts of the Vojvodina Province was tested for IgG anti-VZV antibodies with an enzyme immunoassay. Results were standardised into common units according to the European Sero-Epidemiology Network (ESEN2) methodology. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to examine the relationships between standardised anti-VZV positivity or logarithmically transformed antibody titres and demographic features of study subjects. Seropositivity (85% overall) increased with age, in parallel with geometric mean titres. By the time of school entry, 68% of children were immune. The slower subsequent acquisition of immunity leaves epidemiologically relevant proportions of adolescents (7%), young adults (6%) and especially females of reproductive age (6%) prone to more severe forms of varicella. In the ongoing pre-vaccine era, natural infection provides a high level of collective immunity, with the highest VZV transmission in children of preschool age.

29908025,Seroprevalence and social determinants of varicella in Turkey.,"BACKGROUND: In Turkey, varicella vaccine was introduced into routine childhood immunization in 2013, with a single dose administered to children aged 12 months. However, there is limited information on the morbidity (incidence and seroprevalence), mortality and burden of disease of varicella in the overall Turkish population.
AIM: To determine varicella seroprevalence and its social determinants in Manisa Province, Turkey in children aged > 2 years before single-dose varicella vaccination was introduced in 2013.
METHODS: The presence of anti varicella-zoster virus IgG antibodies was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples collected from 1250 participants.
RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 92.8% and the seroprevalence was > 90% among all age groups except 2-9 years (55.7%). Seroprevalence was significantly associated with family size, annual per capita equivalent income, number of people per room and education level. After adjusting by age, only education level remained significantly associated with seroprevalence, reflecting the early age effect.
CONCLUSION: High seroprevalance depends on natural exposure to the infectious agent itself and is not associated with social determinants. High vaccine coverage should be maintained for effective varicella control and switching to a 2-dose schedule may also be considered to reduce the number and size of outbreaks in the Turkish population.","['Hekimoğlu CH', 'Özbek ÖA', 'Emek M', 'Öktem MA', 'Köroğlu G', 'Sertel M', 'Özdeniz S', 'Ceylan A', 'Açikgöz A', 'Ünal B']",2018,24,3,East Mediterr Health J,"Hekimoğlu CH, et al.

The urologic system is a rare but often debilitating target. This paper reviews the epidemiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management of VZV as it relates to urologic practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the query ""herpes zoster"" and ""varicella-zoster virus"" combined with multiple urological terms.
RESULTS: Infection caused by VZV, specifically the resurgent clinical infection herpes zoster (HZ), is prevalent and increasing. It often affects older men and women and those in immunocompromised states and usually manifests as a painful cutaneous rash. However, urological conditions such as voiding dysfunction, erectile issues, and flank pain have also been noted in conjunction with an HZ infection. Additionally, urological procedures and treatments may incite an HZ outbreak. Awareness and prompt treatment can ameliorate the intensity and duration of this infection.
CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of the atypical manifestations of HZ and disseminated VZV infection may aid urologic practitioners in avoiding misdiagnosis and delay of treatment.","['Kasabwala K', 'Wise GJ']",2018,25,3,Can J Urol,Kasabwala K and Wise GJ.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the 2007-2014 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen), which collects information on adolescents aged 13 to 17 years in the United States.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2014, varicella vaccination coverage with 2 or more doses increased from 8.3% to 66.9% in 13- to 15-year-olds and from 3.6% to 56.7% in 16- to 17-year-olds. The proportions with evidence of immunity also increased from 68.0% to 84.1% (13- to 15-year-olds) and 78.6% to 83.4% (16- to 17-year-olds). In 2014, 13.4% of 13- to 15-year-olds and 3.2% of 16- to 17-year-olds had received their second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Factors most significantly associated with lower coverage with 2 or more doses were not having an 11- to 12-year well-child visit, not receiving an adolescent vaccine, and residence in a state with no 2-dose immunization school entry requirement. Seventy-seven percent of 1-dose vaccinated adolescents had 1 or more missed opportunities to receive their second dose; if were they not missed, 2-dose coverage would have increased from 79.5% to 94.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of varicella vaccination coverage with 2 or more doses and the proportion of adolescents with evidence of immunity increased from 2007 to 2014, though 16% lacked evidence of immunity in 2014. Although catch-up campaigns have succeeded, missed vaccination opportunities persist.","['Leung J', 'Reagan-Steiner S', 'Lopez A', 'Jeyarajah J', 'Marin M']",2019,25,3,J Public Health Manag Pract,"Leung J, et al.

29887897,"Varicella infection in the Middle East: Prevalence, complications, and vaccination.","Varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), it is a mild self-limiting infection, but it is also highly contagious and can cause severe complications among high-risk group of individuals. It is usually a childhood infection providing lifelong immunity, but adults without varicella history are also susceptible to infection. High-risk group of individuals is more likely to develop serious complications. Varicella vaccine was introduced to protect this group of individuals and to prevent epidemic spread of VZV infection in a community. Thus, it was added to the recommended vaccination schedules for children in most developed countries. This review aimed to outline varicella status, seroprevalence, complications, and vaccination in the Middle East region. Based on our findings, children were the most affected age group, but there are also adult cases due to high number of expatriates, especially in Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Central nervous system involvements and skin diseases followed by varicella pneumonia were the most varicella-associated complications. Varicella vaccine was introduced in most Middle East countries, either mandatory by the Ministries of Health or optional in the private clinics. Few numbers of studies have reported an obvious reduction in varicella prevalence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the Middle East following varicella vaccination. A basic database about varicella infection before the initiation and implementation of a vaccination policy is essential to determine the target group of individuals. As far as our knowledge, this is the first review about varicella infection in the Middle East.","['Al-Turab M', 'Chehadeh W']",2018,23,,J Res Med Sci,"Al-Turab M and Chehadeh W.

29886856,Post-immunisation fever and the antibody response to measles-containing vaccines.,"Fever is a common adverse event following measles vaccination, more frequent among older children and those receiving Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella vaccine vs. Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine, two factors associated with a better antibody response. However, the role of fever in the immunogenicity of measles-containing vaccines (MCV) is unclear. We performed a post-hoc pooled analysis of data of 5 216 11 to 22 month-old children receiving MCV from 2004 to 2012 in Europe and USA to evaluate the association between post-immunisation fever and antibody response, measured by geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). We further evaluated fever as an effect modifier or a mediator in the associations between the type of MCV or the age at first vaccination and vaccine immunogenicity. After the first dose, fever was associated with 60% higher GMCs (95% CI 1.51-1.68). For children vaccinated at ⩾12 months, the fever did not modify and minimally mediated (2% to 3%) the association between age and antibody response. Fever mediated 18% of the association between type of MCV and GMCs. In a model including fever, age and type of vaccine, fever was the strongest predictor of GMCs. These results suggest that fever is associated with a stronger measles antibody response independently of age and type of MCV.","['Carazo Perez S', 'Bureau A', 'De Serres G']",2018,146,12,Epidemiol Infect,"Carazo Perez S, et al.

Information about 213 MM cases and 1128 healthy controls were obtained from a multicentre population-based Italian case-control study. The association between chickenpox, measles, mumps, pertussis and rubella and the MM risk was estimated by unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender and residence area. No association was found between MM risk and any considered infectious disease. The number of infections was slightly inversely associated with the risk of MM, but statistical significance was not reached (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.55-1.4 for 1-2 diseases vs. none and OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.41-1.1 for 3-5 diseases, respectively, P = 0.131).

29804461,Participatory capacity building for improving quality of childcare centers in Thailand.,"INTRODUCTION: Childcare centers (CCCs) with good quality standards can be effective in reducing the risk of diseases being easily spread from person to person. The aim of the present study's program, adapted from a method used by the United Nations Development Program, was to increase the capacity of local administrators(s) and heads of CCCs to improve quality standards.
METHODS: This study was quasi-experimental, with a one group pretest-post-test design. In this study the authors describe the effects and impacts of the program in Chonburi Province in eastern Thailand. Six LAs and 48 CCC heads were trained regarding (1) knowledge of the Thai Department of Health quality standards, (2) implementation and assurance and (3) program evaluation. The program consisted of three sequential participatory workshops. Effects at the center level were increased overall knowledge of quality standards of CCCs (QCCC), and developed skills of improvement plans. The impact at the center level was CCCs achieving the QCCC. At the child level it was the reduction in the period prevalence of three diseases and two symptoms.
RESULTS: The significant (p<0.05) effects and impacts at the center level were increased overall knowledge of QCCC in LAs and CCC heads and increased overall managerial skills of CCC heads. At the child level, the period prevalence of chickenpox and diarrhea symptom were reduced.
CONCLUSION: Participatory capacity building is an appropriate way to enhance the managerial skills of LAs and heads of CCCs for improving quality of CCCs to meet the local authority and the Ministry of Public Health quality standards.","['Petcharoen H', 'Suwannapong N', 'Howteerakul N', 'Tipayamongkholgul M', 'Ramaswamy R']",2018,18,2,Rural Remote Health,"Petcharoen H, et al.

29802481,Management of chickenpox in pregnant women: an Italian perspective.,"Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by primary infection of varicella zoster virus (VZV). The disease is spread worldwide and is usually benign but, in some groups of population like pregnant women, can have a severe outcome. Due to a not optimal vaccination coverage, a relatively high number of childbearing-aged women in a European country such as Italy tested seronegative for VZV and so are currently at risk of acquiring chickenpox during pregnancy, especially if they live in contact with children for family or work reasons. Only few data are available about the risk of infection in this setting: the incidence of chickenpox may range from 1.5 to 4.6 cases/1000 childbearing females and from 1.21 to 6 cases/10,000 pregnant women, respectively. This review is aimed to focus on the epidemiology and the clinical management of exposure to chickenpox during pregnancy. Particular emphasis is given to the accurate screening of childbearing women at the time of the first gynecological approach - the females who tested susceptible to infection can be counseled about the risks and instructed on procedure should contact occur - and to the early prophylaxis of the at-risk exposure. Lastly, the achievement of adequate vaccination coverage of the Italian population remains a cornerstone in the prevention of chickenpox in pregnancy.","['Parente S', 'Moriello NS', 'Maraolo AE', 'Tosone G']",2018,37,9,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Parente S, et al.

VariZIG®, not commercialized in France, is a good alternative for seronegative individuals exposed to the virus and not eligible for vaccination. The efficacy of routine vaccination has been demonstrated with a decrease in chickenpox incidence and with the development of herd immunity. Over time, the protective antibody titer of vaccinated people decreases and can be maintained by two doses of the vaccine. A tetravalent measles-mumps-rubella-chickenpox vaccine, used in the United States, has a good tolerability in spite of the occurrence of fever and febrile seizures. Routine vaccination would contribute to make savings in France, by reducing direct and indirect costs of chickenpox.","['Lo Presti C', 'Curti C', 'Montana M', 'Bornet C', 'Vanelle P']",2019,49,1,Med Mal Infect,"Lo Presti C, et al.

29781861,Clinico-Pathological Study of 4 Cases of Pseudoherpetic Grover Disease: The Same as Vesicular Grover Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Grover disease (GD) was described with 4 histopathological patterns, but later wide histopathological studies found additional ones including vesicular GD. From 2014, 2 new patterns, GD with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis and pseudoherpetic GD, have been proposed.
OBJECTIVES: The authors present 4 cases of pseudoherpetic GD and review the 6 previously published cases to better characterize this variant clinically and histopathologically.
RESULTS: Half of the patients were men. Mean age at diagnosis was 70, 25 years old. All the patients were immunosuppressed, and 75% of them were treated with chemotherapy. Lesions were asymptomatic or itchy papules sometimes crusted and intermingled with isolated vesicles or pustules mostly in the trunk. Skin biopsies showed intraepidermal vesicles filled with plasma (50%) with floating grouped acantholytic cells. No viral inclusions were found, and immunostaining for herpes virus and varicella zoster was negative.
DISCUSSION: Vesicular pattern in GD is described exclusively from a histopathological point of view, and it is defined as the presence of an intraepidermal vesicle filled with plasma and with dyskeratotic cells in the upper part of the vesicle. After reviewing all the described cases, pseudoherpetic GD presents the same histopathological features than vesicular GD, but authors paid attention to the presence of grouped acantholytic cells mimicking multinucleated cells of herpes infection. The authors consider that the so-called pseudoherpetic GD is a vesicular GD, where clinical suspicion of varicella raises this differential diagnosis and leads us to check viral nuclear cytopathic changes, and the authors favor the use of vesicular GD in the dermatopathologist report.","['Capusan TM', 'Herrero-Moyano M', 'Fraga J', 'Llamas-Velasco M']",2018,40,6,Am J Dermatopathol,"Capusan TM, et al.

29779720,"Search engines, news wires and digital epidemiology: Presumptions and facts.","BACKGROUND: Digital epidemiology tries to identify diseases dynamics and spread behaviors using digital traces collected via search engines logs and social media posts. However, the impacts of news on information-seeking behaviors have been remained unknown.
METHODS: Data employed in this research provided from two sources, (1) Parsijoo search engine query logs of 48 months, and (2) a set of documents of 28 months of Parsijoo's news service. Two classes of topics, i.e. macro-topics and micro-topics were selected to be tracked in query logs and news. Keywords of the macro-topics were automatically generated using web provided resources and exceeded 10k. Keyword set of micro-topics were limited to a numerable list including terms related to diseases and health-related activities. The tests are established in the form of three studies. Study A includes temporal analyses of 7 macro-topics in query logs. Study B considers analyzing seasonality of searching patterns of 9 micro-topics, and Study C assesses the impact of news media coverage on users' health-related information-seeking behaviors.
RESULTS: Study A showed that the hourly distribution of various macro-topics followed the changes in social activity level. Conversely, the interestingness of macro-topics did not follow the regulation of topic distributions. Among macro-topics, ""Pharmacotherapy"" has highest interestingness level and wider time-window of popularity. In Study B, seasonality of a limited number of diseases and health-related activities were analyzed. Trends of infectious diseases, such as flu, mumps and chicken pox were seasonal. Due to seasonality of most of diseases covered in national vaccination plans, the trend belonging to ""Immunization and Vaccination"" was seasonal, as well. Cancer awareness events caused peaks in search trends of ""Cancer"" and ""Screening"" micro-topics in specific days of each year that mimic repeated patterns which may mistakenly be identified as seasonality. In study C, we assessed the co-integration and correlation between news and query trends. Our results demonstrated that micro-topics sparsely covered in news media had lowest level of impressiveness and, subsequently, the lowest impact on users' intents.
CONCLUSION: Our results can reveal public reaction to social events, diseases and prevention procedures. Furthermore, we found that news trends are co-integrated with search queries and are able to reveal health-related events; however, they cannot be used interchangeably. It is recommended that the user-generated contents and news documents are analyzed mutually and interactively.","['Kaveh-Yazdy F', 'Zareh-Bidoki AM']",2018,115,,Int J Med Inform,"Kaveh-Yazdy F and Zareh-Bidoki AM.

HZ typically develops as people age, due to decreased cell-mediated immunity. However, the importance of antibodies for immunity against HZ prevention remains to be understood. The goal of this study was to examine the breadth and functionality of VZV-specific antibodies after vaccination with a live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zostavax). Direct enumeration of VZV-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) via enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT assay) showed that Zostavax can induce both IgG and IgA ASCs 7 days after vaccination but not IgM ASCs. The VZV-specific ASCs range from 33 to 55% of the total IgG ASCs. Twenty-five human VZV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were cloned and characterized from single-cell-sorted ASCs of five subjects (>60 years old) who received Zostavax. These MAbs had an average of ∼20 somatic hypermutations per VH gene, similar to those seen after seasonal influenza vaccination. Fifteen of the 25 MAbs were gE specific, whereas the remaining MAbs were gB, gH, or gI specific.

29716545,Management and control of communicable diseases in schools and other child care settings: systematic review on the incubation period and period of infectiousness.,"BACKGROUND: Information on the incubation period and period of infectiousness or shedding of infectious pathogens is critical for management and control of communicable diseases in schools and other childcare settings.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review (Pubmed and Embase) to identify and critically appraise all relevant published articles using incubation, infectiousness or shedding, and exclusion period as parameters for the search. No language, time, geographical or study design restrictions were applied.
RESULTS: A total of 112 articles met the eligibility criteria. A relatively large number were retrieved for gastrointestinal diseases and influenza or respiratory syncytial virus, but there were few or no studies for other diseases. Although a considerable number of publications reported the incubation and shedding periods, there was less evidence concerning the period of infectiousness. On average, five days of exclusion is considered for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and pertussis. For other diseases, such as most cases of meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and influenza exclusion is considered as long as severe symptoms persist. However, these results are based on a diverse range of study characteristics, including age, treatment, vaccination, underlying diseases, diagnostic tools, viral load, study design and definitions, making statistical analysis difficult.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite inconsistent definitions for key variables and the diversity of studies reviewed, published data provide sufficient quantitative estimates to inform decision making in schools and other childcare settings. The results can be used as a reference when deciding about the exclusion of a child with a communicable disease that both prevents exposure and avoids unnecessary absenteeism.","['Czumbel I', 'Quinten C', 'Lopalco P', 'Semenza JC', 'ECDC expert panel working group']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Czumbel I, et al.

29707592,Varicella Pneumonia: Case Report and Review of a Potentially Lethal Complication of a Common Disease.,"Varicella zoster virus causes varicella (chickenpox). It can be reactivated endogenously many years later to cause herpes zoster (shingles). Although varicella is usually a benign disease in healthy children, it resulted in over 11 000 hospitalizations and over 100 deaths every year, in all ages, in the United States. Morbidity was considerably worse in older teenagers and adults. Between 5% and 15% of cases of adult chickenpox will produce some form of pulmonary illness. Progression to pneumonia risk factors include pregnancy, age, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunosuppression. Typically, pulmonary symptoms occur 1 to 6 days after varicella zoster infection. They often include cough, fever, and dyspnea. Treatment is a 7-day course of intravenous acyclovir for varicella pneumonia. Early intervention may modify the course of this complication. This review illustrates practical features with a case of a 34-year-old female with severe varicella pneumonia. Despite the lack of significant past medical history and absence of immunosuppression, her pneumonia worsened and by using continuous positive airway pressure mask, intubation was avoided. More important, the radiographic progression of severe varicella pneumonia is shown. This highlights how a common disease of varicella can progress in an adult and manifest with significant organ malfunction.","['Denny JT', 'Rocke ZM', 'McRae VA', 'Denny JE', 'Fratzola CH', 'Ibrar S', 'Bonitz J', 'Tse JT', 'Cohen S', 'Mellender SJ', 'Kiss GK']",2018,6,,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,"Denny JT, et al.

29668453,The Skin and the Eye - Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus in a Healthy 18-month-old Toddler.,"Herpes zoster, caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus, is uncommon in infancy. Even more uncommon is herpes zoster ophthalmicus, defined as herpes zoster of the ophthalmic branch of the fifth cranial nerve. Among healthy children, primary varicella-zoster virus infection during gestation as a result of maternal varicella or the first year of life is the major risk factor for development of herpes zoster in a relatively young age. Here we present an unusual case of herpes zoster ophthalmicus with dissemination in an immunocompetent toddler with favorable outcome. The child's mother contracted chickenpox in late pregnancy and her son was very likely infected with varicella-zoster virus in utero. During a two-year follow-up the child vision was normal and there was no evidence of post herpetic neuralgia.","['Komitova RT', 'Boykinova OB', 'Stoyanova NS']",2018,60,1,Folia Med (Plovdiv),"Komitova RT, et al.

29657373,Severe Varicella Pneumonia in Adults: Seven Years' Single-center Experience from India.,"CONTEXT: Varicella pneumonia is a rare but a serious complication of chickenpox in adults. There is paucity of data on varicella pneumonia from India.
AIMS: The aim of this study is to describe the clinical manifestations, hospital course, treatment, and outcome of adult patients with severe varicella pneumonia.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with severe varicella pneumonia attending a tertiary care teaching hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The cases of varicella were identified by a computerized search of the medical record for the period between January 2010 and December 2016. During this period, 137 patients got admitted with varicella of which 22 had severe varicella pneumonia.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Mean and standard deviation were computed. Fisher's Z-test of proportions and analysis of variance were applied.
RESULTS: There were 17 (77.3%) men and 5 (22.7%) women. The mean age of the patients was 33.4 ± 10.8 years. History of contact with an infected person followed by high-grade fever and typical rash was present in all patients. Forty-five percent (10/22) of patients were immunosuppressed. All the patients received intravenous acyclovir. Forty-five percent (10/22) of patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. The various factors associated with the need for mechanical ventilation were partial pressure of oxygen:fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <150, quick sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (qSOFA) >2, and early bacterial coinfection. The mean Intensive Care Unit and hospital stay were 7 days (range; 1-16) and 9 days (range; 4-21), respectively. The overall mortality was 22.7% and reached 50% in those requiring invasive ventilation. The mortality was higher among patients with qSOFA >3, mean arterial blood pressure <60 mmHg, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome at presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe varicella pneumonia are at an increased risk of respiratory failure and death.","['Singh A', 'Parkash S', 'Gupta SK', 'Soni RK']",2018,22,3,Indian J Crit Care Med,"Singh A, et al.

29633679,Granulysin as a novel factor for the prognosis of the clinical course of chickenpox.,"Granulysin is a recently discovered cytolytic protein of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Studies of healthy and immunocompromised patients with primary or recurrent varicella-zoster infections demonstrate the importance of virus-specific cellular immunity in controlling viral replication, but also some studies presented granulysin as a molecule that can play a role in chickenpox immunopathogenesis. This study investigated possible correlation between serum granulysin levels and clinical course of chickenpox. A total of 69 patients with chickenpox were included in the study. We measured the levels of granulysin and percentage count for CD4+, CD8+ and NK cells in serum for all patients and healthy controls. For detection and quantification of granulysin in sera, we performed ELISA test and flow cytometry for detection, identification and percentage measurement of T and B lymphocytes. Descriptive methods, analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical data analysis. We found respective correlation between serum granulysin level and severity of clinical presentation. These findings can be a good input for further studies, since there is no relevant prognostic parameter of chickenpox in everyday clinical practice. Granulysin, as a therapeutic, also deserves to be a point of interests in the future. If we prove its potential to stop dissemination of human herpes viruses, possibilities to use it in some life-threatening forms of viral disease can be very valuable.","['Baljic R', 'Gojak R', 'Konjo H', 'Hukic M']",2018,146,7,Epidemiol Infect,"Baljic R, et al.

METHODS: We reviewed ships' varicella case and outbreak reports from January 2010 through December 2015.
RESULTS: DGMQ received 967 reports of varicella and 13 reports of herpes zoster. Most varicella case-patients were 20-49 years of age (84.7%, 472/557) and were cruise ship crew members (78.4%, 758/967). Most often, cruise ship crew member case-patients were born in or held passports from Indonesia (21.7%, 80/369), Philippines (17.6%, 65/369), or India (17.3%, 64/369). Ninety-nine varicella outbreaks were reported, including 439 varicella cases and one herpes zoster case; 97 (98.0%) outbreaks occurred on cruise ships, and 90.2% of associated cases were among crew members (397/440). Most varicella cases were in crew members, who are adults often from tropical regions where varicella immunity is acquired later in childhood or young adulthood or without varicella vaccination programs.
CONCLUSION: Varicella vaccination as appropriate for susceptible travelers, particularly crew members, before maritime travel may decrease risk of varicella infection and prevent outbreaks on ships.","['Rice ME', 'Bannerman M', 'Marin M', 'Lopez AS', 'Lewis MM', 'Stamatakis CE', 'Regan JJ']",2018,23,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Rice ME, et al.

Despite the usual course a possible fatal evolution of the primary infection is observed predominantly in immunocompromised subjects and in adults, especially emigrating from tropical regions. Two cases of fatal varicella have been investigated and discussed. Death occurred in two patients over 40 years of age, coming from South Asia and receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy. The forensic expert must be cautious and consider all clinical records in managing fatal varicella cases, bearing in mind risk factors and pre-existing conditions such as age, geographical provenance and pathological comorbidity, which may lead to a bad prognosis irrespective of therapies. Based on the severe and fatal course observed in the reported cases, an extension of the immunization program appears advisable for immigrants from tropical countries, especially before scheduled immunotherapy.","['Guadagnini G', 'Lo Baido S', 'Poli F', 'Govi A', 'Borin S', 'Fais P', 'Pelotti S']",2018,32,,Leg Med (Tokyo),"Guadagnini G, et al.

29573389,[Incidence of biological accidents at work and immune status for vaccine-preventable diseases among resident physicians in specialist training at Ferrara University Hospital].,"The hospital as a work environment is particularly characterized by various risks for healthcare workers (HCWs). The main risk is represented by biological accidents, associated with the parenteral transmission of pathogens. Biological injuries can occur during the care service and the manipulation of biological fluids. Hepatitis B (and hepatitis D), hepatitis C and HIV are the most common infections transmitted by biological injuries. Physicians should acquire awareness of the risks associated with their professional activity during their training as medical residents (MRs). Some infectious diseases are preventable by vaccination and the ""National Immunization Plan 2017-2019"" (PNPV) recommends HCWs vaccination against hepatitis B, influenza, measles -mumps -rubella, chicken pox, and pertussis. Besides, not only HCWs' vaccination can prevent the disease in healthcare professionals, but it also may reduce the transmission to patients. Therefore, active immunization of HCWs by recommended vaccinations plays an important role to prevent disease cases, complications and death in patients. An increased awareness of risk behaviors is the first important point to address in order to reduce biological accidents and infectious diseases transmission, so as to reduce their frequency. Besides, HCWs' vaccination is useful to reinforce protection and to prevent the transmission of some infectious diseases in case of exposure. The aim of this five-year incidence study is to investigate the MRs' biological accidents characteristics and to analyze the MRs' immune status at the University of Ferrara in the period 2011-2015. Data on MRs' biological accidents and immune status at Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Ferrara in 2011-2015 were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2007 Software. In this study, the percentage of MRs' biological injuries compared to the total number of MRs showed an annual variability, with a peak in 2011 (11.9%). During the analyzed period, there were 190 biological injuries among the MRs: 81% were percutaneous injuries and blood was the biological fluid involved in 86.3% of cases. The most frequent lesion was puncture (62.6%), occurred in 41.1% of cases by suture needles; 46.3% of accidents occurred in the operating block. These data can be explained by the more invasive and at risk activities carried out in these Operative Units. The high injuries percentage in MRs may be related to less work experience and inadequate training or informations about personal protective equipment use. Among MRs, 93.7%, 93.3% and 96.6% were immune to measles, chicken pox and hepatitis B, respectively; only in the case of rubella, 11.9% of MRs was not immune. This research showed, accordingly to published data, high adhesion to hepatitis B vaccination. However, the healthcare workers' vaccine coverage is still sub-optimal; active immunization by recommended vaccines should be implemented for both parenteral and airborne diseases. As a matter of fact, the recent measles outbreak has involved healthcare workers (4689 cases of measles, 305 in HCWs). Finally, the General Directorates of Health-care settings should improve healthcare personnel adhesion to vaccinations, such as influenza, by promotion activities in the workplace. A proposal in order to achieve coverage objectives could be making vaccinations mandatory, as well as already implemented in other countries.","['Stefanati A', 'Brosio F', 'Kuhdari P', 'Baccello V', 'De Paris P', 'Nardini M', 'Boschetto P', 'Lupi S', 'Gabutti G']",2017,73,6,Ig Sanita Pubbl,"Stefanati A, et al.

29526171,The changing epidemiology of varicella and herpes zoster in Hong Kong before universal varicella vaccination in 2014.,"In Hong Kong, universal varicella vaccination started in July 2014. Before this, children could receive varicella vaccine via the private market. We analysed the epidemiology of varicella and zoster before universal vaccination. We estimated varicella vaccination coverage through surveys in preschool children. We estimated the burden of varicella and zoster with varicella notifications from 1999/00 to 2013/14, Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) attendance and inpatient admissions to public hospitals from 2004/05 to 2013/14. We fitted a catalytic model to serological data on antibodies against varicella-zoster virus to estimate the force of infection. We found that varicella vaccination coverage gradually increased to about 50% before programme inception. In children younger than 5 years, the annual rate of varicella notifications, varicella admission and zoster A&E attendance generally declined. The annual notification, A&E attendance and hospitalisation rate of varicella and zoster generally increased for individuals between 10 and 59 years old. Varicella serology indicated an age shift during the study period towards a higher proportion of infections in slightly older individuals, but the change was most notable before vaccine licensure. In conclusion, we observed a shift in the burden of varicella to slightly older age groups with a corresponding increase in incidence but it cannot necessarily be attributed to private market vaccine coverage alone. Increasing varicella vaccination uptake in the private market might affect varicella transmission and epidemiology, but not to the level of interrupting transmission.","['Chan DYW', 'Edmunds WJ', 'Chan HL', 'Chan V', 'Lam YCK', 'Thomas SL', 'van Hoek AJ', 'Flasche S']",2018,146,6,Epidemiol Infect,"Chan DYW, et al.

29522133,"Varicella Outbreak Surveillance in Schools in Sentinel Jurisdictions, 2012-2015.","BACKGROUND: In 2007, a routine second dose of varicella vaccine was recommended in the United States for children aged 4 to 6 years to better control varicella-zoster virus circulation and outbreaks. Sentinel varicella outbreak surveillance was established to assess feasibility of surveillance and describe outbreaks that are occurring.
METHODS: Through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemiology Laboratory Capacity funding, health departments conducted active surveillance for varicella outbreaks in schools from 2012 to 2015. Outbreaks of varicella were defined as ≥5 cases in a school within at least 1 incubation period (21 days). School nurses, healthcare providers, or laboratories reported cases and outbreaks of varicella to health departments; demographic, vaccination, and clinical data were collected.
RESULTS: Georgia, Houston, Maine, Minnesota, New York City, and Philadelphia participated in all 3 years; Puerto Rico and West Virginia participated in 2012 to 2013; and Kansas and Arkansas participated in 2014 to 2015. Twenty-nine outbreaks including 262 cases were reported. The median size of the outbreaks was 7 cases (range, 5-31 cases), and the median duration was 31 days (range, 4-100 days). Of the case-patients associated with larger outbreaks (≥8 cases), 55.4% were unvaccinated, and 15.7% and 18.1% had received 1 or 2 doses of vaccine, respectively. In small outbreaks (5-7 cases), 33.3% of case-patients were unvaccinated, and 16.7% and 38.5% had received 1 or 2 doses of vaccine, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of cases associated with outbreaks occurred in undervaccinated children (unvaccinated and 1-dose vaccine recipients). Outbreaks with a greater proportion of 2-dose vaccine recipients were smaller. Varicella outbreak surveillance is feasible, and continued monitoring of outbreaks remains important for describing the epidemiology of varicella during the 2-dose varicella vaccination program.","['Lopez AS', 'LaClair B', 'Buttery V', 'Zhang Y', 'Rosen J', 'Taggert E', 'Robinson S', 'Davis M', 'Waters C', 'Thomas CA', 'Rodriguez C', 'Thomas E', 'Tuttle J', 'Brantley T', 'Perella D', 'Del Rosario M', 'Marin M']",2019,8,2,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,"Lopez AS, et al.

Varicella or chickenpox is not uncommon among adults especially ESRD/ESRF patients. It has been reported to cause complications and even death among immunocompetent adults.
METHODS: A retrospective data collection on patients with varicella infection and ESRD in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) from the year 2005 to 2016 was performed. Continuous data and categorical data were summarized as median (range) and count (%) respectively. The association of health care utilization (total length of hospital stay, readmission related to varicella, intensive care unit admission) and mortality with complication due to varicella were tested using chi-square and Mann-Whitney test for categorical and continuous outcomes respectively.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients with ESRD developed varicella during the study period (2005-2016). The case incidence rates for varicella among ESRD ranges from 97 to 267 per 100,000 populations with ESRD yearly. There were 9 deaths (13.6%). Mortality was higher among the ESRD patients with one or more varicella complications compared to patients without complications ((25% vs 7.1%, 95% CI for difference: - 1.1%, 36.9%, p = .063).

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a single dose of ProQuad, and the population impact of a vaccination program (VP) against varicella of any severity in children who received a first dose of ProQuad at 14 months of age in the Veneto Region, METHODS: All children born in 2006/2007, i.e., eligible for varicella vaccination after ProQuad was introduced, were retrospectively followed through individual-level data linkage between the Pedianet database (varicella cases) and the Regional Immunization Database (vaccination status). The direct effectiveness of ProQuad was estimated as the incidence rate of varicella in ProQuad-vaccinated children aged < 6 years compared to children with no varicella vaccination from the same birth cohort. The impact of the VP on varicella was measured by comparing children eligible for the VP to an unvaccinated historical cohort from 1997/1998. The vaccine impact measures were: total effect (the combined effect of ProQuad vaccination and being covered by the Veneto VP); indirect effect (the effect of the VP on unvaccinated individuals); and overall effect (the effect of the VP on varicella in the entire population of the Veneto Region, regardless of their vaccination status).
RESULTS: The adjusted direct effectiveness of ProQuad was 94%. The vaccine impact measures total, indirect, and overall effect were 97%, 43%, and 90%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These are the first results on the effectiveness and impact of ProQuad against varicella; data confirmed its high effectiveness, based on immunological correlates for protection. Direct effectiveness is our only ProQuad-specific measure; all impact measures refer at least partially to the VP and should be interpreted in the context of high vaccine coverage and the use of various varicella vaccines in this region. The Veneto Region offered a unique opportunity for this study due to an individual data linkage between Pedianet and the Regional Immunization database.","['Giaquinto C', 'Gabutti G', 'Baldo V', 'Villa M', 'Tramontan L', 'Raccanello N', 'Russo F', 'Poma C', 'Scamarcia A', 'Cantarutti L', 'Lundin R', 'Perinetti E', 'Cornen X', 'Thomas S', 'Ballandras C', 'Souverain A', 'Hartwig S']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Giaquinto C, et al.

29506363,[Varicella vaccination: scientific reasons for a different strategic approach].,"The Italian Parliament has recently introduced 10 mandatory immunisations, including the one against varicella. For this vaccination, the obligation starts with the birth cohort of 2017, but it is offered free of charge to subjects with a negative history and not previously vaccinated. This paper presents up-to-date evidence on this issue and illustrates a number of critical arguments that may question the opportunity of this choice. Particularly, while the disease is relatively mild in children aged between 1 and 9 years, the risk of worsening its consequences is progressive with age, becoming worst in the elderly, so the vaccination of children may increase the age of the cases. Some vaccine side effects are not trivial and the duration of protection is still uncertain, as well as the cost-effectiveness of mass vaccination and its long-term effects, referring to virus reactivation and to the incidence of Herpes zoster in the general population, which could be increased and anticipated in the long run. Varicella vaccination is not included in international eradication goals and very few Europeans Countries have considered it as a public health priority. A different rational choice could have been to offer a selective vaccination only to adolescents with a negative history of chickenpox; or at least to delay the beginning of the universal campaign in the Italian regions that had not started the mass vaccination yet, evaluating the results over time. Lastly, this paper lists a number of preventive interventions of proven effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, with extraordinary margins of improvement, whose mandatory introduction in the population have never been considered, even as a matter of debate.","['Donzelli A', 'Demicheli V']",2018,42,1,Epidemiol Prev,Donzelli A and Demicheli V.

29499990,Prospective Study of Live Attenuated Vaccines for Patients with Nephrotic Syndrome Receiving Immunosuppressive Agents.,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a prospective study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of live attenuated vaccines in patients with nephrotic syndrome receiving immunosuppressive agents.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients with nephrotic syndrome receiving immunosuppressive agents with negative or borderline antibody titers (virus-specific IgG levels <4.0) against measles, rubella, varicella, and/or mumps fulfilling the criteria of cellular and humoral immunity were enrolled. Virus-specific IgG levels were measured using an enzyme immunoassay. The primary endpoint was the seroconversion rate (ie, achievement of virus-specific IgG levels ≥4.0) at 2 months after vaccination. Virus-specific IgG levels at 1 year, breakthrough infections (wild-type infections), and adverse events were also evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 116 vaccinations were administered to 60 patients. Seroconversion rates were 95.7% for measles, 100% for rubella, 61.9% for varicella, and 40.0% for mumps. More patients with a borderline antibody titer before vaccination achieved seroconversion than those with negative antibody titer, with statistical significance after varicella and mumps vaccination. The rate of patients who maintained seropositivity at 1 year after vaccination was 83.3% for measles, 94.1% for rubella, 76.7% for varicella, and 20.0% for mumps. No patient experienced breakthrough infection. No serious adverse events, including vaccine-associated infection, were observed.
CONCLUSION: Immunization with live attenuated vaccines may be immunogenic and is apparently safe in our cohort of patients with nephrotic syndrome receiving immunosuppressive agents if their cellular and humoral immunologic measures are within clinically acceptable levels.

29499726,Varicella-zoster-virus vaccination in immunosuppressed children with rheumatic diseases using a pre-vaccination check list.,"BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to apply the varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine to patients with pediatric rheumatic diseases (PRD) at risk for severe chickenpox, without interrupting their current immunosuppression, including biological agents, using an immunological-based pre-vaccination checklist to assure safety. A pre-vaccination checklist was implemented to ensure adequate immune competence prior to immunization.
METHODS: This prospective study included seronegative patients (VZV-IgG ≤200 mIU/ml) and patients who had previously received only a single dose of VZV vaccine. All vaccinees demonstrated clinically inactive PRD. Patients were categorized according to their actual treatment in low-intensity IS (LIIS) and high-intensity IS (HIIS) including biological therapy. The pre-vaccination checklist defined thresholds for the following basic laboratory tests: white blood cell count ≥3000/mm
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were recruited of whom nine had already received one VZV immunization before initiating IS. All patients met the pre-vaccination checklist criteria despite ongoing IS. There was no overall difference in VZV-IgG levels when comparing the LIIS (n=9) and HIIS (n=14) groups. In total, 21 patients (91%) showed a positive vaccination response, after the first immunization the median VZV-IgG across all patients was 224 (59-1219) mIU/ml (median (range)), after booster immunization it increased to 882 (30-4685) mIU/ml. Two patients in the HIIS group failed to raise positive VZV-IgG, despite booster immunization. All nine patients receiving only the second immunization on IS reached high titers of VZV-IgG >500 mIU/ml (1117 (513-4685) mIU/ml). There were no cases of rash or other vaccine-induced varicella disease symptoms and no evidence of PRD flare.
CONCLUSIONS: VZV vaccination is safe and largely immunogenic in children with ongoing IS fulfilling an immunological based pre-vaccination checklist. This new approach is based on immunologic function rather than on type of medications.

Childhood varicella vaccination, as recommended in Germany in 2004, may reduce the risk of HZ in vaccinated children but also virus circulation and thus the booster possibility of latent infected persons. In this context we analyzed age-specific trends in HZ epidemiology in Germany using data on HZ-associated outpatient consultations in participating sentinel sites and HZ-associated cases in all hospitals since 2005. We analyzed two separate time periods that differed in sentinel management and data integrity. For the period 2005-2010, we found a decrease in HZ-associated outpatient consultations in 1- to 4-year-olds (IRR = 0.72, 95%CI 0.63-0.81, p<0.001). For the period 2013-2016, we observed a decrease in HZ-associated outpatient consultations in 10- to 14-year-olds (IRR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.78-0.93, p<0.01). Moreover, we detected an increase in the age groups 20 years and older except for the group 30-39 years. HZ-associated hospitalizations showed similar trends for the second time period (here 2012-2015). The decrease in HZ-associated outpatient consultations and hospitalizations in children started and continued over cohorts eligible for varicella vaccination and could be a result of their reduced HZ-risk. Whether the observed steady increasing HZ incidences for adults are associated with the varicella vaccination in children remains unclear and could not be investigated with our data.","['Zoch-Lesniak B', 'Tolksdorf K', 'Siedler A']",2018,14,7,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Zoch-Lesniak B, et al.

Although varicella is generally a mild self-limiting illness, in immunocompromised subjects and adults it can have a serious clinical course that can lead to permanent damage of the central nervous system. In these and in most zoster cases, treatment with anti-herpetic drugs and/or immunotherapy is necessary. Because it is highly contagious, varicella is one of the most common exanthematic diseases. It is preventable by vaccination with an attenuated vaccine administered around the first year of age, and with a boost vaccination in school age.

29496631,The utility of LASSO-based models for real time forecasts of endemic infectious diseases: A cross country comparison.,"INTRODUCTION: Accurate and timely prediction for endemic infectious diseases is vital for public health agencies to plan and carry out any control methods at an early stage of disease outbreaks. Climatic variables has been identified as important predictors in models for infectious disease forecasts. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to produce accurate and timely predictions and potentially improve public health response.
METHODS: We assessed how the machine learning LASSO method may be useful in providing useful forecasts for different pathogens in countries with different climates. Separate LASSO models were constructed for different disease/country/forecast window with different model complexity by including different sets of predictors to assess the importance of different predictors under various conditions.
RESULTS: There was a more apparent cyclicity for both climatic variables and incidence in regions further away from the equator. For most diseases, predictions made beyond 4 weeks ahead were increasingly discrepant from the actual scenario. Prediction models were more accurate in capturing the outbreak but less sensitive to predict the outbreak size. In different situations, climatic variables have different levels of importance in prediction accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: For LASSO models used for prediction, including different sets of predictors has varying effect in different situations. Short term predictions generally perform better than longer term predictions, suggesting public health agencies may need the capacity to respond at short-notice to early warnings.","['Chen Y', 'Chu CW', 'Chen MIC', 'Cook AR']",2018,81,,J Biomed Inform,"Chen Y, et al.

29433132,[The economic value of vaccinations: a systematic review of Italian economic evaluations and HTA reports].,"INTRODUCTION: Decision-making in healthcare should rely on evidence-based approaches able to make possible a transparent and robust assessment of all the aspects related to health technologies. One of the assessment elements is represented by the efficiency that is the specific objective of economic evaluations and also of Health Technology Assessment (HTA). The collection and synthesis of evidence is the first indispensable step in order to foster a proper convey of scientific knowledge to the decision-makers. This work, carried out within a broader project on the transfer of evidence from the scientific to the decision making world, is aimed to release an overview of economic evaluations and HTA on vaccines conducted in Italy. The project was carried out within the activities of the ISPOR Italy-Rome Chapter.
METHODS: A systematic review of Italian economic evaluations and HTA performed on vaccines and published up to May 2015 was carried out. PubMed, Scopus and the NIHR HTA databases were queried and a hand-search was performed on key journals in the field (Global & Regional Health Technology Assessment; PharmacoEconomics Italian Research Articles; Giornale italiano di HTA; Politiche Sanitarie; HTA Focus - Pills of Clinical Governance; Pillole di Farmacoeconomia; Giornale Italiano di Farmacoeconomia e Farmacoutilizzazione; IJPH; Quaderni dell'IJPH). Studies were considered eligible if showing the results of a full economic evaluations and if performed in Italy.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 10 HTA reports and 33 economic evaluations. Among the latter, 20 (60,6%) were cost-effectiveness analyses. Ten studies (23,3%) assessed the vaccination against S. pneumoniae figuring out that it is cost-effectiveness and even costsaving in cases of newborns and subjects at risk. Nine studies (20,9%) addressed influenza vaccination and demonstrated its dominance on non-vaccination in the elderly. Eight studies (18,6%) evaluated the HPV vaccines concluding that they are cost-effective. Five studies (11,6%) devoted to anti-rotavirus vaccination showing its dominance on non-vaccination, in particular from the society perspective. Vaccination against pertussis, hepatitis B, chicken pox, measles, rubella, mumps were eventually shown cost-saving. The vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis was considered potentially cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The Italian scientific evidence on efficiency of vaccination is broad and allows concluding that vaccinations are value for money interventions.","['Di Nardo F', 'Boccalini S', 'Calabrò GE', 'Marcellusi A', 'Ruggeri M', 'Bonanni P', 'Vitali R', 'Capannini E', 'Mennini FS', 'Cicchetti A', 'Panatto D', 'Gasparini R', 'Ricciardi W', 'De Waure C']",2017,73,5,Ig Sanita Pubbl,"Di Nardo F, et al.

29428176,The impact of immunization programs on 10 vaccine preventable diseases in Italy: 1900-2015.,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination has determined a dramatic decline in morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases over the last century. However, low perceived risk of the infectious threat and increased concern about vaccines' safety led to a reduction in vaccine coverage, with increased risk of disease outbreaks.
METHODS: Annual surveillance data of nationally communicable infectious diseases in Italy between 1900 and 2015 were used to derive trends in morbidity and mortality rates before and after vaccine introduction, focusing particularly on the effect of vaccination programs. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were applied to ten vaccine-preventable diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and invasive meningococcal disease. Results of these models referring to data before the immunization programs were projected on the vaccination period to estimate expected cases. The difference between observed and projected cases provided estimates of cases avoided by vaccination.
RESULTS: The temporal trend for each disease started with high incidence rates, followed by a period of persisting reduction. After vaccine introduction, and particularly after the recommendation for universal use among children, the current rates were much lower than those forecasted without vaccination, both in the whole population and among the 0-to-4 year olds, which is, generally, the most susceptible age class. Assuming that the difference between incidence rates before and after vaccination programs was attributable only to vaccine, more than 4 million cases were prevented, and nearly 35% of them among children in the early years of life. Diphtheria was the disease with the highest number of prevented cases, followed by mumps, chickenpox and measles.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal vaccination programs represent the most effective prevention tool against infectious diseases, having a major impact on human health. Health authorities should make any effort to strengthen public confidence in vaccines, highlighting scientific evidence of vaccination benefits.","['Pezzotti P', 'Bellino S', 'Prestinaci F', 'Iacchini S', 'Lucaroni F', 'Camoni L', 'Barbieri MM', 'Ricciardi W', 'Stefanelli P', 'Rezza G']",2018,36,11,Vaccine,"Pezzotti P, et al.

At the beginning of the 20th century, both conditions were known to be related, but the precise relationship was unclear. It was assumed that chickenpox could originate after infection by both a person with shingles or someone with chickenpox, but that both diseases were caused by different viruses. Through rigorous observations in his GP practice and during his field work on the island of Yell, Hope-Simpson developed his hypothesis about the - now scientifically accepted - pathogenesis of shingles. Hope-Simpson's work shows how accurate observations can lead to unexpected new insights and hypotheses.","['Wichers IM', 'Opstelten W']",2018,162,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Wichers IM and Opstelten W.

29422094,Patient's experiences with the care for juvenile idiopathic arthritis across Europe.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the views of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients and their parents on the care and treatment they receive in referral pediatric rheumatology centers throughout Europe.
METHODS: In a collaboration between physicians and patient associations, a questionnaire was developed, covering various domains of JIA care, including demographics, diagnosis, referrals to various health care professionals, access to pain and fatigue management and support groups, information they received about the disease and awareness of and participation in research. The questionnaire was translated and distributed by parent associations and pediatric rheumatologists in 25 countries, 22 of which were European. After completion the replies were entered on the PRINTO website. Replies could either be entered directly by parents on the website or on paper. In these cases, the replies were scanned and emailed by local hospital staff to Utrecht where they were entered by I.R. in the database.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 622 parents in 23 countries. The majority (66.7%) of patients were female, with median age 10-11 years at the completion of the questionnaire. Frequencies of self-reported JIA categories corresponded to literature. Some patients had never been referred to the ophthalmologist (22.8%) or physiotherapist (31.7%). Low rates of referral or access to fatigue (3.5%) or pain management teams (10.0%), age appropriate disease education (11.3%), special rehabilitation (13.7%) and support groups (20.1%) were observed. Many patients indicated they did not have contact details for urgent advice (35.9%) and did not receive information about immunizations (43.2%), research (55.6%) existence of transition of care clinics (89,2%) or financial support (89.7%). While on immunosuppressive drugs, about one half of patients did not receive information about immunizations, travelling, possible infections or how to deal with chickenpox or shingles.
CONCLUSIONS: Low rates of referral to health care professionals may be due to children whose illness is well managed and who do not need additional support or information. Improvements are needed, especially in the areas of supportive care and information patients receive. It is also important to improve doctor patient communication between visits. Physicians can be instrumental in the setting up of support groups and increasing patients' awareness of existing support. Suggestions are given to convey crucial pieces of information structurally and repeatedly to ensure, among other things, compliance.","['van Dijkhuizen EHP', 'Egert T', 'Egert Y', 'Costello W', 'Schoemaker C', 'Fernhout M', 'Kepic M', 'Martini A', 'Scala S', 'Rotstein-Grein I', 'Vastert SJ', 'Wulffraat NM']",2018,16,1,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,"van Dijkhuizen EHP, et al.

29411189,Guillain-Barré syndrome following varicella-zoster virus infection.,"We describe the frequency, clinical features, and electrophysiological and immunological phenotypes of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) patients treated at a single institution in Bangladesh who had preceding chicken pox (primary Varicella-zoster virus [VZV] infection) within 4 weeks of GBS onset. A literature review of GBS cases preceding VZV infection is also provided. Diagnosis of GBS was based on the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria for GBS. Serum anti-VZV IgM and IgG antibodies were quantified by indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA); anti-Campylobacter jejuni IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies and anti-ganglioside GM1 IgM and IgG antibodies, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Neurophysiologic subtypes were categorized following the Hadden criteria. Of 536 patients with GBS, 7 (1.3%) had chicken pox within 4 weeks before GBS onset. Four of the seven cases were male (age range, 23 to 40 years old). All seven patients were bed-bound, six had sensory symptoms, and three required mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. All seven patients had CSF albuminocytologic dissociation and evidence of demyelination in nerve conduction studies. Anti-VZV IgM antibodies were present and anti-GM1 and anti-Campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS) were negative in all cases. All patients had excellent outcome at 1 year (able to run). A systematic literature review of GBS cases related to VZV revealed 39 previously reported patients with comparable clinical presentations and outcomes, of which 36 had neurophysiologic evidence of demyelination. VZV infection is associated with the demyelinating subtype of GBS, clearly distinct from the axonal form of GBS that predominate in countries like Bangladesh.","['Islam B', 'Islam Z', 'GeurtsvanKessel CH', 'Jahan I', 'Endtz HP', 'Mohammad QD', 'Jacobs BC']",2018,37,3,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Islam B, et al.

29388450,"Effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of one vs. two-dose varicella vaccination：a meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Despite high 1-dose vaccination coverage, breakthrough varicella infections still occur. Therefore, 2-dose vaccination is recommended to enhance the immune response to the virus. However, the reported incremental vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 2-dose vaccination varies widely among studies.
METHODS: To determine the overall effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of one vs. two-dose varicella vaccination, we searched five databases for articles published during 1995-2017.
RESULTS: The incremental VE/efficacy of 2-dose vaccination was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56%-90%) in randomized controlled trials，63% (95% CI: 36%-79%) in cohort studies and 81% (95% CI: 65%-90%) in case-control studies. Regarding immunogenicity, the pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) of geometric mean titer (GMT) and the pooled relative risk (RR) of seroconversion for 2-dose vs. 1-dose vaccine were 562.44 (95% CI: 471.78-653.10) and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02-1.04), respectively. Children who received second dose vaccination were at increased risk of grade 3 redness (RR: 4.93, 95% CI: 1.89 - 12.87) and swelling of any intensity (RR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.66).
CONCLUSIONS: Two-dose varicella vaccination resulted in higher levels of immunogenicity and provided superior protection than 1-dose vaccination. Safety profiles showed 2-dose vaccination was well tolerated but the incidence of grade 3 redness and of any intensity was significantly higher.","['Yin M', 'Xu X', 'Liang Y', 'Ni J']",2018,17,4,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Yin M, et al.

29373475,Lessons From an Outbreak of Varicella Infection in Pediatric Hemato-oncology Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised patients exposed to varicella may experience significant morbidity and a 7% mortality rate. Management and outcome of an outbreak of varicella infection among hospitalized pediatric hemato-oncology patients using the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases are presented.
METHODS: This retrospective study describes an outbreak of varicella infection between February 2011 and June 2011. Data were retrieved from the patients' files. Positive polymerase chain reaction results for varicella zoster virus from vesicular skin lesions were used for the diagnosis of varicella infection.
RESULTS: Twelve pediatric hemato-oncology patients experienced 13 episodes of varicella infection, 11 underwent 1 episode each and 1 patient had 2 episodes. All exposed patients without immunity received varicella zoster immune globulins or intravenous immunoglobulin and were isolated as recommended by the guidelines. Infected patients received intravenous acyclovir. One patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at induction chemotherapy died. All the other patients survived.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience in the management of hospitalized immunocompromised patients exposed to varicella was that a positive IgG serology did not confer protection after exposure to varicella infection and thus can not serve as a marker for immunity. Unlike the isolation period sufficient for immunocompetent patients, crusted lesions can be contagious and thus require extended isolation for immunocompromised patients. Patients receiving rituximab are at greater risk of having persistent or recurrent disease. Studies with a larger sample size should be performed to better assess the management of immunocompromized patients exposed to varicella.","['Manistarski M', 'Levin D', 'Dvir R', 'Berger-Achituv S', 'Rosenfeld Keidar H', 'Grisaru-Soen G', 'Carmeli Y', 'Elhasid R']",2018,37,7,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Manistarski M, et al.

29366704,Modeling the impact of combined vaccination programs against varicella and herpes zoster in Norway.,"BACKGROUND: Adoption of varicella immunization in Europe is limited due to a predicted increase in the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) resulting from a removal of exogenous boosting by varicella vaccination. Most available assessments of immunization strategies only considered universal varicella vaccination (alone or in combination with HZ by the live vaccine). The development of a new subunit recombinant zoster vaccine may provide new perspectives of HZ control.
METHODS: We used a mathematical model for VZV in Norway based on the progressive immunity formulation of exogenous boosting. We evaluated a complete range of alternative immunization options against varicella and HZ including both universal and targeted varicella vaccination, either alone or with zoster immunization, and zoster immunization alone. We considered all values of the boosting intensity consistent with the Norwegian HZ incidence and compared the performance of the currently available live vaccine vs. a new recombinant vaccine.
RESULTS: Universal varicella vaccination alone resulted in a marked increase in the incidence of HZ under all scenarios considered. Even under the most favorable hypotheses on the magnitude of the boosting intensity, this increase could be mitigated only by a parallel HZ immunization with a recombinant vaccine, assuming a long duration of protection. Targeted varicella immunization of adolescents resulted in a modest increase in the HZ incidence which could be counterbalanced by both the live and, especially, the recombinant vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: Given current knowledge on HZ pathogenesis and exogenous boosting, targeted varicella vaccination of adolescents was the only strategy that was not predicted to impact the epidemiology of HZ, and therefore it may represent a suitable alternative to universal vaccination. These results are aimed to support vaccine policy decisions in Norway and other countries with a similar VZV epidemiology.","['Marchetti S', 'Guzzetta G', 'Flem E', 'Mirinaviciute G', 'Scalia Tomba G', 'Manfredi P']",2018,36,8,Vaccine,"Marchetti S, et al.

The vaccine has been shown to substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the virus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic burden associated with varicella in Argentina prior to vaccine introduction.
METHODS: This was a multi-center, retrospective chart review study among patients aged 1-12 years with a primary varicella diagnosis in 2009-2014 in Argentina. Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) associated with varicella and its complications, unit costs, and work loss were used to estimate direct and indirect costs. All costs are presented in 2015 United States dollars (USD).
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty children with varicella were included (75 outpatients, 75 inpatients), with a mean age of 3.8 (SD = 2.4) and 2.9 (SD = 2.2) years, respectively. One or more complications were experienced by 28.0% of outpatients and 98.7% of inpatients, the most common being skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, sepsis, cerebellitis, and febrile seizure. HCRU estimates included use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications (58.7% outpatients, 94.7% inpatients), prescription medications (26.7% outpatients, 77.3% inpatients), tests/procedures (13.3% outpatients, 70.7% inpatients), and consultation with allied health professionals (1.3% outpatients, 32.0% inpatients). The average duration of hospital stay was 4.9 (95% CI = 4.2-5.7) days, and the average duration of ICU stay was 4.8 (95% CI = 1.6-14.1) days. The total combined direct and indirect cost per varicella case was 2947.7 USD (inpatients) and 322.7 USD (outpatients). The overall annual cost of varicella in Argentina for children aged ≤14 years in 2015 was estimated at 40,054,378.0 USD.
CONCLUSION: The clinical burden of varicella in Argentina was associated with utilization of significant amounts of healthcare resources, resulting in substantial economic costs.

METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted among 200 pregnant women with ≥12 gestation weeks to test two interventions, including a messaging video and a messaging booklet. The participants were randomly assigned into the control group, the video group or the booklet group. The VarV coverage at 12 and 24 months old was compared among the children of the three groups and relative risks (RRs) were calculated, by using the coverage of the control group as reference. The timeliness of VarV was also assessed. Furthermore, differences in the effects on the knowledge and attitude of VarV vaccination between the two interventions was evaluated.
RESULTS: The VarV coverage of their children by 24 months of age was 86.4%, 76.1% and 56.7% for the video group, the booklet group and the control group, respectively. The relative risks (RRs) for the coverage of VarV at 24 months of age were 4.8 (95% CI: 2.06-11.3) for the video group and 2.4 (95% CI: 1.2-5.1) for the booklet group. The means of delays were 57.3 days in the video group, 76.9 days in the booklet group, and 100.6 days in the control group. The proportion of women who intended to vaccinate their children with VarV was higher in the video group than the booklet group (93.9% vs. 82.1%, p < 0.05).

29316913,Influence of demographic changes on the impact of vaccination against varicella and herpes zoster in Germany - a mathematical modelling study.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest that reduced exposure to varicella might lead to an increased risk for herpes zoster (HZ). Reduction of exposure to varicella is a consequence of varicella vaccination but also of demographic changes. We analyzed how the combination of vaccination programs and demographic dynamics will affect the epidemiology of varicella and HZ in Germany over the next 50 years.
METHODS: We used a deterministic dynamic compartmental model to assess the impact of different varicella and HZ vaccination strategies on varicella and HZ epidemiology in three demographic scenarios, namely the projected population for Germany, the projected population additionally accounting for increased immigration as observed in 2015/2016, and a stationary population.
RESULTS: Projected demographic changes alone result in an increase of annual HZ cases by 18.3% and a decrease of varicella cases by 45.7% between 1990 and 2060. Independently of the demographic scenario, varicella vaccination reduces the cumulative number of varicella cases until 2060 by approximately 70%, but also increases HZ cases by 10%. Unlike the currently licensed live attenuated HZ vaccine, the new subunit vaccine candidate might completely counteract this effect. Relative vaccine effects were consistent across all demographic scenarios.
CONCLUSION: Demographic dynamics will be a major determinant of HZ epidemiology in the next 50 years. While stationary population models are appropriate for assessing vaccination impact, models incorporating realistic population structures allow a direct comparison to surveillance data and can thus provide additional input for immunization decision-making and resource planning.","['Horn J', 'Damm O', 'Greiner W', 'Hengel H', 'Kretzschmar ME', 'Siedler A', 'Ultsch B', 'Weidemann F', 'Wichmann O', 'Karch A', 'Mikolajczyk RT']",2018,16,1,BMC Med,"Horn J, et al.

29307566,Post-varicella Arterial Ischemic Stroke in Denmark 2010 to 2016.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella, most often a benign disease of childhood, is associated with an increased risk of arterial ischemic stroke in children. The aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke in the Danish child population and describe clinical characteristics of children admitted with post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke.
METHODS: In the Danish National Patient Register, we identified inpatients 28 days to 16 years of age with a discharge diagnosis of stroke or cerebrovascular disease from 2010 to 2016. Medical files were reviewed, and children with arterial ischemic stroke and varicella infection less than 12 months before onset of symptoms were included.
RESULTS: We identified 15 children with arterial ischemic stroke and varicella less than 12 months before. In nine children, the diagnosis was confirmed by detection of varicella zoster virus DNA or varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin G in the cerebrospinal fluid. All children were previously healthy, the mean age was four years, and 67% were male. The median time from varicella rash to arterial ischemic stroke was 4.6 months. The most common location of arterial ischemic stroke was the basal ganglia, and affected vessels were most often in the anterior circulation. Fifty-three percent experienced neurological sequelae of varying degree.
CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, where varicella vaccination is not part of the childhood vaccination program, the estimated risk of post-varicella arterial ischemic stroke was one case (including possible cases) per 26,000 children with varicella.","['Helmuth IG', 'Mølbak K', 'Uldall PV', 'Poulsen A']",2018,80,,Pediatr Neurol,"Helmuth IG, et al.

29306654,Humoral immune response to measles and varicella vaccination in former very low birth weight preterm infants.,"INTRODUCTION: Immune response to vaccination in infants born prematurely may be lower than in infants born at full-term. Some clinical factors might be associated with humoral immune response.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to compare the immune response to measles and varicella vaccination in infants born prematurely with those born at full-term and to analyze factors associated with measles and varicella antibody levels.
METHODS: Prospective study including two groups of infants aged 12 months. One group of infants born prematurely with birth-weight <1500g and who were in follow-up at the outpatient clinic for preterm infants at the institution and other group of infants born at full-term. Infants with malformations, primary immunodeficiency diseases, born to HIV-positive mothers or who had received plasma or immunoglobulin transfusions five months before or three weeks after vaccination were excluded. Plasma antibodies were measured by ELISA and factors associated with antibody levels were assessed by linear regression.
RESULTS: Sixty-five premature and 56 full-term infants were included. The percentage of immune individuals after vaccination against measles (100% vs. 100%) and varicella (92.5% vs. 93.2%) were similar in both groups, as well as the antibody levels against measles (2.393 vs. 2.412UI/mL; p=0.970) and varicella (0.551 vs. 0.399UI/mL; p=0.114). Use of antenatal corticosteroids decreased measles antibody levels whereas breastfeeding for more than six months increased varicella antibody levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Humoral responses to measles and varicella were similar between infants born prematurely and full-term infants. Measles antibody levels were negatively associated with antenatal corticosteroid use; varicella antibodies were positively associated with prolonged breastfeeding.","['Ferreira CSM', 'Perin MCAA', 'Moraes-Pinto MI', 'Simão-Gurge RM', 'Goulart AL', 'Weckx LY', 'Dos Santos AMN']",2018,22,1,Braz J Infect Dis,"Ferreira CSM, et al.

29291045,Cost-effectiveness of Varicella Vaccination Program in Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus is the etiologic agent of primary varicella (chickenpox) during childhood, and varicella vaccination has not been introduced in Iran. The aim of this study is to estimate cost-effectiveness of one- and two-dose Varicella Vaccination Program in Iran.
METHODS: A decision-tree model was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Varicella Vaccination Program in a cohort of 12 months children in Iran. Epidemiologic parameters of varicella were extracted from local and international sources, and cost of disease was estimated based on societal prospective in 2015 US$. Incremental cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted calculated as final outcome. Sensitivity analysis was also performed for lower and upper estimate of incidence, DALY, and vaccine efficacy.
RESULTS: Considering the vaccine efficacy of 95%, for the two-dose and 85% for the one-dose vaccination, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per DALYs averted were US$41,531 and US$17,280, respectively. ICER has changed between (US$ 6,177-US$167,047) in lower and upper base estimate of epidemiological burden parameters in sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella vaccination is not cost-effective in Iran in one-dose and two-dose scenario under the assumptions of this study in base case scenario according to the threshold of incremental cost per DALY averted less than three time of GDP per capita in Iran = US$ 14,292.

The CIDARS plays an important role in and has been integrated into the routine outbreak monitoring efforts of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) at all levels in China. In the CIDARS, thresholds are determined using the ""Mean+2SD‟ in the early stage which have limitations. This study compared the performance of optimized thresholds defined using the ""Mean +2SD‟ method to the performance of 5 novel algorithms to select optimal ""Outbreak Gold Standard (OGS)‟ and corresponding thresholds for outbreak detection. Data for infectious disease were organized by calendar week and year. The ""Mean+2SD‟, C1, C2, moving average (MA), seasonal model (SM), and cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithms were applied. Outbreak signals for the predicted value (Px) were calculated using a percentile-based moving window. When the outbreak signals generated by an algorithm were in line with a Px generated outbreak signal for each week, this Px was then defined as the optimized threshold for that algorithm. In this study, six infectious diseases were selected and classified into TYPE A (chickenpox and mumps), TYPE B (influenza and rubella) and TYPE C [hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and scarlet fever].

29254392,Varicella epidemiology in Latin America and the Caribbean.,"INTRODUCTION: The Latin American Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (SLIPE), with the support of the Americas Health Foundation (AHF), has developed a position paper on varicella prevention in Latin America and Caribbean countries (LAC). This article summarizes the most relevant aspects of varicella in LAC, and emphasizes the need to include the varicella vaccine in the national immunization programs in the Region and evaluate its impact disease burden.
AREAS COVERED: A systematic review was conducted of the medical evidence published and presented at various regional medical conferences on the disease burden in LAC, the advances made by prevention programs, the available vaccines in the Region, and their immunogenicity, efficacy, effectiveness, and safety. The different national varicella-prevention vaccination programs were reviewed, as was available information regarding the impact of these programs on the epidemiology of varicella in those countries implementing a varicella vaccine strategy. Following that initial publication, an update was conducted, including data from additional countries in the Region.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Varicella is a vaccine-preventable infectious disease, considered a 'benign disease' because of lower complication rates when compared with measles, pertussis. The incorporation of a two-dose varicella vaccine in national immunization schedules in all countries throughout LAC would be of great benefit to the health of the children.","['Ávila-Agüero ML', 'Beltrán S', 'Castillo JBD', 'Castillo Díaz ME', 'Chaparro LE', 'Deseda C', 'Debbag R', 'Espinal C', 'Falleiros-Arlant LH', 'González Mata AJ', 'Macías Parra M', 'Marques-Rosa F', 'Catalina Pírez M', 'Vázquez-Rivera M']",2018,17,2,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Ávila-Agüero ML, et al.

29249544,Single-dose varicella vaccine effectiveness in Brazil: A case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella vaccine was introduced into the Brazilian Immunization Program in October 2013, as a single-dose schedule administered at 15 months of age. Its effectiveness had not yet been assessed in the country.
METHODS: A matched case-control study was carried out in São Paulo and Goiânia (Southeast and Midwest regions, respectively), Brazil. Suspected cases, were identified through a prospective surveillance established in the study sites. All cases had specimens from skin lesion collected for molecular laboratory testing. Cases were confirmed by either clinical or PCR of skin lesions and classified as mild, moderate, and severe disease. Two neighborhood controls were selected for each case. Cases and controls were aged 15-32 months and interviewed at home. Evidence of prior vaccination was obtained from vaccination cards. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used, and odds ratio and its respective 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated by comparing de odds of having received varicella vaccine among cases and controls.
RESULTS: A total of 168 cases and 301 controls were enrolled. Moderate and severe illness, was found in 33.3% and 9.9% of the cases. Effectiveness of a single dose varicella vaccine was 86% (95%CI 72-92%) against disease of any severity and 93% (95%CI 82-97%) against moderate and severe disease. Out of 168 cases, 81.8% had positive PCR results for wild-type strains, and 22.0% were breakthrough varicella cases. Breakthrough cases were milder compared to non-breakthrough cases (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of single dose varicella vaccine in Brazil is comparable to that in other countries where breakthrough varicella cases have also been found to occur. The goal of the varicella vaccination program, along with disease burden and affordability should be taken into consideration when considering the adoption of a second dose of varicella vaccine into national immunization programs.","['Andrade AL', 'da Silva Vieira MA', 'Minamisava R', 'Toscano CM', 'de Lima Souza MB', 'Fiaccadori F', 'Figueiredo CA', 'Curti SP', 'Nerger MLBR', 'Bierrenbach AL', 'Varicella Study Group']",2018,36,4,Vaccine,"Andrade AL, et al.

Comparative genomic sequence analysis of clinical and vaccine strains suggested potential sites responsible for attenuation. In this study, low and high passages of two VZV clinical strains cultured in human fibroblast cells were compared for genomic DNA sequences and growth characteristics. Mutations were detected at 187 and 162 sites in the strain YC01 and YC02, respectively. More than 86% of mutations were found in open reading frames, and ORF62 exhibited highest frequency of mutations. T to C and A to G transitions accounted for more 90% of all possible substitutions. Forty mutations were common to two strains, including 27 in ORF62. Mutations found in attenuated vaccine strains were also detected at 7 positions. Both high and low passage strains were infectious and grew similarly in human fibroblast cells. In guinea pig cells, however, high passage strain remained infectious while low passage strain lost infectivity. This study may provide new insight into the attenuating mutations associated with in vitro passaging of VZV.","['Kim SC', 'Won YH', 'Park JS', 'Jeon JS', 'Ahn JH', 'Song MJ', 'Shin OS', 'Lee CH']",2018,245,,Virus Res,"Kim SC, et al.

29224964,"One or two doses of live varicella virus-containing vaccines: Efficacy, persistence of immune responses, and safety six years after administration in healthy children during their second year of life.","BACKGROUND: This phase III B follow-up of an initial multicenter study (NCT00226499) will evaluate the ten-year efficacy of two doses of the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMRV) and one dose of the live attenuated varicella vaccine (V) versus a measles-mumps-rubella control group (MMR) for the prevention of clinical varicella disease. Here we present efficacy results for six years post-vaccination.
METHODS: In phase A of the study, healthy children aged 12-22 months from ten European countries were randomized (3:3:1) and received either two doses of MMRV, or one dose of combined MMR and one dose of monovalent varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or two doses of the MMR vaccine (control), 42 days apart. Vaccine efficacy against all and against moderate or severe varicella (confirmed by detection of viral DNA or epidemiological link) was assessed from six weeks up to six years post-dose 2 for the MMRV and MMR+V groups, and was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The severity of varicella was calculated using the modified Vázquez scale (mild ≤ 7; moderately severe = 8-15; severe ≥ 16). Herpes zoster cases were also recorded.
RESULTS: 5289 children (MMRV = 2279, mean age = 14.2, standard deviation [SD] = 2.5; MMR+V = 2266, mean age = 14.2, SD = 2.4; MMR = 744, mean age = 14.2, SD = 2.5 months) were included in the efficacy cohort. 815 varicella cases were confirmed. Efficacy of two doses of MMRV against all and against moderate or severe varicella was 95.0% (95% CI: 93.6-96.2) and 99.0% (95% CI: 97.7-99.6), respectively. Efficacy of one dose of varicella vaccine against all and against moderate or severe varicella was 67.0% (95% CI: 61.8-71.4) and 90.3% (95% CI: 86.9-92.8), respectively. There were four confirmed herpes zoster cases (MMR+V = 2, MMR = 2), all were mild and three tested positive for the wild-type virus.

29219259,Nursing management of childhood chickenpox infection.,"Chickenpox is an extremely contagious infectious disease caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV). It is a common childhood illness characterised by an itchy vesicular rash and fever, which usually resolves spontaneously without medical intervention. Serious, and rarely fatal, complications can occur, including pneumonia, central nervous system infection, overwhelming secondary bacterial infections, especially with Group A streptococcus, and necrotising fasciitis. Therefore it is crucial that emergency department (ED) nurses can recognise the signs and symptoms that indicate deterioration. This article reviews best practice management of children with chickenpox, gives up-to-date guidance on the safe use of antipyretics, the avoidance of ibuprofen and discusses immunisation against VZV. It also includes implications for nursing practice and a case study that illustrates some of the challenges that ED nurses may encounter.","['Boyd G', 'Heaton PA', 'Wilkinson R', 'Paul SP']",2017,25,8,Emerg Nurse,"Boyd G, et al.

29208790,Oral Manifestation in Patients diagnosed with Dermatological Diseases.,"AIM: This study aimed to estimate the frequency of oral lesions in dermatological diseased patients attending the outpatient department of Pravara Rural Medical and Dental College and Hospital, Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences (Deemed University), Loni, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India, and the Department of Dermatology at Medical College, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted in Loni from October 2013 to January 2014. A total of 310 patients (mean age 37.2 ± 16 years, 61.2% males) completed an oral examination and a personal interview. Oral lesions were recorded. Biopsy and smear were used as adjuvant techniques for confirmation. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 15.0.1).
RESULTS: Of 310 cases (n = 310) observed for skin lesions, 99 cases were psoriasis (31.93%) and 68 cases were lichen planus (LP; 21.9%), followed by herpes zoster in 44 cases (14.1%), herpes simplex in 13 cases (4.1%), pemphigus vulgaris (PV) in 15 cases (4.8%), erythema multiforme (EM) in 8 cases (2.5%), bullous pemphigoid (BP) in 4 cases (1.2%), chicken pox in 3 cases (0.9%), eczema in 52 cases (16.7%), and nutritional deficiency and candidiasis in 2 cases (Table 1).
CONCLUSION: The dermatologic diseases studied frequently occur in the oral cavity. Among them, psoriasis was the most common dermatological disease, and LP frequently showed.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study also depicts that diagnosis and management of these oral lesions should also be carried out by oral clinicians so as to improve the oral health functioning during the course of the disease. The intraoral examination should be incorporated to the routine of dermatologic assistance as the oral manifestations can represent preliminary signs or can coexist with the diseases.","['Thete SG', 'Kulkarni M', 'Nikam AP', 'Mantri T', 'Umbare D', 'Satdive S', 'Kulkarni D']",2017,18,12,J Contemp Dent Pract,"Thete SG, et al.

We studied the intention of parents to have their child vaccinated against four diseases not currently covered by the NIP in the Netherlands. The results on varicella have been published before; this article adds the results on vaccination against rotavirus gastroenteritis, meningococcal B disease, and seasonal influenza.
RESULTS: We invited a random sample from the national immunisation register of 1500 parents for an internet survey which was completed by 491 parents (33% response). The intention to vaccinate was highest for meningococcal B disease (83% positive intention), followed by rotavirus gastroenteritis (38%), and lowest for varicella (28%) and seasonal influenza (15%). Prediction analyses were performed to determine which out of seven questionnaire statements was most informative in predicting the intention to vaccinate. Main drivers of intention were the perceived importance of vaccination against the particular disease and the perception of whether or not the disease is severe enough to justify vaccination. The results of this study can be informative in the decision-making process whether or not to introduce new vaccines into the NIP.","['van Lier A', 'Ferreira JA', 'Mollema L', 'Sanders EAM', 'de Melker HE']",2017,10,1,BMC Res Notes,"van Lier A, et al.

29198917,Early impact of universal varicella vaccination on childhood varicella and herpes zoster hospitalizations in Brazil.,"INTRODUCTION: The Brazilian childhood National Immunization Program (NIP) introduced live and attenuated varicella vaccination in a single dose, combined as tetraviral vaccine, at 15 months of age in the whole country, during September to December of 2013. The aim of this study was to report trends in incidence of childhood hospital admissions related to varicella and zoster in Brazil from 2003 to 2016, including the first three years after vaccine introduction.
METHODS: The number and incidence of hospital admission in patients aged less than 20 years in Brazilian public health system with an admission diagnosis of varicella and zoster from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed and pre (2003-2013) and post-vaccination periods (2014-2016) were compared. The data were obtained from DATASUS, a Brazilian government's open-access public health database system, and analyzed adjusting for secular trend and seasonality if a statistically significant change was found.
RESULTS: During the study period, 69,791 admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster occurred in the children younger than 20 years. After adjusting for seasonality, the incidence of hospitalizations decreased from 27.33 to 14.33 per 100000 per year, which corresponds to a reduction of 47.6% (95% confidence interval 18.19-77.04%, p < 0.001) in the vaccinated age group (1-4 years) in 2014-2016 compared to pre-vaccination period. The changes were not significant in the unvaccinated age groups.
CONCLUSION: The hospitalizations due to varicella and herpes zoster were decreased by half early after the introduction of a single dose of tetraviral vaccine in NIP in the vaccinated children. Further studies may assess duration and intensity of this effect, as well as the indirect effect in the unvaccinated age groups.","['Scotta MC', 'Paternina-de la Ossa R', 'Lumertz MS', 'Jones MH', 'Mattiello R', 'Pinto LA']",2018,36,2,Vaccine,"Scotta MC, et al.

29196796,Increased herpes zoster risk associated with poor HLA-A immediate early 62 protein (IE62) affinity.,"Around 30% of individuals will develop herpes zoster (HZ), caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), during their life. While several risk factors for HZ, such as immunosuppressive therapy, are well known, the genetic and molecular components that determine the risk of otherwise healthy individuals to develop HZ are still poorly understood. We created a computational model for the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA-A, -B, and -C) presentation capacity of peptides derived from the VZV Immediate Early 62 (IE62) protein. This model could then be applied to a HZ cohort with known HLA molecules. We found that HLA-A molecules with poor VZV IE62 presentation capabilities were more common in a cohort of 50 individuals with a history of HZ compared to a nationwide control group, which equated to a HZ risk increase of 60%. This tendency was most pronounced for cases of HZ at a young age, where other risk factors are less prevalent. These findings provide new molecular insights into the development of HZ and reveal a genetic predisposition in those individuals most at risk to develop HZ.","['Meysman P', 'De Neuter N', 'Bartholomeus E', 'Elias G', 'Van den Bergh J', 'Emonds MP', 'Haasnoot GW', 'Heynderickx S', 'Wens J', 'Michels NR', 'Lambert J', 'Lion E', 'Claas FHJ', 'Goossens H', 'Smits E', 'Van Damme P', 'Van Tendeloo V', 'Beutels P', 'Suls A', 'Mortier G', 'Laukens K', 'Ogunjimi B']",2018,70,6,Immunogenetics,"Meysman P, et al.

These vaccine preventable diseases are common globally. Most available data on VZV epidemiology are from industrialised temperate countries and cannot be used to guide decisions on the immunization policy against VZV in Africa. This systematic review aims to review the published data on VZV morbidity and mortality in Africa.
METHODS: All published studies conducted in Africa from 1974 to 2015 were eligible. Eligible studies must have reported any VZV epidemiological measure (incidence, prevalence, hospitalization rate and mortality rate). For inclusion in the review, studies must have used a defined VZV case definition, be it clinical or laboratory-based.
RESULTS: Twenty articles from 13 African countries were included in the review. Most included studies were cross-sectional, conducted on hospitalized patients, and half of the studies used varying serological methods for diagnosis. VZV seroprevalence was very high among adults. Limited data on VZV seroprevalence in children showed very low seropositivity to anti-VZV antibodies. Co-morbidity with VZV was common.
CONCLUSION: There is lack of quality data that could be used to develop VZV control programmes, including vaccination, in Africa.

29116592,Varicella-zoster virus ORF7 interacts with ORF53 and plays a role in its trans-Golgi network localization.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that causes chickenpox and shingles. ORF7 is an important virulence determinant of VZV in both human skin and nerve tissues, however, its specific function and involved molecular mechanism in VZV pathogenesis remain largely elusive. Previous yeast two-hybrid studies on intraviral protein-protein interaction network in herpesviruses have revealed that VZV ORF7 may interact with ORF53, which is a virtually unstudied but essential viral protein. The aim of this study is to identify and characterize VZV ORF53, and to investigate its relationship with ORF7. For this purpose, we prepared monoclonal antibodies against ORF53 and, for the first time, characterized it as a ~40 kDa viral protein predominantly localizing to the trans-Golgi network of the infected host cell. Next, we further confirmed the interaction between ORF7 and ORF53 by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies in both plasmid-transfected and VZV-infected cells. Moreover, interestingly, we found that ORF53 lost its trans-Golgi network localization and became dispersed in the cytoplasm of host cells infected with an ORF7-deleted recombinant VZV, and thus ORF7 seems to play a role in normal subcellular localization of ORF53. Collectively, these results suggested that ORF7 and ORF53 may function as a complex during infection, which may be implicated in VZV pathogenesis.","['Wang W', 'Fu W', 'Pan D', 'Cai L', 'Ye J', 'Liu J', 'Liu C', 'Que Y', 'Xia N', 'Zhu H', 'Cheng T']",2017,32,5,Virol Sin,"Wang W, et al.

29107654,"Effectiveness of varicella vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis during a varicella outbreak in Shanghai, China.","OBJECTIVES: Varicella vaccine (VarV) is recommended as effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) within 3-5days to control outbreaks. However, the effectiveness of PEP at >5days after exposure and the administration of a second dose to those with a history of one dose prior to exposure have not been fully examined. This study evaluated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of PEP in preventing disease during a varicella outbreak in Shanghai, China in 2013.
METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were used to obtain the students' varicella history, vaccination status, and willingness to receive PEP. One dose of VarV was provided free of charge to eligible students. The VE of PEP was calculated as [1-relative risk (RR)]×100%. Analyses were restricted to grade 8 students, as no students from the other grades or teachers developed varicella during the outbreak.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven varicella cases were identified, 16 (59%) of which were infected after the PEP campaign. Sixty-five students received one dose of VarV on day 13 or 19 after the index case. Attack rates were 28% (9/32), 16% (15/94), 0% (0/10), and 6% (3/55) among unvaccinated, one-dose Pre-PEP, first dose as PEP, and second dose as PEP recipients, respectively. Cases among second dose as PEP recipients tended to have less fever compared with unvaccinated or one-dose Pre-PEP recipients. Compared with unvaccinated students, the VE of first dose as PEP recipients was 100% and of the second dose as PEP recipients was 60% (95% confidence interval -72% to 91%).
CONCLUSIONS: Post-exposure vaccination should be given as soon as possible after exposure. Nevertheless, vaccination is still recommended even at more than 5days post-exposure to control varicella outbreaks.","['Wu QS', 'Liu JY', 'Wang X', 'Chen YF', 'Zhou Q', 'Wu AQ', 'Wang L']",2018,66,,Int J Infect Dis,"Wu QS, et al.

29070705,How to hold an ethical pox party.,"Pox parties are a controversial alternative to vaccination for diseases such as chickenpox. Such parties involve parents infecting non-immune children by exposing them to a contagious child. If successful, infection will usually lead to immunity, thus preventing infection later in life, which, for several vaccine-preventable diseases, is more severe than childhood infection. Some may consider pox parties more morally objectionable than opting out of vaccination through non-medical exemptions. In this paper, I argue that this is not the case. Pox parties involve immediate risk of harm for children and reduce future harms, whereas opting out of vaccination places children at long-term risk of harms that increase with time, at least for some pathogens. Regarding harm to others through onward transmission of infection, this can be easily prevented in the case of pox parties-given the relatively controlled timing of infection-by quarantining attendees after the party, whereas opting out of vaccination involves risks to others that are more difficult to control. I defend three criteria for an ethical pox party: (1) that the disease is sufficiently low risk, (2) that parents consent to their child's attendance and (3) that children exposed to infection are quarantined and isolated appropriately. I argue that, if these criteria are met, pox parties are morally preferable to non-vaccination; such parties involve less risk to non-consenting others and, for some pathogens in some cases, even involve less risk for the children who participate. Thus, policies that permit non-medical exemption to vaccination should also permit ethical pox parties. Alternatively, if pox parties are not permitted, then vaccination should be mandated for those without medical contraindication.",['Jamrozik E'],2018,44,4,J Med Ethics,Jamrozik E.

29050801,Projections of zoster incidence in Australia based on demographic and transmission models of varicella-zoster virus infection.,"Re-exposure to varicella infection is believed to delay the occurrence of herpes zoster (HZ), which has led to predictions of increased HZ following introduction of varicella vaccination programs. However, there is evidence of rising HZ rates before vaccination was introduced. Here, we explore a potential explanation for this effect through demographic change leading to reductions in varicella exposure and boosting in the context of Australia over the 20th century. To study this hypothesis, we integrated observed changes in Australian birth and age-specific death rates with a varicella transmission model. The model was then calibrated to age-specific pre-vaccination seroprevalence (1997-9) and hospitalization data (1993-2009). Model simulations predicted that declining birth rates led to a 50% reduction in varicella incidence over the 20th century. When combined with the impacts of an aging population, the simulations further suggested that HZ incidence should have increased by 50% over the 20th century. However, we found that after age-standardization, the residual increase in HZ due to reduced boosting was only about 8% over the 20th century. Results were also sensitive to the assumed duration of immunity to HZ and whether multiple HZ episodes were possible. Despite a strong predicted effect of demographic change on varicella incidence, our findings suggest that improved survival is the main contributor to any rise in HZ rates prior to vaccination in Australia. Removing survival effects through age-standardization is recommended when considering epidemiologic or model-based analysis of past trends in HZ.","['Costantino V', 'Gidding HF', 'Wood JG']",2017,35,48 Pt B,Vaccine,"Costantino V, et al.

29046461,Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Neurons Are Highly Permissive for Varicella-Zoster Virus Lytic Infection.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is highly cell associated when grown in culture and has a much higher (4,000- to 20,000-fold increased) particle-to-PFU ratio in vitro than herpes simplex virus (HSV). In contrast, VZV is highly infectious in vivo by airborne transmission. Neurons are major targets for VZV in vivo; in neurons, the virus can establish latency and reactivate to produce infectious virus. Using neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and cell-free wild-type (WT) VZV, we demonstrated that neurons are nearly 100 times more permissive for WT VZV infection than very-early-passage human embryonic lung cells or MRC-5 diploid human fibroblasts, the cells used for vaccine production or virus isolation. The peak titers achieved after infection were ∼10-fold higher in human neurons than in MRC-5 cells, and the viral genome copy number-to-PFU ratio for VZV in human neurons was 500, compared with 50,000 for MRC-5 cells. Thus, VZV may not necessarily have a higher particle-to-PFU ratio than other herpesviruses; instead, the cells previously used to propagate virus in vitro may have been suboptimal. Furthermore, based on electron microscopy, neurons infected with VZV produced fewer defective or incomplete viral particles than MRC-5 cells. Our data suggest that neurons derived from hESC may have advantages compared to other cells for studies of VZV pathogenesis, for obtaining stocks of virus with high titers, and for isolating VZV from clinical specimens.IMPORTANCE Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. Cell-free VZV has been difficult to obtain, both for in vitro studies and for vaccine production. While numerous cells lines have been tested for their ability to produce high titers of VZV, the number of total virus particles relative to the number of viral particles that can form plaques in culture has been reported to be extremely high relative to that in other viruses. We show that VZV grows to much higher titers in human neurons than in other cell types in vitro and that the number of total virus genomes relative to the number of viral particles that can form plaques in culture is much lower in human neurons than other cultured cells. These findings indicate that human neurons may be useful for studying VZV in vitro, for growing preparations of virus with high titers, and for isolating the virus from human samples.","['Sadaoka T', 'Schwartz CL', 'Rajbhandari L', 'Venkatesan A', 'Cohen JI']",2018,92,1,J Virol,"Sadaoka T, et al.

Areas covered: This review summarises the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors and clinical features of varicella infection. It describes the current and possible future management strategies for preventing varicella infection and reactivation and for treating PHN. Expert opinion: A highly successful Varicella Zoster (VZV) vaccine has not been universally adopted due to fears that it may increase Herpes Zoster (HZ) incidence - and thus PHN - in older, unvaccinated generations. This is a controversial theory but advances in the efficacy of vaccines against HZ may allay these fears and encourage more widespread adoption of the VZV vaccine. Treatment of PHN, as for any neuropathic pain, must be multidisciplinary and multimodal. Advances in sensory phenotyping technology and genomics may allow more individualised treatment. Traditional research methodologies are ill-suited to assess the kind of complex interventions that are necessary to achieve better clinical outcomes in this challenging field.","['Schutzer-Weissmann J', 'Farquhar-Smith P']",2017,18,16,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Schutzer-Weissmann J and Farquhar-Smith P.

28958813,CHRONOVAC VOYAGEUR: A study of the immune response to yellow fever vaccine among infants previously immunized against measles.,"UNLABELLED: For administration of multiple live attenuated vaccines, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends either simultaneous immunization or period of at least 28days between vaccines, due to a possible reduction in the immune response to either vaccine. The main objective of this study was to compare the immune response to measles (alone or combined with mumps and rubella) and yellow fever vaccines among infants aged 6-24months living in a yellow fever non-endemic country who had receivedmeasles and yellow fever vaccines before travelling to a yellow fever endemic area.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter case-control study was carried out in 7 travel clinics in the Paris area from February 1st 2011 to march 31, 2015. Cases were defined as infants immunized with the yellow fever vaccine and with the measles vaccine, either alone or in combination with mumps and rubella vaccine, with a period of 1-27days between each immunization. For each case, two controls were matched based on sex and age: a first control group (control 1) was defined as infants having received the measles vaccine and the yellow fever vaccine simultaneously; a second control group (control 2) was defined as infants who had a period of more than 27days between receiving the measles vaccine and yellow fever vaccine. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage of infants with protective immunity against yellow fever, measured by the titer of neutralizing antibodies in a venous blood sample.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one infants were included in the study (62 cases, 50 infants in control 1 and 19 infants in control 2). Of these, 127 (96%) were shown to have a protective titer of yellow fever antibodies. All 4 infants without a protective titer of yellow fever antibodies were part of control group 1.
DISCUSSION: The measles vaccine, alone or combined with mumps and rubella vaccines, appears to have no influence on humoral immune response to the yellow fever vaccine when administered between 1 and 27days. The absence of protective antibodies against yellow fever was observed only among infants who received both vaccines simultaneously.
CONCLUSION: These results may support a revision of current vaccination recommendations concerning the administration of these two live attenuated vaccines either on the same day or at least 28days apart. Our findings show no statistically significant difference if the interval between both vaccines is more than 24 h, but the immune response seems to be reduced when the two vaccines are given at the same time.","['Goujon C', 'Gougeon ML', 'Tondeur L', 'Poirier B', 'Seffer V', 'Desprès P', 'Consigny PH', 'Vray M', 'study group']",2017,35,45,Vaccine,"Goujon C, et al.

We hypothesise that use of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) as an HIV delivery vector could generate sustained and robust tissue-based immunity against HIV antigens to provide long-term protection against HIV. Given that HIV uniquely targets immune-activated T cells, the development of human vaccines against HIV must also involve a specific examination of the safety of the vector. Thus, we aim to evaluate the effects of VZV vaccination on the recipients' immune activation state, and on VZV-specific circulating humoral and cellular responses in addition to those at the cervical and rectal mucosa.

We performed a meta-analysis to understand whether 2 varicella vaccine doses are needed in children and, if so, to determine the best time to vaccinate.
METHODS: The BV incidence rates after 1 or 2 doses of varicella vaccine were pooled using random effects, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the risk factors after vaccination.
RESULTS: A total of 27 original articles were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled average BV incidence rate in children vaccinated with 1 dose was 8.5 cases per 1,000 person years (PY) (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3-13.7; random effects model) and 2.2 cases per 1,000 PY (95% CI, 0.5-9.3; random effects model) in children vaccinated with 2 doses. The pooled trend of the annual BV incidence rate from the first to eighth year fluctuated, with a peak annual incidence rate of 35.3 cases per 1,000 population in the fourth year. The meta-regression showed that design type, type of vaccine, and their interaction accounted for approximately 71.74% of the heterogeneity in the average BV incidence rate after 1 vaccine dose.

28927384,Heterogeneity in coverage for measles and varicella vaccination in toddlers - analysis of factors influencing parental acceptance.,"BACKGROUND: In 2004, routine varicella vaccination was introduced in Germany for children aged 11-14 months. Routine measles vaccination had already been introduced in 1973 for the same age group, but coverage is still too low (<95%) in some areas to eliminate measles. The present study assessed varicella and measles vaccination coverage and determinants of parental acceptance in two study regions, situated in Northern and Southern Bavaria (Germany).
METHODS: From 2009 to 2011, annual cross-sectional parent surveys were performed on random samples of 600 children aged 18-36 months in the Bavarian regions of both Munich and Würzburg. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with varicella and measles vaccination.
RESULTS: In 2009, 2010 and 2011, vaccination coverage was lower in Munich than in Würzburg, for both varicella (Munich 53%, 67%, 69% vs. Würzburg 72%, 81%, 83%) and for measles (Munich 88%, 89%, 91% vs. Würzburg 92%, 93%, 95%). Recommendation by the physician was the main independent factor associated with varicella vaccination in both regions (adjusted odd ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI): Munich OR 19.7, CI 13.6-28.6; Würzburg OR 34.7, CI 22.6-53.2). Attendance at a childcare unit was positively associated with a higher acceptance of varicella vaccination in Munich (OR 1.5, CI 1.1-2.2). Regarding measles vaccination, attendance at a childcare unit was positively associated in both regions (Munich OR 2.0; CI 1.3-3.0; Würzburg OR 1.8; CI 1.1-3.1), and a higher level of parental school education was negatively associated in Würzburg (OR 0.5, CI 0.3-0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination rates differed between regions, with rates constantly higher in Würzburg. Within each region, vaccination rates were lower for varicella than for measles. Measles vaccination status was mainly dependent upon socio-demographic factors (attendance at a childcare unit, parental school education), whereas for the more recently introduced varicella vaccination recommendation by the physician had the strongest impact. Hence, different strategies are needed to further improve vaccination rates for both diseases.","['Hagemann C', 'Streng A', 'Kraemer A', 'Liese JG']",2017,17,1,BMC Public Health,"Hagemann C, et al.

28910710,Outer nuclear membrane fusion of adjacent nuclei in varicella-zoster virus-induced syncytia.,"Syncytia formation has been considered important for cell-to-cell spread and pathogenesis of many viruses. As a syncytium forms, individual nuclei often congregate together, allowing close contact of nuclear membranes and possibly fusion to occur. However, there is currently no reported evidence of nuclear membrane fusion between adjacent nuclei in wild-type virus-induced syncytia. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is one typical syncytia-inducing virus that causes chickenpox and shingles in humans. Here, we report, for the first time, an interesting observation of apparent fusion of the outer nuclear membranes from juxtaposed nuclei that comprise VZV syncytia both in ARPE-19 human epithelial cells in vitro and in human skin xenografts in the SCID-hu mouse model in vivo. This work reveals a novel aspect of VZV-related cytopathic effect in the context of multinucleated syncytia. Additionally, the information provided by this study could be helpful for future studies on interactions of viruses with host cell nuclei.","['Wang W', 'Yang L', 'Huang X', 'Fu W', 'Pan D', 'Cai L', 'Ye J', 'Liu J', 'Xia N', 'Cheng T', 'Zhu H']",2017,512,,Virology,"Wang W, et al.

28900551,Appendicitis Caused by Primary Varicella Zoster Virus Infection in a Child with DiGeorge Syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Chickenpox is caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV). Although predominantly a mild disease, it can cause considerable morbidity and in rare occasions even mortality in healthy children as well as increased morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The aetiology of appendicitis is largely unknown but is thought to be multifactorial. Appendicitis is a suspected, but not well documented, complication from varicella zoster virus infection.
CASE PRESENTATION: A five-year-old girl diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome and a prolonged primary VZV infection was admitted due to abdominal pain, increasing diarrhoea, vomiting, and poor general condition. She developed perforated appendicitis and an intraperitoneal abscess. VZV DNA was detected by PCR in two samples from the appendix and pus from the abdomen, respectively. The child was treated with acyclovir and antibiotics and the abscess was drained twice. She was discharged two weeks after referral with no sequela.
CONCLUSION: Abdominal pain in children with viral infections can be a challenge, and appendicitis has to be considered as a complication to acute viral diseases, especially if the child is immunocompromised.","['Smedegaard LM', 'Christiansen CB', 'Melchior LC', 'Poulsen A']",2017,2017,,Case Rep Pediatr,"Smedegaard LM, et al.

28895689,A cost-benefit analysis of varicella vaccination in Aragón.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella, a contagious and infectious disease that is usually benign in children, may become complicated among adults and vulnerable children and may even be life-threatening. There are effective vaccines. A retrospective study was conducted about costs and resulting hospitalizations related to this disease in the population of Aragón in the 2004-2014 period. Costs were compared to the expenses that would have been incurred if those people had received the vaccine and also to the expenses of vaccinating the 1-year-old population over the entire period. A cost-benefit analysis was done to assess the economic impact of varicella vaccination.
METHOD: Data for the 11-year period were provided by the Autonomous Community of Aragón (Spain) and included annual varicella incidence, hospital discharges of varicella cases, costs of primary health care visits and hospitalizations for each year, costs of each workday as per the minimum annual salary and of drugs used). Capitalized costs were estimated and compared to capitalized expenses of vaccination, and a sensitivity analysis was performed.
RESULTS: A benefit-cost ratio of 1.6 was obtained considering that all children who had varicella had been vaccinated and had received a booster dose. A benefit-cost ratio of 1.24 was obtained considering that the vaccine had been administered to every 1-year-old individual at a price of EUR 28.59 per vaccine. Over the 11-year period, 53% of hospitalizations corresponded to children younger than 5 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: Public campaigns for the immunization of children younger than 4 years old with 2 doses lead to cost savings and are cost-effective because the vaccine price results in a benefit-cost ratio greater than 1. A major reduction is expected in the number of hospitalizations among children aged 3-4 years.","['Peña Blasco G', 'Blasco Pérez-Aramendía MJ']",2017,115,5,Arch Argent Pediatr,Peña Blasco G and Blasco Pérez-Aramendía MJ.

28894977,Varicella Coinfection in Patients with Active Monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.,"From 2006 to 2007, an active surveillance program for human monkeypox (MPX) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified 151 cases of coinfection with monkeypox virus and varicella zoster virus from 1158 suspected cases of human MPX (13%). Using clinical and socio-demographic data collected with standardized instruments by trained, local nurse supervisors, we examined a variety of hypotheses to explain the unexpectedly high proportion of coinfections among the sample, including the hypothesis that the two viruses occur independently. The probabilities of disease incidence and selection necessary to yield the observed sample proportion of coinfections under an assumption of independence are plausible given what is known and assumed about human MPX incidence. Cases of human MPX are expected to be underreported, and more coinfections are expected with improved surveillance.","['Hoff NA', 'Morier DS', 'Kisalu NK', 'Johnston SC', 'Doshi RH', 'Hensley LE', 'Okitolonda-Wemakoy E', 'Muyembe-Tamfum JJ', 'Lloyd-Smith JO', 'Rimoin AW']",2017,14,3,Ecohealth,"Hoff NA, et al.

28853391,Trends in the burden of varicella in UK general practice.,"Childhood varicella vaccination has not yet been introduced in the UK. To inform decision-making about future vaccine programmes, data on the burden of varicella in general practice over a 10-year period (01/01/2005-31/12/2014) was calculated by age and ethnicity, using anonymised data from >8 million individuals in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Varicella consultations peaked at 20 603 in 2007, then decreased annually in all age groups to 11 243 in 2014. Each year, consultation rates were common among infants, were highest among 1-3 year olds (61·2 consultations/1000 person-years in 2007, 39·7/1000 person-years in 2014) and then fell with increasing age to <1·0/1000 person-years at ages ⩾20 years. Varicella acquisition appeared to be delayed in some ethnic groups, with lower consultation rates for children aged <3 years but increased rates for older children and adults aged ⩽40 years among those of black African, Afro-Caribbean, South Asian or other Asian ethnicity. Decreasing general practice consultation rates over time could reflect changes in healthcare utilisation, with patients seeking care in alternative settings such as Accident and Emergency Departments, although current data prevent full assessment of this. Availability of data on varicella diagnoses across all health settings would enable estimation of the total healthcare burden due to varicella and the cost-effectiveness of introducing varicella vaccination.","['Walker JL', 'Andrews NJ', 'Mathur R', 'Smeeth L', 'Thomas SL']",2017,145,13,Epidemiol Infect,"Walker JL, et al.

28837546,"National, Regional, State, and Selected Local Area Vaccination Coverage Among Adolescents Aged 13-17 Years - United States, 2016.","The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adolescents routinely receive tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (1) at age 11-12 years. ACIP also recommends catch-up vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and varicella vaccine for adolescents who are not up to date with childhood vaccinations. ACIP recommends a booster dose of MenACWY at age 16 years (1). In December 2016, ACIP updated HPV vaccine recommendations to include a 2-dose schedule for immunocompetent adolescents initiating the vaccination series before their 15th birthday (2). To estimate adolescent vaccination coverage in the United States, CDC analyzed data from the 2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) for 20,475 adolescents aged 13-17 years.* During 2015-2016, coverage increased for ≥1 dose of Tdap (from 86.4% to 88.0%) and for each HPV vaccine dose (from 56.1% to 60.4% for ≥1 dose). Among adolescents aged 17 years, coverage with ≥2 doses of MenACWY increased from 33.3% to 39.1%.

28834954,Low Varicella Zoster Virus Seroprevalence Among Young Children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes both varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles) and is associated with significant global morbidity. Most epidemiological data on VZV come from high-income countries, and to date there are limited data on the burden of VZV in Africa.
METHODS: We assessed the seroprevalence of VZV antibodies among children in the Democratic Republic of Congo in collaboration with the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey. Dried blood spot samples collected from children 6-59 months of age were run on Dynex™ Technologies Multiplier FLEX® chemiluminescent immunoassay platform to assess serologic response. Multivariate logistic regression was then used to determine risk factors for VZV seropositivity.
RESULTS: Serologic and survey data were matched for 7,195 children 6-59 months of age, among whom 8% were positive and 2% indeterminate for VZV antibodies in weighted analyses. In multivariate analyses, the odds of seropositivity increased with increasing age, increasing socioeconomic status, mother's education level, rural residence, and province (South Kivu, North Kivu, Bandundu, Bas Congo had the highest odds of a positive test result compared with Kinshasa).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that VZV is circulating in DRC, and seropositivity is low among children 6-59 months. Seropositivity increased with age and varied by other sociodemographic factors, such as geographic location. This study provides the first nationally representative estimates of VZV infection among children in the DRC.","['Doshi RH', 'Alfonso VH', 'Mukadi P', 'Hoff NA', 'Gerber S', 'Bwaka A', 'Higgins SG', 'Sinai C', 'Cowell B', 'Ngoie Mwamba G', 'Okitolonda E', 'Muyembe-Tamfum JJ', 'Rimoin AW']",2018,37,2,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Doshi RH, et al.

28825165,Presumed autoimmune retinopathy following chickenpox; a case report.,"PURPOSE: To report a case of presumed autoimmune retinopathy in a patient who had been diagnosed with chickenpox immediately prior to symptom onset.
METHOD: This is a retrospective case report with fundus autofluorescence and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.
RESULTS: A 29-year-old immunocompetent man presented with a two-month history of photopsia and a bluish light predominantly in the left eye with onset immediately following a diagnosis of chickenpox. He subsequently developed blurring of vision in his left eye with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showing disruption and loss of ellipsoid layer in a perivascular pattern in both eyes with fundus autofluorescence demonstrating an abnormal increase in autofluorescence predominately around the vascular arcades. Autoimmune retinopathy was suspected on the basis of the clinical presentation, electrophysiology, absence of fundus lesions, retinal degenerations or dystrophies, or intraocular inflammation and temporal association with varicella infection. Antiretinal antibody testing with Western blot and immunohistochemistry were reported to be negative, however, given the consistent evidence from all other aspects of workup and investigation the patient was commenced on a trial of prednisone. This resulted in marked reduction in photopsia and expansion of visual fields.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of autoimmune retinopathy is ultimately clinical in nature. Despite the absence of positive retinal autoantibodies, a diagnosis of autoimmune retinopathy was made based upon consistent evidence from all other aspects of workup and investigation. This allowed prompt treatment with immunosuppressive agents with subsequent stabilization of this patient's visual function.","['Prime Z', 'Sims J', 'Danesh-Meyer H']",2018,38,5,Int Ophthalmol,"Prime Z, et al.

28806450,Evaluation of Combination Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella Vaccine Introduction in Australia.,"IMPORTANCE: Incorporating combination vaccines, such as the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, into immunization schedules should be evaluated from a benefit-risk perspective. Use of MMRV vaccine poses challenges due to a recognized increased risk of febrile seizures (FSs) when used as the first dose in the second year of life. Conversely, completion by age 2 years of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella immunization may offer improved disease control.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect on safety and coverage of earlier (age 18 months) scheduling of MMRV vaccine as the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) in Australia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective active sentinel safety surveillance comparing the relative incidence (RI) of FSs in toddlers given MMRV and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and a national cohort study of vaccine coverage rates and timeliness before and after MMRV vaccine introduction were conducted. All Australian children aged 11 to 72 months were included in the coverage analysis, and 1471 Australian children aged 11 to 59 months were included in the FS analysis, with a focus on those aged 11 to 23 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: MMRV vaccine safety, specifically, the RI of FSs after MMRV vaccine at age 18 months, compared with risk following MMR vaccine and vaccine uptake for 2-dose MCV and single-dose varicella vaccine, focusing on timeliness.
RESULTS: Of the 1471 children, the median age at first FS was 21 months (interquartile range [IQR], 14-31 months). Three hundred ninety-one children were aged 11 to 23 months and had at least 1 FS included in the analysis; of these, 207 (52.9%) were male. A total of 278 children (71.1%) had received MMR followed by MMRV vaccine, 97 (24.8%) had received MMR vaccine only, and 16 (4.1%) had received neither vaccine. There was no increased risk of FSs (RI, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.55-2.13) in the 5 to 12 days following MMRV vaccine given as the second MCV to toddlers. Febrile seizures occurred after dose 1 of MMR vaccine at a known low increased risk (RI, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.71- 4.29). Following program implementation, 2-dose MCV coverage at age 36 months exceeded that obtained at age 60 months in historical cohorts recommended to receive MMR vaccine before school entry, and on-time vaccination increased by 13.5% (from 58.9% to 72.4%). Despite no change in the scheduled age of varicella vaccine, use of MMRV vaccine was associated with a 4.0% increase in 1-dose varicella vaccine coverage.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence of the absence of an association between use of MMRV vaccine as the second dose of MCV in toddlers and an increased risk of FSs. Incorporation of MMRV vaccine has facilitated improvements in vaccine coverage that will potentially improve disease control.","['Macartney K', 'Gidding HF', 'Trinh L', 'Wang H', 'Dey A', 'Hull B', 'Orr K', 'McRae J', 'Richmond P', 'Gold M', 'Crawford N', 'Kynaston JA', 'McIntyre P', 'Wood N', 'Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance Network']",2017,171,10,JAMA Pediatr,"Macartney K, et al.

28803571,A national register-based study of paediatric varicella hospitalizations in Denmark 2010-2016.,"Varicella, usually a mild disease of childhood, can also cause complications and hospitalization. Universal varicella immunization is implemented in several countries worldwide, but not in Denmark. Taking advantage of unique national registers, we aimed to estimate the incidence of paediatric varicella hospitalizations and assess determinants for hospitalization. For this purpose, we designed a nationwide, retrospective register study of paediatric varicella hospitalizations and applied a case-cohort design and logistic regression analysis comparing hospitalized varicella patients to a sample of the entire paediatric population in Denmark. Varicella patients were identified in The Danish National Patient Register and referents were randomly selected from the Danish Civil Registration System. The incidence of paediatric varicella admissions was 11/100 000 children 0-18 years of age/year. Of admitted children 67·1% had complications and 30·0% had underlying disease. All categories of underlying disease significantly increased the odds of hospitalization as well as male gender and not having been born in Denmark. In conclusion, we found a considerable burden of paediatric varicella disease in Danish hospitals, of similar magnitude as in other European countries comparable to Denmark. With this study we have provided epidemiological data needed for considering implementation of varicella vaccine in Denmark.","['Helmuth IG', 'Poulsen A', 'Mølbak K']",2017,145,13,Epidemiol Infect,"Helmuth IG, et al.

28795455,Perceptions of caregivers and providers regarding the potential introduction of the varicella vaccine to the childhood immunisation schedule in New Zealand: A qualitative exploratory study.,"AIM: The varicella vaccine has been proposed to be added to the childhood immunisation schedule in New Zealand as the fourth injectable at the 15-month event. We sought to understand the perceptions of caregivers and health-care providers regarding the potential introduction of routine varicella vaccination.
METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with caregivers and providers (N = 20) in Auckland. Key themes from the interviews were identified through thematic analysis using a combination of deductive and inductive coding.
RESULTS: All of the participants were aware of varicella but levels of awareness varied among caregivers regarding the varicella vaccine. Participants expressed positive support towards universal varicella vaccination and a high intention to vaccinate if available as a routine vaccine. However, many concerns were raised about multiple injections at a single immunisation visit, and participants suggested alternative scheduling options.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated a need to raise awareness among caregivers about the varicella vaccine, focusing on positive health beliefs about vaccination in terms of protecting the child's health and reducing the impact of a child getting varicella on the family. Health-care providers and government health authorities may play an important role in increasing positive health beliefs about the varicella vaccine. Should the varicella vaccine be introduced as proposed, our findings recommend an educational campaign to address both caregiver and provider concerns about multiple injections and how to manage alternative immunisation schedules. These insights may help inform national strategies for the proposed addition to increase acceptance of the varicella vaccination.","['Charania NA', 'Watson DG', 'Turner NM']",2018,54,1,J Paediatr Child Health,"Charania NA, et al.

28784281,Evaluating the effectiveness of the universal immunization program against varicella in Japanese children.,"OBJECTIVE: Matched case control study was conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the Oka/Biken vaccine immediately after implementation of the universal immunization program in Japan.
METHODS: Cases were laboratory confirmed varicella patient under 15years of age diagnosed at 14 designated pediatric clinics between September 2015 and September 2016. Controls were selected from patients who visited the same practice for different reasons as the varicella case within 2weeks. Swab samples were collected from varicella suspected patients and molecular diagnostic assays were used to confirm varicella cases. Matched odds ratio were used to calculate vaccine effectiveness (VE).
RESULTS: Varicella zoster virus DNA was detected in 183 (81.3%) of 225 suspected cases. One sample was excluded because it was positive for the Oka vaccine strain (182/225, 80.9%). Three hundred twenty-three control subjects were enrolled. The effectiveness of 1 dose of the Oka/Biken vaccine compared with no vaccine was 76.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 58.6-86.9%; P<0.001). The effectiveness of 2 doses of the Oka/Biken vaccine was 94.2% (95% CI: 85.7-97.6%; P<0.001). After adjusting for potential confounding effects, the adjusted VE of 1 and 2 doses of varicella vaccine were 76.9% (95% CI: 58.1-87.3%; P<0.001) and 94.7% (95% CI: 86.0-98.0%; P<0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: VE of one dose of Oka/Biken varicella vaccine was insufficient to control varicella. Therefore, two doses of Oka/Biken varicella vaccine is significant for controlling varicella in Japan.","['Hattori F', 'Miura H', 'Sugata K', 'Yoshikawa A', 'Ihira M', 'Yahata Y', 'Kamiya H', 'Tanaka-Taya K', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Nagoya VZV study group']",2017,35,37,Vaccine,"Hattori F, et al.

28757060,MMR and MMRV vaccines.,"Measles, mumps, rubella and varicella are viral infections which can implicate seriously long-term sequelae of infected individuals or even the unborn child. Vaccines against the individual diseases have long been available. Global measles vaccination is estimated to have prevented more than 20million deaths during 2000-2015. During the same time period, measles incidence decreased from 146 to 36 cases per million populations. Today vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella are now carried out mainly with combination vaccines. These are today known as immunogenic and safe. MMRV had similar immunogenicity and overall safety profiles to MMR administered with or without varicella vaccine. This issue provides a review of the different vaccines, mode of administration, catch up immunization and postexposure prophylaxis as well as contraindications and adverse effects of the immunization against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. The article presents an overview of important information of preventing these diseases with a focus on the existing combination vaccines.","['Kowalzik F', 'Faber J', 'Knuf M']",2018,36,36,Vaccine,"Kowalzik F, et al.

28752294,Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of Varicella-zoster virus strains isolated from Korean patients.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a causative agent of chickenpox in primary infection and shingles after its reactivation from latency. Complete or almost-complete genomic DNA sequences for various VZV strains have been reported. Recently, clinical VZV strains were isolated from Korean patients whose genome was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology. In this study, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of VZV strains to genetically characterize Korean clinical isolates. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that three Korean strains, YC01, YC02, and YC03, were linked to clade 2. Comprehensive SNP analysis identified 86 sites specific for the 5 VZV clades. VZV strains isolated from Korea did not form a phylogenetic cluster. Rather, YC02 and YC03 clustered strongly with Chinese strain 84-7 within clade 2, more specifically cluster 2a. Signature sequences for the cluster 2a were identified and found to play an important role in the separation of cluster 2a strains from other clade 2 strains, as shown in substitution studies. Further genetic analysis with additional strains isolated from Japan, China, and other Asian countries would provide a novel insight into the significance of two distinct subclades within clade 2.","['Kim MH', 'Jeon JS', 'Kim IK', 'Park JS', 'Park H', 'Shin OS', 'Lee CH']",2017,55,8,J Microbiol,"Kim MH, et al.

Effective attenuated vaccines (vOka) are available for prevention of both illnesses. In this study, an amplicon-based sequencing method capable of differentiating between VZV wild-type (wt) strains and vOka vaccine is described. A total of 44 vesicular fluid specimens collected from 43 patients (16 from China and 27 from the UK) with either chickenpox or shingles were investigated, of which 10 had received previous vaccination. Four sets of polymerase chain reactions were set up simultaneously with primers amplifying regions encompassing four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), '69349-106262-107252-108111'. Nucleotide sequences were generated by Sanger sequencing. All samples except one had a wt SNP profile of 'A-T-T-T'. The sample collected from a patient who received vaccine 7-10 days ago, along with VZV vaccine preparations, Zostavax and Baike-varicella gave a SNP profile 'G-C-C-C'. The results show that this method can distinguish vaccine-derived virus from wt viruses from main four clades, (clades 1-4) and should be of utility worldwide.","['Jin L', 'Xu S', 'Maple PAC', 'Xu W', 'Brown KE']",2017,145,12,Epidemiol Infect,"Jin L, et al.

28735059,Too young to be vaccinated: hospitalizations caused by varicella among children in the first year of life.,"AIM: The aim of this study was to analyse the causes of hospitalization in the course of varicella in children during the first year of life.
METHODS: An analysis was performed of the medical documentation of 359 children hospitalized for varicella on the infectious diseases ward at the Children's Hospital in Poznan (Poland) between January 2007 and August 2015.
RESULTS: Of the 359 children in the study group, 96 were younger than 1 year old. The most common cause of hospitalization was respiratory infections, found in 31 (32%) children. A severe course of varicella was observed in 38 (14%) children, and 21 (22%) developed skin infections, while 11 (11%) exhibited more than one complication. Treatment with acyclovir was implemented in 90 cases and parenteral antibiotic therapy was applied in 49 children. Contact with siblings suffering from varicella was confirmed in 46 children; for 16, the source of the infection was the mother.
CONCLUSIONS: The main source of varicella virus among hospitalized children in the first year of life is home contact. An infant may become infected from its mother suffering from zoster. Children who are exclusively breastfed and are born of mothers who have previously had varicella may develop varicella with a severe course during the first year of life.","['Gowin E', 'Wysocki J', 'Michalak M', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D']",2017,62,,Int J Infect Dis,"Gowin E, et al.

The CIDARS can detect outbreak signals in a timely manner but generates many false-positive signals, especially for diseases with seasonality. We assessed the influence of seasonality on infectious disease outbreak detection performance. Methods Chickenpox surveillance data in Songjiang District, Shanghai were used. The optimized early alert thresholds for chickenpox were selected according to three algorithm evaluation indexes: sensitivity (Se), false alarm rate (FAR), and time to detection (TTD). Performance of selected proper thresholds was assessed by data external to the study period. Results The optimized early alert threshold for chickenpox during the epidemic season was the percentile P65, which demonstrated an Se of 93.33%, FAR of 0%, and TTD of 0 days. The optimized early alert threshold in the nonepidemic season was P50, demonstrating an Se of 100%, FAR of 18.94%, and TTD was 2.5 days. The performance evaluation demonstrated that the use of an optimized threshold adjusted for seasonality could reduce the FAR and shorten the TTD. Conclusions Selection of optimized early alert thresholds based on local infectious disease seasonality could improve the performance of the CIDARS.","['Wang R', 'Jiang Y', 'Guo X', 'Wu Y', 'Zhao G']",2018,46,1,J Int Med Res,"Wang R, et al.

28715624,[Chickenpox seroprevalence among healthcare and social assistance workers in Catalonia (Spain)].,"AIMS: Chickenpox is a frequent and contagious disease in healthcare and social assistance settings, and there are limited data on seroprevalence among workers in this sector. We estimated susceptibility to chickenpox among workers, by demographic and occupational variables, and measured the rate of seroprotection after vaccination.
METHODS: A retrospective seroprevalence study of chickenpox (varicella) and serological vaccine response. The earliest recorded varicella serology, analyzed by the ELISA method, was identified for each worker from a health surveillance database of a group of medical and healthcare companies in Catalonia, recorded between 2004 and 2013. The total study population consisted of 2958 workers, analyzed by gender, age, birth cohort preceding and following the introduction of the vaccine in the vaccination schedule of Catalonia (born after 1993), and occupational category, regardless of exposure risk. Vaccine effectiveness was determined in a group of 59 initi lly seronegative workers by measuring ELISA-based varicella titers, obtained at least 2 months after receiving a second dose of the VARIVAX® vaccine.
RESULTS: 2820 workers (95.3%) had protective titers (PT) to chickenpox; 507 were men (97.1%) and 2313 were women (95%). The 1993 and earlier birth cohorts had a PT of 95.4% and those born after 1993 had a PT of 80.0%. Among at-risk categories, the PT was 95.2%, whereas among those not at risk it was was 96%. By birth decade, the lowest PT was among those age 60 years or older (93.3%). The postvaccination serological response was 89.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of protective varicella serologies among healthcare and social assistance workers was similar to that found in recent seroprevalence studies in the general population in Catalonia. Men have significantly higher rates of protection than women. Those born after 1993 have significantly lower rates of protective titers than those born in 1993 or earlier.","['Inglés Torruella J', 'Gil Soto R']",2017,20,3,Arch Prev Riesgos Labor,Inglés Torruella J and Gil Soto R.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic burden associated with varicella in Hungary.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective, chart review study of patients aged 1-12 years with a primary varicella diagnosis between 2011 and 2015. Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) associated with varicella, unit costs, and work loss were used to estimate direct and indirect costs. All costs are presented in 2015 HUF / Euros (€).
RESULTS: 156 children with varicella were included (75 outpatients, 81 inpatients), with a mean age of 4.4 (SD: 2.0) and 3.7 (SD: 2.1) years, respectively. One or more complications were reported by 12.0% of outpatients and 92.6% of inpatients, the most common being dehydration, skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, keratoconjunctivitis, and cerebellitis. HCRU estimates included use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications (96.0% outpatients, 53.1% inpatients), prescription medications (9.3% outpatients, 70.4% inpatients), tests/procedures (4.0% outpatients, 97.5% inpatients), and consultation with allied health professionals (2.7% outpatients, 30.9% inpatients). The average duration of hospital stay (inpatients) was 3.6 (95% CI: 3.2, 4.1) days. The total combined direct and indirect cost per varicella case was 228,146.7 Hungarian Forint (HUF)/€ 736.0 for inpatients and 49,790.6 HUF/€ 106.6 for outpatients. The overall annual cost of varicella in Hungary for children aged <15 years in 2015 was estimated at 1,903,332,524.3 HUF/ € 6,139,980.4.
CONCLUSION: Varicella is associated with substantial clinical burden in Hungary, resulting in the utilization of a significant amount of healthcare resources. These results support the need for routine vaccination of all healthy children to reduce the varicella-associated disease burden.","['Meszner Z', 'Molnar Z', 'Rampakakis E', 'Yang HK', 'Kuter BJ', 'Wolfson LJ']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Meszner Z, et al.

28698046,Simian varicella virus causes robust transcriptional changes in T cells that support viral replication.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox) during acute infection. Several studies have shown that T cells are early and preferential targets of VZV infection that play a critical role in disseminating VZV in to the skin and ganglia. However, the transcriptional changes that occur in VZV-infected T cells remain unclear due to limited access to clinical samples and robust translational animal models. In this study, we used a nonhuman primate model of VZV infection where rhesus macaques are infected with the closely related Simian Varicella Virus (SVV) to provide novel insights into VZV-T cell interactions. RNA sequencing of bronchial alveolar lavage-resident T cells isolated from infected rhesus macaques show that SVV infection alters expression of genes important for regulation of gene expression, cell cycle progression, metabolism, and antiviral immunity. These data provide insight into cellular processes that may support viral replication, facilitate SVV dissemination, and evade host defense.","['Arnold N', 'Messaoudi I']",2017,238,,Virus Res,Arnold N and Messaoudi I.

28696824,Age-appropriate versus up-to-date coverage of routine childhood vaccinations among young children in Israel.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Routine childhood vaccinations schedules recommend that children receive the vaccine doses at specific ages. Vaccination coverage data are conventionally reported by the up-to-date method. We aimed to assess vaccination timeliness by the age-appropriate method and compare with the up-to-date vaccination coverage.
METHODS: Assessment of age-appropriate and up-to-date vaccination coverage among children born in Israel in 2009 and followed to age 48 months (national representative sample, n = 3892). The vaccinations included: Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis-Polio-Haemophilus-influenzae-b (DTaP-IPV-Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), Measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (MMR/MMRV) and Hepatitis A vaccine (HAV). The categories defined: age-appropriate (at the recommended age and up to 1 month), delayed less than 6 months, delayed 6 months and above and unvaccinated (48 months).
RESULTS: The age-specific vaccinations assessment showed considerable delay in receipt of routine vaccination. While most (96%, 95%, 91%, 96%, 94% and 86%) children were vaccinated up-to-date for HBV3, DTaP-IPV-Hib4, PCV3, MMR/MMRV1, HAV1and HAV2 vaccine doses; only 26%, 29%, 47%, 64%, 55% and 12% were vaccinated age-appropriate. Vaccination delay was more common in vaccines with multiple doses. Vaccination delay was associated with high child's birth order, low socio-economic rank, ethnicity (delay more common in Jews vs. Arabs), season of birth (winter) and delayed receipt of DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine 1st dose.
CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed age-appropriate childhood vaccination coverage in a national cohort of children. While the overall vaccination coverage stands in line with the WHO goals, vaccination timeliness and equity are inadequate and targeted public health intervention programs aimed at vaccination timeliness are necessary.","['Stein-Zamir C', 'Israeli A']",2017,13,9,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Stein-Zamir C and Israeli A.

28684165,"Varicella outbreak in a highly-vaccinated school population in Beijing, China during the voluntary two-dose era.","BACKGROUND: Two-dose varicella vaccination has been available in Beijing since 2012 in the private sector. We investigated a varicella outbreak in a highly vaccinated elementary school population.
METHODS: A cohort study was carried out and a varicella case was defined as an acute onset of generalized maculopapulovesicular rash without other apparent cause in a student attending the school from March 29 through May 17, 2015. Breakthrough varicella was defined as varicella >42days after the last vaccine dose among both 1- or 2-dose varicella vaccine recipients. Vaccination information was collected from immunization records; information on prior varicella and clinical presentations was collected by surveying students' parents.
RESULTS: Of the 1056 students in the school, 1027 (97.3%) reported no history of varicella. Prior to the outbreak, 98.6% of students had received ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine, and most (63.2%) students received two doses. Twenty varicella cases were identified for an overall attack rate of 2.0%. Half of the cases occurred in the classroom of the index case-patient, a two-dose recipient who was not isolated after symptom onset. Breakthrough varicella accounted for 95% of cases (19/20) with attack rates of 14.3% (1/7), 1.6% (6/362) and 2.0% (13/649) among unvaccinated, one-dose, and two-dose students, respectively. Most case-patients (18/20, 90%) had <50 lesions. No difference in clinical presentations was found between one-dose and two-dose recipients with breakthrough varicella.
CONCLUSION: Moderate two-dose varicella vaccine coverage was insufficient to prevent a varicella outbreak. Two-dose recipients with breakthrough varicella are contagious. High two-dose varicella vaccine coverage and timely isolation of cases may be needed for varicella outbreak prevention in the two-dose era.","['Suo L', 'Lu L', 'Wang Q', 'Yang F', 'Wang X', 'Pang X', 'Marin M', 'Wang C']",2017,35,34,Vaccine,"Suo L, et al.

28671426,Vaccine Adverse Events: Separating Myth from Reality.,"Vaccines are one of the most successful medical advances in modern times. Most vaccine-preventable illnesses are unfamiliar to modern parents. Because of this, parents are increasingly questioning the necessity of immunizing their children, especially because no vaccine is completely free of adverse effects or the risk of complications. Family physicians should be aware of the risks and benefits of recommended immunizations. Thimerosal is currently used only in multidose vials of influenza vaccine, and exposure through vaccines is not associated with adverse neurologic outcomes. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is not associated with autism. Vaccines are associated with local reactions, such as pain and erythema. The rotavirus vaccine minimally increases the rate of intussusception, whereas other vaccines minimally increase the risk of syncope. Although immunization with the human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended for all boys and girls, vaccination rates remain low. Physicians should guide parents to credible resources if they are considering vaccine refusal. If a recommended vaccine is refused, proper documentation is essential. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program track adverse events and allow compensation for documented harms from vaccinations.","['Spencer JP', 'Trondsen Pawlowski RH', 'Thomas S']",2017,95,12,Am Fam Physician,"Spencer JP, et al.

28662876,Herpes Zoster Involving the Second Division of the Trigeminal Nerve: Case Report and Literature Review.,"Herpes zoster along the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve is a rare condition that is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that resides within the trigeminal ganglion after the primary infection of chickenpox. The disease may be manifested as a toothache during its prodromal stage. The active stage of the disease is characterized by the appearance of a vesicular rash. Postherpetic neuralgia is a common complication of herpes zoster after resolution of the facial and intraoral symptoms. There is increasing evidence for herpes zoster patients to develop stroke later in life. The present case reports the development of herpes zoster maxillaris in a 71-year-old man whose maxillary right canine was diagnosed as pulpal necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis and was subsequently treated endodontically by cleaning and shaping and filling the canal space with gutta-percha and an epoxy resin-based sealer. The patient presented 3 days later with midfacial ulceration, desquamation, and crusting as well as intraoral ulceration along the course of the V2 dermatome. After successful treatment with antiviral medication, postherpetic neuralgia developed within the next 2 months. Complete resolution of the neuralgia occurred at the 4-month recall with negligible facial scarring. Herpes zoster may mimic odontogenic pain during the prodromal stage of the disease. Reactivation of the virus has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulpal pathoses. These paradoxical facets are of interest to the endodontist and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the disease.","['Paquin R', 'Susin LF', 'Welch G', 'Barnes JB', 'Stevens MR', 'Tay FR']",2017,43,9,J Endod,"Paquin R, et al.

28662875,The Role of Varicella Zoster Virus in the Development of Periapical Pathoses and Root Resorption: A Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) and subsequent herpes zoster (HZ) infection have been proposed as a causative agent of periapical pathoses and root resorption. This review aimed to identify, synthesize, and present a critical analysis of the available data on the association among VZV, subsequent HZ infection, and the development of periapical pathoses and root resorption and to analyze the level of evidence of available studies.
METHODS: The literature search covered MEDLINE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Scopus. A qualitative critical appraisal of the included articles was performed.
RESULTS: The electronic database search yielded 66 hits from PubMed, 73 hits from Web of Science, and 107 from Scopus. Seven case reports and 3 cross-sectional studies were included in the final review. When summarized, in 7 patients with a history of a previous HZ attack and with no other apparent cause, 23 teeth were diagnosed with apical periodontitis, 8 teeth with internal and 1 tooth with external root resorption. The cross-sectional studies investigated the presence of VZV DNA in samples of acute apical abscess. The VZV DNA was found only in 2 of 65 samples.
CONCLUSIONS: All studies included in this systematic review had a low level of evidence (4 and 5). Still, the potential role of VZV in the etiopathogenesis of periapical pathoses and root resorption cannot be ruled out. Future investigations should be directed toward the analysis of VZV pathologic effects on pulp blood vessels, which might cause local ischemia and tissue necrosis.","['Jakovljevic A', 'Kuzmanovic Pficer J', 'Dragan IF', 'Knezevic A', 'Miletic M', 'Beljic-Ivanovic K', 'Milasin J', 'Andric M']",2017,43,8,J Endod,"Jakovljevic A, et al.

28657969,"Varicella-related Primary Health-care Visits, Hospitalizations and Mortality in Norway, 2008-2014.","BACKGROUND: Norway does not currently implement universal varicella vaccination in childhood. We aimed to characterize health care burden of varicella in Norway in the prevaccine era.
METHODS: We linked individual patient data from different national registries to examine varicella vaccinations and varicella-coded primary care consultations, hospitalizations, outpatient hospital visits, deaths and viral infections of central nervous system in the whole population of Norway during 2008-2014. We estimated health care contact rates and described the epidemiology of medically attended varicella infection.
RESULTS: Each year approximately 14,600 varicella-related contacts occurred within primary health care and hospital sector in Norway. The annual contact rate was 221 cases per 100,000 population in primary health care and 7.3 cases per 100,000 in hospital care. Both in primary and hospital care, the highest incidences were observed among children 1 year of age: 2,654 and 78.1 cases per 100,000, respectively. The annual varicella mortality was estimated at 0.06 deaths per 100,000 and in-hospital case-fatality rate at 0.3%. Very few (0.2-0.5%) patients were vaccinated against varicella. Among hospitalized varicella patients, 22% had predisposing conditions, 9% had severe-to-very severe comorbidities and 5.5% were immunocompromised. Varicella-related complications were reported in 29.3% of hospitalized patients. Varicella zoster virus was the third most frequent virus found among 16% of patients with confirmed viral infections of central nervous system.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella causes a considerable health care burden in Norway, especially among children. To inform the policy decision on the use of varicella vaccination, a health economic assessment of vaccination and mathematical modeling of vaccination impact are needed.","['Mirinaviciute G', 'Kristensen E', 'Nakstad B', 'Flem E']",2017,36,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Mirinaviciute G, et al.

Complications include bacterial superinfection, central nervous system manifestations such as meningitis, encephalitis, and cerebellar ataxia, and pain syndromes especially post herpetic neuralgia. Many developed countries but not all, are now administering live attenuated varicella vaccine routinely, with a decrease in the incidence of disease, providing personal and herd immunity. There is some controversy, however, in some countries concerning whether a decrease in the circulation of wild type virus will result in loss of immunity to VZV in persons who have already had varicella. This manuscript reviews the complications of varicella and zoster in detail, the reasons for development of vaccines against these diseases, complications of vaccinations, and mechanisms by which immunity to this virus develops and is maintained.

28644696,Varicella vaccination - the global experience.,"Varicella, although a frequently benign childhood disease, nevertheless represents a considerable health burden. WHO recommends including varicella vaccines in universal routine vaccination programs, and maintaining coverage >80%. Many countries have successfully introduced varicella vaccination and have benefited from lower disease burden, but many others have not adopted the vaccine. Reasons include cost commitment for a 'mild childhood disease' or concerns that vaccination will shift varicella to older age groups or increase herpes zoster incidence. Areas covered: This literature review summarizes the effectiveness and epidemiological impact of varicella immunization programs. Expert commentary: Varicella vaccines are immunogenic with acceptable safety profiles. One and two dose schedules are highly effective against varicella and large reductions in disease incidence, particularly moderate-severe disease, have been widely reported. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the introduction of varicella vaccination results in a shift of varicella disease burden to older age groups. Although epidemiological studies have shown an increased incidence of herpes zoster since the vaccines were launched, there are many other contributing factors, and indeed, this secular trend was evident before their introduction. In conclusion, varicella vaccination easily fits into existing immunization programs and significantly reduces the often underestimated burden of varicella.","['Wutzler P', 'Bonanni P', 'Burgess M', 'Gershon A', 'Sáfadi MA', 'Casabona G']",2017,16,8,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Wutzler P, et al.

28637759,Role of the JNK Pathway in Varicella-Zoster Virus Lytic Infection and Reactivation.,"Mechanisms of neuronal infection by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have been challenging to study due to the relatively strict human tropism of the virus and the paucity of tractable experimental models. Cellular mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been shown to play a role in VZV infection of nonneuronal cells, with distinct consequences for infectivity in different cell types. Here, we utilize several human neuronal culture systems to investigate the role of one such MAPK, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), in VZV lytic infection and reactivation. We find that the JNK pathway is specifically activated following infection of human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons and that this activation of JNK is essential for efficient viral protein expression and replication. Inhibition of the JNK pathway blocked viral replication in a manner distinct from that of acyclovir, and an acyclovir-resistant VZV isolate was as sensitive to the effects of JNK inhibition as an acyclovir-sensitive VZV isolate in neurons. Moreover, in a microfluidic-based human neuronal model of viral latency and reactivation, we found that inhibition of the JNK pathway resulted in a marked reduction in reactivation of VZV. Finally, we utilized a novel technique to efficiently generate cells expressing markers of human sensory neurons from neural crest cells and established a critical role for the JNK pathway in infection of these cells. In summary, the JNK pathway plays an important role in lytic infection and reactivation of VZV in physiologically relevant cell types and may provide an alternative target for antiviral therapy.","['Kurapati S', 'Sadaoka T', 'Rajbhandari L', 'Jagdish B', 'Shukla P', 'Ali MA', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee G', 'Cohen JI', 'Venkatesan A']",2017,91,17,J Virol,"Kurapati S, et al.

28624261,Dutch health websites and their ability to inform people with low health literacy.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Dutch online health information (OHI) generally reflects message elements that support information processing and understanding among people with low health literacy.
METHODS: We content-analyzed one hundred Dutch webpages about Ebola, fibromyalgia, ALS, losing weight, borderline personality disorder, hemorrhoids, ADD, bladder infection, shingles, and chicken pox. The codebook covered the following domains: images and videos, readability level, Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM), advertising, interactive features, and reliability cues.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven webpages contained informative images that visualized the text. Twelve webpages incorporated videos, six of which were animations. Readability varied widely, but 79.2% of the texts exceeded the recommended B1 level. Half of the webpages had inadequate SAM scores; five were classified as superior. Interactive features were infrequently used. Many webpages included only a few elements that help users evaluate the reliability of OHI. Four presented a quality label.
CONCLUSION: Over a wide range of health-related topics, Dutch OHI does not generally contain message elements that improve information processing among people with low health literacy.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Communication professionals should make better use of digital message features. Videos, narration, and interactivity are scarcely used but can be valuable for people with low health literacy.","['Meppelink CS', 'van Weert JCM', 'Brosius A', 'Smit EG']",2017,100,11,Patient Educ Couns,"Meppelink CS, et al.

28617860,Increasing prevalence of infectious diseases in asylum seekers at a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland.,"OBJECTIVE: The increasing number of refugees seeking asylum in Europe in recent years poses new challenges for the healthcare systems in the destination countries. The goal of the study was to describe the evolution of medical problems of asylum seekers at a tertiary care centre in Switzerland.
METHODS: At the University Hospital Basel, we compared all asylum seekers during two 1-year time periods in 2004/05 and 2014/15 concerning demographic characteristics and reasons for referrals and hospitalizations.
RESULTS: Hundred ninety five of 2'544 and 516 of 6'243 asylum seekers registered at the national asylum reception and procedure centre Basel were referred to the University Hospital Basel in 2004/05 and 2014/15, and originated mainly from Europe (62.3%, mainly Turkey) and Africa (49.1%, mainly Eritrea), respectively. Median age was similar in both study periods (26.9 and 26.2 years). Infectious diseases in asylum seekers increased from 22.6% to 36.6% (p<0.001) and were the main reasons for hospitalizations (33.3% of 45 and 55.6% of 81 hospitalized patients, p = 0.017) in 2004/05 compared to 2014/15. The leading infectious diseases in hospitalized patients were tuberculosis (n = 4) and bacterial skin infections (n = 2) in 2004/05; Malaria (n = 9), pneumonia (n = 6), Chickenpox (n = 5), other viral infections (n = 5) and bacterial skin infections (n = 5) in 2014/15. Infectious diseases like malaria, cutaneous diphtheria, louseborne-relapsing fever or scabies were only found in the second study period. Almost one third of the admitted asylum seekers required isolation precautions with median duration of 6-9.5 days in both study periods.
CONCLUSIONS: The changing demography of asylum seekers arriving in Switzerland in the current refugee crisis has led to a shift in disease patterns with an increase of infectious diseases and the re-emergence of migration-associated neglected infections. Physicians should be aware of these new challenges.","['Bloch-Infanger C', 'Bättig V', 'Kremo J', 'Widmer AF', 'Egli A', 'Bingisser R', 'Battegay M', 'Erb S']",2017,12,6,PLoS One,"Bloch-Infanger C, et al.

28602605,Vaccination in newly arrived immigrants to the European Union.,"The challenge of assimilating millions of immigrants in the European region each year presents significant socioeconomic issues. Among them is the threat of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) disease transmission within immigrant groups and the broader population given the permeability of nation state borders. A total of 3.8 million people immigrated to the European Union (EU) in 2014, among those were 1.6 million non-EU nationals. While vaccines have markedly reduced the transmission of disease, clusters of under-vaccinated individuals potentiate the rapid transmission of once-eradicated or controlled diseases. Immigrants pose a special challenge to host country public health vaccination programmes. Wars in their native countries may have interrupted vaccination programmes, documentation may be unavailable or unreliable, and refugees may present with health issues due to poor sanitation and food during transit. Further, immigrants are often reticent to access health care in the destination country, or may face financial or language barriers. Thus, preventive health care needs may go unaddressed and the first contact with a clinician is for an emergency. Equitable access to acute and preventive health care and services, including immunizations irrespective of individual's immigration status, should be a priority for European region countries. Ensuring appropriate and timely vaccination for immigrants could be accomplished with a universal European region immunization schedule. Priority should be given to highly communicable VPDs such as measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, diphtheria, varicella and polio.","['Prymula R', 'Shaw J', 'Chlibek R', 'Urbancikova I', 'Prymulova K']",2018,36,36,Vaccine,"Prymula R, et al.

28595358,Reduced Antibody Response to Infant Measles Vaccination: Effects Based on Type and Timing of the First Vaccine Dose Persist After the Second Dose.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of age at first dose on the immunogenicity of a 2-dose pediatric schedule of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine was assessed in children born to mostly vaccinated mothers.
METHODS: Immunogenicity data among children given their first measles vaccine dose between 11 and 22 months of age were pooled from 5 randomized controlled trials conducted in Europe and the United States between 2004 and 2010. Measles antibody titers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after each dose; geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and the proportion seronegative (GMC <150 mIU/mL) were derived by age at first dose.
RESULTS: Among 5542 children given a first measles vaccine dose at 11, 12, 13-14, and 15-22 months of age, the proportion seronegative decreased from 8.5% to 3.2%, 2.4%, and 1.5%, respectively (P < .001), whereas GMCs increased with older age measles vaccine initiation (P < .001). MMRV induced higher GMCs than MMR (P < .001). First and second dose GMCs were highly correlated (Spearman coefficient = 0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: As previously noted among infants born to mothers with history of wild-type measles, antibody responses among children born to vaccinated mothers were reduced based on earlier administration of their first measles vaccine dose at ≤12 vs ≥15 months of age. Negative effects of earlier age at first measles vaccine dose persisted after the second dose. The measles elimination goal may require a careful balance between earlier infant protection and the risk of reduced antibody responses and secondary vaccine failure among successive birth cohorts systematically initiated to measles vaccination <15 months of age.","['Carazo Perez S', 'De Serres G', 'Bureau A', 'Skowronski DM']",2017,65,7,Clin Infect Dis,"Carazo Perez S, et al.

RESULTS: Pneumonia occurred in 8.2% of children hospitalized for varicella. The median length of hospitalization was 6 days. No statistically significant difference in length of stay was detected between immunodepressed children and previously healthy children. The hospitalization was on average shorter in patients who started antiviral therapy within 24 h of varicella onset. None of the included patients had been previously immunized for varicella.

28542182,"Modelling the transmission and control strategies of varicella among school children in Shenzhen, China.","OBJECTIVES: Varicella (chickenpox) is a highly transmissible childhood disease. Between 2010 and 2015, it displayed two epidemic waves annually among school populations in Shenzhen, China. However, their transmission dynamics remain unclear and there is no school-based vaccination programme in Shenzhen to-date. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to compare a school-based vaccination intervention scenario with a baseline (i.e. no intervention) scenario.
METHODS: Data on varicella reported cases were downloaded from the Infectious Disease Reporting Information Management System. We obtained the population size, age structure of children aged 15 or under, the class and school distribution from Shenzhen Education Bureau. We developed an Agent-Based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (ABM-SEIR) Model that considered within-class, class-to-class and out-of-school transmission modes. The intervention scenario was that school-wide vaccination intervention occurred when an outbreak threshold was reached within a school. We varied this threshold level from five to ten cases. We compared the reduction of disease outbreak size and estimated the key epidemiological parameters under the intervention strategy.
RESULTS: Our ABM-SEIR model provided a good model fit to the two annual varicella epidemic waves from 2013 to 2015. The transmission dynamics displayed strong seasonality. Our results suggested that a school-based vaccination strategy could effectively prevent large outbreaks at different thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a considerable increase in reported varicella cases from 2013 to 2015 in Shenzhen. Our modelling study provided important theoretical support for disease control decision making during school outbreaks and the development of a school-based vaccination programme.","['Tang X', 'Zhao S', 'Chiu APY', 'Ma H', 'Xie X', 'Mei S', 'Kong D', 'Qin Y', 'Chen Z', 'Wang X', 'He D']",2017,12,5,PLoS One,"Tang X, et al.

28525973,"Varicella-zoster virus seroprevalence in children and adolescents in the pre-varicella vaccine era, Germany.","BACKGROUND: In 2004, universal childhood varicella vaccination was introduced in Germany. We aimed to determine the age-specific prevalence of anti-varicella zoster virus (VZV) IgG-antibodies among children in the pre-varicella vaccine era in Germany, to identify factors associated with VZV seropositivity, and to assess the suitability of a commercially available ELISA for VZV seroepidemiological studies by comparing it with an in-house fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen test (FAMA) as the gold standard.
METHODS: Serum samples of 13,433 children and adolescents aged 1-17 years included in the population-based German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS; conducted 2003-2006) were tested for anti-VZV IgG by ELISA. All samples with equivocal ELISA results and a random selection of ELISA-negative and -positive samples were tested by FAMA. Statistical analyses were conducted using a weighting factor adjusting the study population to the total population in Germany. Seroprevalences were calculated as percentages (%) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Odds ratios (OR) were computed by multivariate logistic regression to determine the association between socio-demographic factors and VZV seropositivity.
RESULTS: The VZV seropositivity rate was 80.3% (95% CI: 79.3-81.3) in varicella-unvaccinated children and adolescents. VZV seropositivity rates differed significantly between age groups up to age 6 years, but not by gender. Of 118 retested serum samples with an equivocal ELISA result, 45.8% were FAMA-positive. The proportion of samples tested as false-negative in by ELISA varied by age group: 2.6% in children aged 1-6 and 9% in children aged 7-17 years. Multivariate analyses showed that age, having older siblings, and early daycare start were associated with seropositivity in preschoolers; migration background reduced the chance of VZV seropositivity in schoolchildren (OR: 0.65; 0.43-0.99) and adolescents (OR: 0.62; 0.4-0.97).
CONCLUSION: In the pre-varicella vaccine era, most children in Germany contracted varicella by age six. Schoolchildren with a migration background and children without siblings have an increased risk of being VZV seronegative and should be targeted for catch-up vaccination, if they have no history of chickenpox. ELISAs are suitable for use in population-level serosurveys on VZV, but samples with equivocal ELISA results should be retested by FAMA.","['Wiese-Posselt M', 'Siedler A', 'Mankertz A', 'Sauerbrei A', 'Hengel H', 'Wichmann O', 'Poethko-Müller C']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Wiese-Posselt M, et al.

28521810,Estimation of the burden of varicella in Europe before the introduction of universal childhood immunization.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is generally considered a mild disease. Disease burden is not well known and country-level estimation is challenging. As varicella disease is not notifiable, notification criteria and rates vary between countries. In general, existing surveillance systems do not capture cases that do not seek medical care, and most are affected by underreporting and underascertainment. We aimed to estimate the overall varicella disease burden in Europe to provide critical information to support decision-making regarding varicella vaccination.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify all available epidemiological data on varicella IgG antibody seroprevalence, primary care and hospitalisation incidence, and mortality. We then developed methods to estimate age-specific varicella incidence and annual number of cases by different levels of severity (cases in the community, health care seekers in primary care and hospitals, and deaths) for all countries belonging to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) region and Switzerland.
RESULTS: In the absence of universal varicella immunization, the burden of varicella would be substantial with a total of 5.5 million (95% CI: 4.7-6.4) varicella cases occurring annually across Europe. Variation exists between countries but overall the majority of cases (3 million; 95% CI: 2.7-3.3) would occur in children <5 years. Annually, 3-3.9 million patients would consult a primary care physician, 18,200-23,500 patients would be hospitalised, and 80 varicella-related deaths would occur (95% CI: 19-822).
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella disease burden is substantial. Most cases occur in children <5 years old but adults require hospitalisation more often and are at higher risk of death. This information should be considered when planning and evaluating varicella control strategies. A better understanding of the driving factors of country-specific differences in varicella transmission and health care utilization is needed. Improving and standardizing varicella surveillance in Europe, as initiated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), is important to improve data quality to facilitate inter-country comparison.","['Riera-Montes M', 'Bollaerts K', 'Heininger U', 'Hens N', 'Gabutti G', 'Gil A', 'Nozad B', 'Mirinaviciute G', 'Flem E', 'Souverain A', 'Verstraeten T', 'Hartwig S']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Riera-Montes M, et al.

28514943,Sex differences underlying orofacial varicella zoster associated pain in rats.,"BACKGROUND: Most people are initially infected with varicella zoster virus (VZV) at a young age and this infection results in chickenpox. VZV then becomes latent and reactivates later in life resulting in herpes zoster (HZ) or ""shingles"". Often VZV infects neurons of the trigeminal ganglia to cause ocular problems, orofacial disease and occasionally a chronic pain condition termed post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). To date, no model has been developed to study orofacial pain related to varicella zoster. Importantly, the incidence of zoster associated pain and PHN is known to be higher in women, although reasons for this sex difference remain unclear. Prior to this work, no animal model was available to study these sex-differences. Our goal was to develop an orofacial animal model for zoster associated pain which could be utilized to study the mechanisms contributing to this sex difference.
METHODS: To develop this model VZV was injected into the whisker pad of rats resulting in IE62 protein expression in the trigeminal ganglia; IE62 is an immediate early gene in the VZV replication program.
RESULTS: Similar to PHN patients, rats showed retraction of neurites after VZV infection. Treatment of rats with gabapentin, an agent often used to combat PHN, ameliorated the pain response after whisker pad injection. Aversive behavior was significantly greater for up to 7 weeks in VZV injected rats over control inoculated rats. Sex differences were also seen such that ovariectomized and intact female rats given the lower dose of VZV showed a longer affective response than male rats. The phase of the estrous cycle also affected the aversive response suggesting a role for sex steroids in modulating VZV pain.

28488996,"Assessing varicella vaccine effectiveness and its influencing factors using health insurance claims data, Germany, 2006 to 2015.","In Germany, routine childhood varicella vaccination was implemented in 2004 with two doses recommended since 2009. We used an immunisation information system based on countrywide health insurance claims data to analyse vaccine effectiveness (VE) and factors influencing VE. We applied proportional hazard models to estimate VE under various conditions and compared the risk of acquiring varicella among unvaccinated children in regions with high vs low vaccination coverage (VC). Among 1.4 million children we identified 29,404 varicella cases over a maximum follow-up of 8 years post-vaccination. One-dose VE was 81.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 81.4-82.5), two-dose VE 94.4% (95% CI: 94.2-94.6). With dose one given 1-27 days after measles-containing vaccine (MCV), one-dose VE was 32.2% (95% CI: 10.4-48.6), two-dose VE 92.8% (95% CI: 84.8-96.6). VE was not associated with age at vaccination (11-14 vs ≥ 15 months), time since vaccination, or vaccine type. Unvaccinated children had a twofold higher risk of acquiring varicella in low VC regions. Our system generated valuable data, showing that two-dose varicella vaccination provides good protection for at least 8 years. Unvaccinated children benefit from herd effects. When the first varicella vaccine dose is given shortly after MCV, a second dose is essential.","['Rieck T', 'Feig M', 'An der Heiden M', 'Siedler A', 'Wichmann O']",2017,22,17,Euro Surveill,"Rieck T, et al.

28487494,The varicella vaccination pattern among children under 5 years old in selected areas in China.,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine is the most effective way to protect susceptible children from varicella. Few published literature or reports on varicella vaccination of Chinese children exist. Thus, in order to obtain specific information on varicella vaccination of this population, we conducted this survey.
METHODOLOGY: We first used purposive sampling methods to select 6 provinces 10 counties from eastern, middle and western parts of China with high quality of Immunization Information Management System (IIMS), and then randomly select children from population in the IIMS, then we checked vaccination certificate on-site.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Based on the varicella vaccination information collected from 481 children's vaccination certificates from all ten selected counties in China, overall coverage of the first dose of varicella vaccine was 73.6%. There is a positive linear correlation between per capita GDP and vaccine coverage at county level (r=0.929, P < 0.01). The cumulative vaccine coverage among children at 1 year, 2 years and ≥3 years old were 67.6%, 71.9% and 73.6% respectively (X2=4.53, P =0.10). The age of vaccination was mainly concentrated in 12-17 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The coverage rate of the first dose of varicella vaccine in selected areas was lower than that recommended by WHO position paper. The coverage rate was relatively low in areas of low social-economic status. The cumulative coverage had no significant statistical difference among different age group. Most children received varicella vaccine before 3 years old. We suggest introducing the varicella vaccine into routine immunization program, to ensure universal high coverage among children in China. We also suggest that varicella vaccination information should be checked before entering school, in order to control and prevent varicella outbreaks in schools.","['Yue C', 'Li Y', 'Wang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Cao L', 'Zhu X', 'Martin K', 'Wang H', 'An Z']",2017,8,28,Oncotarget,"Yue C, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study which included 69 immunocompetent patients with chickenpox who were addmited to Clinic for infectious disease, Clinical Center University of Sarajevo, in a 18 month period. All patients were divided into two groups depending on clinical presentation on admission. Patients with mild clinical form were dedicated to ""outpatient"" group, and patients with moderate, severe or life-threatening clinical forms were dedicated to ""hospitalized"" group. Also 30 healthy volunteers are included in study as a control group. We analyzed values of CD4+, CD8+ percentage, CD4/CD8 ratio with comparison to clinical course of chickenpox. All specimens were taken in acute phase of illness.
RESULTS: Values of CD4+ percentage were significantly declined in a group of hospitalized patients, compared to group of outpatients and control group. Values of CD8+ percentage were higher in a group of hospitalized patients, while CD4/CD8 values were lower in comparison to a group of outpatients and control group.

28481678,Herpes zoster vaccine: A health economic evaluation for Switzerland.,"Herpes zoster (HZ) or ""shingles"" results from a reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) acquired during primary infection (chickenpox) and surviving in the dorsal root ganglia. In about 20% of cases, a complication occurs, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). A live attenuated vaccine against VZV is available for the prevention of HZ and subsequent PHN. The present study aims to update an earlier evaluation estimating the cost-effectiveness of the HZ vaccine from a Swiss third party payer perspective. It takes into account updated vaccine prices, a different age cohort, latest clinical data and burden of illness data. A Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime consequences of vaccinating 15% of the Swiss population aged 65-79 y. Information from sentinel data, official statistics and published literature were used. Endpoints assessed were number of HZ and PHN cases, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs of hospitalizations, consultations and prescriptions. Based on a vaccine price of CHF 162, the vaccination strategy accrued additional costs of CHF 17,720,087 and gained 594 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was CHF 29,814 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were most sensitive to epidemiological inputs, utility values, discount rates, duration of vaccine efficacy, and vaccine price. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated a more than 99% chance that the ICER was below 40,000 CHF per QALY. Findings were in line with existing cost-effectiveness analyses of HZ vaccination. This updated study supports the value of an HZ vaccination strategy targeting the Swiss population aged 65-79 y.","['Blank PR', 'Ademi Z', 'Lu X', 'Szucs TD', 'Schwenkglenks M']",2017,13,7,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Blank PR, et al.

28479176,Cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccine against herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia for elderly in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: The extended use of varicella vaccine in adults aged 50 and older against herpes zoster (HZ) was recently approved in Japan, which has raised the need to evaluate its value for money.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the efficiency of varicella vaccine immunisation programme for the elderly in Japan. Four strategies with different ages to receive a shot of vaccine were set, namely: (1) 65-84, (2) 70-84, (3) 75-84 and (4) 80-84years old (y.o.). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with no programme from societal perspective were calculated. The health statuses following the target cohort are as follows: without any HZ-related disease, acute HZ followed by recovery, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) followed by recovery, post HZ/PHN, and general death. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disease treatment costs were either calculated or cited from literature. Costs of per course of vaccination were assumed at ¥10,000 (US$91). The model with one-year cycle runs until the surviving individual reached 100 y.o.
RESULTS: ICERs ranged from ¥2,812,000/US$25,680 to ¥3,644,000/US$33,279 per QALY gained, with 65-84 y.o. strategy having the lowest ICER and 80-84 y.o. strategy the highest. None of the alternatives was strongly dominated by the other, while 80-84 y.o. and 70-84 y.o. strategy were extendedly dominated by 65-84 y.o.
STRATEGY: Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the probabilities that ICER is under ¥5,000,000/US$45,662 per QALY gained was at 100% for 65-84 y.o., 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o. strategy, respectively, and at 98.4% for 80-84 y.o.
CONCLUSION: We found that vaccinating individuals aged 65-84, 70-84, 75-84, and 80-84 with varicella vaccine to prevent HZ-associated disease in Japan can be cost-effective from societal perspective, with 65-84 y.o. strategy as the optimal alternative.

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive and systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies related to vaccination and government immunisation programmes in Hong Kong published from 1990 to 2015, through database search of Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and OVID Medline. Methodological quality of selected studies was assessed using Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist (CHEERS). Decision making of vaccination was obtained from Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) and Department of Health in Hong Kong.
RESULTS: Nine eligible studies reporting twelve comparative cost-effectiveness comparisons of vaccination programme for influenza (n=2), pneumococcal disease (n=3), influenza plus pneumococcal disease (n=1), chickenpox (n=2), Haemophilus influenzae b (n=1), hepatitis A (n=1), cervical cancer (n=1) and rotavirus (n=1) were identified. Ten comparisons (83.3%) calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a vaccination strategy versus status quo as outcomes in terms of cost in USD per life-years, cost per quality-adjusted life-years, or cost per disability-adjusted life-years. Among those 10 comparisons in base-case scenario, 4 evaluated interventions were cost-saving relative to status quo while the ICER estimates in 3 of the 6 remaining comparisons were far below commonly accepted threshold and WHO willingness-to-pay threshold, suggestive of very cost-effective. Seven studies were of good quality based on the CHEERS checklist; one was of moderate quality; and one was of excellent quality. The common methodological problems were characterisation of heterogeneity and reporting of study parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a paucity of cost-effectiveness models evaluating vaccination targeted to the Hong Kong population. All evaluated vaccinations and immunisation interventions in Hong Kong, except for Haemophilus influenzae b, hepatitis A and HPV vaccinations, were considered either cost-saving or very cost-effective when compared to status quo.","['Wong CKH', 'Liao Q', 'Guo VYW', 'Xin Y', 'Lam CLK']",2017,35,24,Vaccine,"Wong CKH, et al.

The aim of this perspective paper is to describe the authors' experience in the design and conduct of twelve PASS that contributed to the evaluation of the benefit-risk of vaccines in real-world settings. We describe challenges and learnings from selected PASS of rotavirus, malaria, influenza, human papillomavirus and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccines that assessed or identified potential or theoretical risks, which may lead to changes to risk management plans and/or to label updates. Study settings include the use of large healthcare databases and de novo data collection. PASS methodology is influenced by the background incidence of the outcome of interest, vaccine uptake, availability and quality of data sources, identification of the at-risk population and of suitable comparators, availability of validated case definitions, and the frequent need for case ascertainment in large databases. Challenges include the requirement for valid exposure and outcome data, identification of, and access to, adequate data sources, and mitigating limitations including bias and confounding. Assessing feasibility is becoming a key step to confirm that study objectives can be met in a timely manner. PASS provide critical information for regulators, public health agencies, vaccine manufacturers and ultimately, individuals. Collaborative approaches and synergistic efforts between vaccine manufacturers and key stakeholders, such as regulatory and public health agencies, are needed to facilitate access to data, and to drive optimal study design and implementation, with the aim of generating robust evidence.","['Cohet C', 'Rosillon D', 'Willame C', 'Haguinet F', 'Marenne MN', 'Fontaine S', 'Buyse H', 'Bauchau V', 'Baril L']",2017,35,23,Vaccine,"Cohet C, et al.

During Reye syndrome most important is deficiency of carnitine and hepatocyte damage. Decreased amount of carnitine impairs the energy function of mitochondria and gluconeogenesis as well as production of urea. As a result develops toxic encephalopathy and liver insufficiency. The goal of the research was assessment of efficacy of L-Carnitine, Corvitin and their combination on functional state of liver in experimental model of Reye Syndrome in rats. The study was performed on mature white male Wistar rates with body mass 150-180g. 50 rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (10 rats in each group). The model of Reye syndrome was induced in accordance with A.Vengersky's method. Intraperitoneal administration of 4-pentenoic acid was performed once daily during seven days, the used dosage was 20mg/kg. The treatment of toxic hepatitis was carried with intraperitoneal administration of L-Carnitine 300mg/kg, Corvitine 100mg/kg and concurrent administration of these drugs. Monotherapy with Corvitin and L-Carnitin successfully improved liver function and equally decreased indicators of hepatocyte's cytolyses and increased levels of glucose and urea. The markers of cholestasis was slightly more improved during use of L-Carnitine. Simultaneous use of both drugs was effective in rats with Reye syndrome, indicators of liver damage normalized and herewith, no mortality outcome was observed. The most pronounced hepatoprotective effect of concurrent administration of L-Carnitine and Corvitin may be due to synergic action of these drugs and such regime can be recommended for correction of liver function during Reye syndrome.","['Ghonghadze M', 'Antelava N', 'Liluashvili K', 'Okujava M', 'Pachkoria K']",2017,,263,Georgian Med News,"Ghonghadze M, et al.

28439065,Multidisciplinary study of the secondary immune response in grandparents re-exposed to chickenpox.,"Re-exposure to chickenpox may boost varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunity in the elderly. This secondary immune response is hypothesized to confer protection against herpes zoster. We longitudinally sampled 36 adults over the course of one year after re-exposure to chickenpox. The resulting 183 samples and those of 14 controls were assessed for VZV-specific T-cell immunity and antibody titres. The percentages of VZV-specific CD4+ IL-2-producing T-cells were increased in re-exposed grandparents compared to control participants up to 9 months after re-exposure. Using a longitudinal mixture modelling approach, we found that 25% and 17% of re-exposed grandparents showed a boosting of VZV-specific CD4+ IL-2-producing T-cells and VZV-specific antibodies, respectively. The antibody boosting occurred exclusively in cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG-positive participants. CMV IgG-positive participants also had higher VZV IE62-specific CD4+ IFN-γ-producing T-cell percentages and VZV-specific antibody titres. The protective effect of re-exposure to chickenpox is likely limited, as boosting only occurred in 17-25% of the VZV re-exposed grandparents and for less than one year.","['Ogunjimi B', 'Van den Bergh J', 'Meysman P', 'Heynderickx S', 'Bergs K', 'Jansens H', 'Leuridan E', 'Vorsters A', 'Goossens H', 'Laukens K', 'Cools N', 'Van Tendeloo V', 'Hens N', 'Van Damme P', 'Smits E', 'Beutels P']",2017,7,1,Sci Rep,"Ogunjimi B, et al.

28433331,[Decrease in the incidence of chickenpox in the Community of Madrid after universal childhood immunization. Years 2001-2015].,"OBJECTIVE: Varicella vaccine was recommended in the Community of Madrid (CM) at 15months of age between November 2006 and December 2013. The objective was to describe the impact of vaccination on the incidence of varicella in the CM during the period 2001-2015.
DESIGN: A descriptive study of cases of varicella reported to the Sentinel Physician Network of the CM and the cases recorded in the Minimum Basic Data Set at hospital discharge was carried out. Total incidence of cases and of hospital admissions were calculated, as well as specific incidence by age and sex.
RESULTS: The incidence was 94.0% lower between 2012 and 2013 than between 2001 and 2003. Between 2014 and 2015 the incidence was 61.8% higher than between 2012 and 2013. The highest incidence was observed in children aged 0 to 4years except for 2010-2014, which was exceeded by the incidence in children aged 5 to 9. The trend in hospital admissions was also decreasing, with the highest incidence in children aged 0 to 1year, followed by 1-4years.
CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant decrease in the incidence of cases and of hospital admissions by varicella in all age groups after the recommendation to vaccinate at 15months of age, which is compatible with the effectiveness of a dose and its ability to produce immunity group. The withdrawal of this recommendation between 2014 and 2015 has led to an increase in the incidence.","['García Comas L', 'Latasa Zamalloa P', 'Alemán Vega G', 'Ordobás Gavín M', 'Arce Arnáez A', 'Rodero Garduño I', 'Estirado Gómez A', 'Marisquerena EI']",2018,50,1,Aten Primaria,"García Comas L, et al.

28412076,Varicella vaccination elicits a humoral and cellular response in children with rheumatic diseases using immune suppressive treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess humoral and cellular responses to live-attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccination of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) or juvenile scleroderma (JScle) compared to those of healthy controls (HC).
METHODS: Before, 4-6weeks and one year after VZV vaccination, blood samples of patients and HC were collected. VZV-specific antibody concentrations were measured by ELISA and multiplex immune-assay. IFN-γ ELISpot assays were performed to assess VZV-specific T-cell responses. Cytokine production upon VZV stimulation were measured with a Luminex-assay.
RESULTS: 49 patients (39 JIA, 5 JDM, 5 JScle) and 18 HC were included. All patients used methotrexate (MTX), 16 also used corticosteroids, 3 patients used biologics. No disease flares were reported after vaccination. Antibody response to the vaccine was similar in patients and controls (p=0.139). Use of immunosuppressive drugs did not affect the response (p=0.203). A second vaccination (n=21) increased VZV-specific antibody concentrations (p=0.02). VZV-specific T-cells increased after vaccination (p=0.043), with a cytokine profile suggesting a VZV-specific Th1 and cytotoxic T-cell response.
CONCLUSION: The humoral response to VZV vaccination in patients with pediatric rheumatic diseases (PRD) is similar to that of HC. Generally, patients are able to mount a VZV-specific cellular response.

28408118,A novel combined vaccine based on monochimeric VLP co-displaying multiple conserved epitopes against enterovirus 71 and varicella-zoster virus.,"Chicken pox and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) are two major infectious diseases that mainly affect infants and children, causing significant morbidity annually. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and enterovirus 71 (EV71), respectively, are the principal epidemic pathogens causing these two diseases. To investigate the possibility of developing a novel combined vaccine to prevent chicken pox and HFMD, we constructed three chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) (termed HBc-V/1/2, HBc-2/V/1 and HBc-1/2/V) based on the hepatitis B core antigen (HBc) carrier that display epitopes derived from VZV-gE, EV71-VP1, and EV71-VP2 in a varied tandem manner. The chimeric HBc can self-assemble into VLPs with these three epitopes displayed on the surface of particles. Epitope-specific antibody characterization suggested that HBc-V/1/2 elicits a balanced antibody response toward these three epitopes, and no immune interference was observed between the three epitopes. Importantly, the anti-HBc-V/1/2 sera could simultaneously neutralize VZV and EV71 and cross-neutralize coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), another major pathogen causing HFMD. Moreover, the anti-HBc-V/1/2 sera protected neonatal mice from lethal challenge of EV71 and CVA16. Collectively, our study not only demonstrated that HBc-V/1/2 is a promising candidate combined vaccine for HFMD and Chicken pox but also provides a novel strategy for the design of combined vaccines.","['Wu Y', 'Zhu R', 'Xu L', 'Li Y', 'Li S', 'Yu H', 'Li S', 'Zhu H', 'Cheng T', 'Xia N']",2017,35,20,Vaccine,"Wu Y, et al.

We investigated the cumulative incidence of VZV infection after allogeneic HCT in children receiving a shorter duration of acyclovir prophylaxis than recommended and evaluated the appropriateness of the short duration of acyclovir prophylaxis.Medical records of 217 children who received allogeneic HCT were retrospectively reviewed until a median of 25 months (range = 1-59 months) after HCT. Acyclovir prophylaxis was given for a median of 9 weeks (range = 3-24 weeks) after HCT.VZV infection was diagnosed in 33 (15.2%) children at a median time of 5 months (range = 2-41 months) after HCT. The 1-year and 2-year cumulative incidences of VZV infection after allogeneic HCT were 11.2% and 15.5%, respectively. These incidences were between the previously reported 1-year incidence of 25% to 30% in patients not receiving prophylaxis and 1-year incidence of 4% to 5% in patients receiving ≥1 year duration of prophylaxis.

Herpes zoster can afflict the elderly with a debilitating condition, postherpetic neuralgia, triggering severe, untreatable pain for months or years. The lipid envelope of VZV, similar to all herpesviruses, contains numerous glycoproteins required for replication and pathogenesis.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the current knowledge about VZV glycoproteins and their roles in cell entry, replication and pathogenesis.
RECENT FINDINGS: The functions for some VZV glycoproteins are known, such as gB, gH and gL in membrane fusion, cell-cell fusion regulation, and receptor binding properties. However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger or mediate VZV glycoproteins remains poorly understood.

These measures included vaccination against chickenpox; due to the existence of cases of measles in adjacent regions, it was decided to offer measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination as well. The immunization campaign was performed during 2 d (3 to 4 d after the first case). The immunity status of 1,041 (73,1%) of the residents was reviewed. Being vaccinated 523 (67%) against chickenpox and MMR, 133 (17%) against only MMR and 124 (16%) against only chickenpox.

28359621,Varicella seroepidemiology in United States air force recruits: A retrospective cohort study comparing immunogenicity of varicella vaccination and natural infection.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) produces lifelong immunity, but duration of post-vaccination immunity has not been established. The purpose of this study is to determine if a difference exists in the long-term seropositivity of anti-VZV antibodies in a cohort of young adults who were vaccinated against varicella as compared to a similar cohort with a history of chickenpox disease, and to determine which variables best predict waning seropositivity following varicella vaccination.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study captures immunization and serology data from approximately 10,000 recruits who entered basic military training between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2015, and who have childhood immunization records in the Air Force Aeromedical Services Information Management System. Varicella vaccine immunogenicity was determined relative to the immunogenicity of chickenpox disease, as measured by multiplex flow immunoassay. Among vaccine recipients, waning seroimmunity was modeled and adjusted for several important covariates.
RESULTS: Basic military trainees who received varicella vaccine in childhood were 24% less likely to be seropositive to VZV than trainees who were exempt from vaccine due to a history of chickenpox disease. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between male and female trainees. The odds of a vaccinated trainee being seropositive to VZV decreased by 8% with each year elapsed since vaccination. Seroprevalence declined below estimated herd immunity thresholds in vaccinated trainees born after 1994, and in the cohort as a whole for trainees born after 1995.
CONCLUSION: Despite prior vaccination, seroimmunity in a large cohort of young adults unexposed to wild-type VZV failed to meet the estimated threshold for herd immunity. If vaccination in accordance with the current US VZV vaccination schedule is inadequate to maintain herd immunity, young adults not previously exposed to wild-type VZV may be at increased risk for varicella outbreaks.","['Duncan JR', 'Witkop CT', 'Webber BJ', 'Costello AA']",2017,35,18,Vaccine,"Duncan JR, et al.

28356891,Variable Effects of Autophagy Induction by Trehalose on Herpesviruses Depending on Conditions of Infection.,"Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar formed from two glucose units. Trehalose induces abundant autophagy in cultured cells and also reduces the rate of aggregation of the huntingtin protein in the animal model of Huntington disease, a chronic neurological disease in humans. The mechanism of this effect on autophagy is now known to be caused by starvation secondary to inhibition of a family of glucose transporters known as the solute carrier 2 or the glucose transporter family. Variable effects of trehalose treatment have been observed during infections with two herpesviruses-human cytomegalovirus and varicella-zoster virus. The reasons for differing results have now been delineated. These differences are caused by two variables in conditions of infection: timing of addition of trehalose and type of inoculum (cell-free virus vs. infected cells). When monolayers pretreated with trehalose were inoculated with cell-free virus, there was a decline in virus spread by as much as 93 percent when compared with untreated monolayers. However, when monolayers were inoculated with infected cells rather than cell-free virus, there was no decline in virus spread. These results demonstrated that the effect of trehalose was limited to monolayers that were starved when inoculated with cell-free virus. In contrast, sufficient virus was already present in infected cell inocula so as to minimize any inhibitory effect of a starved monolayer. These results also showed that trehalose did not specifically inhibit a herpesvirus; rather, addition of trehalose to cell culture media altered the intracellular environment.","['Meier JL', 'Grose C']",2017,90,1,Yale J Biol Med,Meier JL and Grose C.

28356523,ORF7 of Varicella-Zoster Virus Is Required for Viral Cytoplasmic Envelopment in Differentiated Neuronal Cells.,"Although a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine has been used for many years, the neuropathy caused by VZV infection is still a major health concern. Open reading frame 7 (ORF7) of VZV has been recognized as a neurotropic gene in vivo, but its neurovirulent role remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ORF7 deletion on VZV replication cycle at virus entry, genome replication, gene expression, capsid assembly and cytoplasmic envelopment, and transcellular transmission in differentiated neural progenitor cells (dNPCs) and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (dSY5Y) cells. Our results demonstrate that the ORF7 protein is a component of the tegument layer of VZV virions. Deleting ORF7 did not affect viral entry, viral genome replication, or the expression of typical viral genes but clearly impacted cytoplasmic envelopment of VZV capsids, resulting in a dramatic increase of envelope-defective particles and a decrease in intact virions. The defect was more severe in differentiated neuronal cells of dNPCs and dSY5Y. ORF7 deletion also impaired transmission of ORF7-deficient virus among the neuronal cells. These results indicate that ORF7 is required for cytoplasmic envelopment of VZV capsids, virus transmission among neuronal cells, and probably the neuropathy induced by VZV infection.IMPORTANCE The neurological damage caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is commonly manifested as clinical problems. Thus, identifying viral neurovirulent genes and characterizing their functions are important for relieving VZV related neurological complications. ORF7 has been previously identified as a potential neurotropic gene, but its involvement in VZV replication is unclear. In this study, we found that ORF7 is required for VZV cytoplasmic envelopment in differentiated neuronal cells, and the envelopment deficiency caused by ORF7 deletion results in poor dissemination of VZV among neuronal cells. These findings imply that ORF7 plays a role in neuropathy, highlighting a potential strategy to develop a neurovirulence-attenuated vaccine against chickenpox and herpes zoster and providing a new target for intervention of neuropathy induced by VZV.","['Jiang HF', 'Wang W', 'Jiang X', 'Zeng WB', 'Shen ZZ', 'Song YG', 'Yang H', 'Liu XJ', 'Dong X', 'Zhou J', 'Sun JY', 'Yu FL', 'Guo L', 'Cheng T', 'Rayner S', 'Zhao F', 'Zhu H', 'Luo MH']",2017,91,12,J Virol,"Jiang HF, et al.

To further control school-based outbreaks and decrease incidence, a 2-dose vaccination was implemented in 2013. We described the varicella epidemiology and assessed impact of the 2-dose vaccination in Haidian district, Beijing, 2007-2015.
METHODS: We examined the estimated incidence and disease characteristics of varicella during 2007-2015 and obtained the 1-dose vaccination coverage for children born during 2005-2013. Number of vaccine doses given was used to indirectly reflect the second-dose vaccination coverage. Overall and age-specific estimated incidences were compared between 2007-2012 and 2013-2015.
RESULTS: A total of 23,497 cases were reported during 2007-2015. Of the 23,497 cases, 13,440 (57.20%) were male, and 68.40% were <20years of age and 70.02% were students and children in kindergarten. The estimated incidence increased from 82 cases per 100,000 population in 2007 to 104 in 2011, before substantially decreasing from 86 in 2012 to 56 in 2015. The median age increased from 14years in 2007 to 18years in 2015. The 1-dose varicella coverage for children at ≥2years of age gradually increased from 74.21% in 2007 to 90.06% in 2015. Compared with 2007-2012, two-fold average vaccine doses were given during 2013-2015, and the overall estimated incidence declined by 34.4%, particularly in children aged 5-9years, with a significantly declined trend in children aged 1-9years and older adolescents aged 15-19years and non-significantly declined trend in adults aged ≥20years, but a significant increasing trend in infants.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of varicella has decreased substantially in Haidian district since 2013, with largest decline in children aged 5-9years. The 2-dose varicella vaccination might not lead to increase in incidence in adults. Long-term surveillance is needed to fully evaluate the long-term impact of the 2-dose varicella vaccination.","['Fu J', 'Jiang C', 'Wang J', 'Zhao F', 'Ma T', 'Shi R', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang X']",2017,35,18,Vaccine,"Fu J, et al.

Little is known about the epidemiology of CMV and EBV infections in contemporary UK paediatric populations, particularly whether age at infection differs by ethnic group.
METHODS: Children enrolled in the Born in Bradford Allergy and Infection Study had a blood sample taken and a questionnaire completed at 12 and 24 months of age. Ordered logistic regression quantified associations between ethnicity and other risk factors and age at CMV/EBV/VZV infection (<12 months, 12-24 months, uninfected at 24 months).
RESULTS: Pakistani children (n = 472) were more likely to be infected with CMV and EBV at a younger age than White British children (n = 391) (CMV: adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-4.33; EBV: adjusted OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.43-3.26). Conversely, Pakistani children had lower odds of being VZV infected in the second year than White British children (adjusted OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.97). There was a strong association between increasing birth order and later CMV infection in Pakistani children.
CONCLUSIONS: We report large differences in CMV and EBV incidence in the first 2 years between Pakistani and White British children born in Bradford, which cannot be explained by differences in risk factors for infection.

28287424,Keloid and Hypertrophic Scars Are the Result of Chronic Inflammation in the Reticular Dermis.,"Keloids and hypertrophic scars are caused by cutaneous injury and irritation, including trauma, insect bite, burn, surgery, vaccination, skin piercing, acne, folliculitis, chicken pox, and herpes zoster infection. Notably, superficial injuries that do not reach the reticular dermis never cause keloidal and hypertrophic scarring. This suggests that these pathological scars are due to injury to this skin layer and the subsequent aberrant wound healing therein. The latter is characterized by continuous and histologically localized inflammation. As a result, the reticular layer of keloids and hypertrophic scars contains inflammatory cells, increased numbers of fibroblasts, newly formed blood vessels, and collagen deposits. Moreover, proinflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α are upregulated in keloid tissues, which suggests that, in patients with keloids, proinflammatory genes in the skin are sensitive to trauma. This may promote chronic inflammation, which in turn may cause the invasive growth of keloids. In addition, the upregulation of proinflammatory factors in pathological scars suggests that, rather than being skin tumors, keloids and hypertrophic scars are inflammatory disorders of skin, specifically inflammatory disorders of the reticular dermis. Various external and internal post-wounding stimuli may promote reticular inflammation. The nature of these stimuli most likely shapes the characteristics, quantity, and course of keloids and hypertrophic scars. Specifically, it is likely that the intensity, frequency, and duration of these stimuli determine how quickly the scars appear, the direction and speed of growth, and the intensity of symptoms. These proinflammatory stimuli include a variety of local, systemic, and genetic factors. These observations together suggest that the clinical differences between keloids and hypertrophic scars merely reflect differences in the intensity, frequency, and duration of the inflammation of the reticular dermis. At present, physicians cannot (or at least find it very difficult to) control systemic and genetic risk factors of keloids and hypertrophic scars. However, they can use a number of treatment modalities that all, interestingly, act by reducing inflammation. They include corticosteroid injection/tape/ointment, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, compression therapy, stabilization therapy, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy, and surgical methods that reduce skin tension.",['Ogawa R'],2017,18,3,Int J Mol Sci,Ogawa R.

28278415,"Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance inaugural annual report, 2014.","INTRODUCTION: The Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) network is a hospital-based active surveillance system employing prospective case ascertainment of selected uncommon vaccine preventable diseases and potential adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). PAEDS enhances other Australian surveillance systems by providing prospective detailed clinical and laboratory data for the same child.
METHODS: Specialist surveillance nurses screen hospital admissions, emergency department records, laboratory and other data, to prospectively identify hospitalised children aged under 15 years in 5 paediatric tertiary referral hospitals in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland. Standardised protocols and case definitions are used across all sites. Conditions under surveillance include vaccine preventable diseases: acute flaccid paralysis, varicella, pandemic and seasonal influenza and pertussis, and potential AEFIs: febrile seizures and intussusception. PAEDS also conducts surveillance for acute childhood encephalitis.
RESULTS: Since August 2007, PAEDS has recruited a total of 6,227 hospitalised cases in total, for all conditions. From January to December 2014, there were 1,220 cases recruited across all conditions. Key outcomes include: enhanced acute flaccid paralysis surveillance to reach World Health Organization targets; supporting varicella and influenza vaccination in children; confirmation of a known low risk of febrile seizures following the 1st dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine but no increased risk of febrile seizures after measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine, and a slightly increased risk of developing intussusception 1-7 days after rotavirus vaccination in infants aged less than 3 months. Acute childhood encephalitis data facilitated rapid investigation and response to the enterovirus 71 outbreak in 2013-2014.
CONCLUSIONS: PAEDS provides unique policy-relevant data.

METHODS: From May to June 2015 in the geographic area of Naples (Italy) a random sample of 675 parents of children aged 4-7 years received a self-administered anonymous questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors towards varicella and its vaccination.
RESULTS: A total of 414 parents responded to the questionnaire, for a response rate of 61.3%. A history of varicella was reported in 163 children (39.6%). Only 26.6% parents knew that the vaccine was available and the number of doses and this knowledge was significantly higher in those who had a university degree, in those who had received information on the vaccination from a health care provider, and in those who had vaccinated their child. The perceived utility towards vaccination had a mean value of 5.7. The positive attitude towards the utility of the vaccination was higher in parents with a level of education not higher than middle school, in those who had vaccinated their child, in those who considered the varicella a dangerous disease, and in those who had received information from a health care provider. More than one-third had vaccinated their child. Immunization was more frequent in parents who had knowledge about the vaccination, who beliefs that the immunization was useful, who believed that the disease was not dangerous, and who had not a history of varicella among their children.

28214346,The epidemiological situation of chickenpox in the Silesian voivodeship in the years 2011-2015 in view of data of the situation in Poland.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the availability of preventive vaccination against chickenpox, this form of prevention is rarely used and is not available to the entire population of children. In order to evaluate an acquired immunity against the virus Varicella-Zoster examining of the presence of specific IgG antibodies to VZV in serum or plasma is required. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Śląskie Voivodeship in 2011-2015.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The evaluation of the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in the past five years was based on analysis of data from the bulletin “Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland” for the period 2011-2014 and 2015 data, received from the Provincial Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations. Analysis of the vaccinated population was made on the basis of data available in the bulletin “Vaccinations in Poland” for the period 2011-2014 and 2015 data obtained from the NIPH-PZH. Samples of patients from Śląskie were tested with the use of Novalisa Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) IgG - ELISA (Novatec Immunodiagnostic GMBH, Germany). Samples were delivered to the Laboratory of the Provincial Sanitary and Epidemiological Station in the course of 2011-2015.
RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2015, in Śląskie, 136 094 chickenpox cases were registered (14% of all occurring in Poland). Based on the number of cases, Śląskie is ranked second place, just after Mazowieckie, in which during the same period of time 143 392 illness were registered. The average annual incidence in Śląskie was 591 per 100 thousand residents. Between 2011 and 2015, a total of 360 serum samples were examined. The percentage of positive IgG in each year ranged between 59.6 and 75.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Promoting vaccination and preventing the sick children to contact the healthy ones as well as the protection of adults susceptible to infection can improve the epidemiological situation regarding incidences of chickenpox. Thanks to vaccines the risk of incidence of chickenpox can be reduced or even the incidences can be prevented. Information about acquired immunity, acquired before the pregnancy, allows to take the action in order to protect the mother from getting chickenpox in form of a preventive vaccination.","['Cieślik-Tarkota R', 'Lorenc Z', 'Albertyńska M', 'Rozwadowska B', 'Jasik KP', 'Mendera-Bożek U']",2016,70,4,Przegl Epidemiol,"Cieślik-Tarkota R, et al.

28174201,Safety of Second-Dose Single-Antigen Varicella Vaccine.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In 2006, routine 2-dose varicella vaccination for children was recommended to improve control of varicella. We assessed the safety of second-dose varicella vaccination.
METHODS: We identified second-dose single-antigen varicella vaccine reports in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System during 2006 to 2014 among children aged 4 to 18 years. We analyzed reports by age group (4-6 and 7-18 years), sex, serious or nonserious status, most common adverse events (AEs), and whether other vaccines were administered concomitantly with varicella vaccine. We reviewed serious reports of selected AEs and conducted empirical Bayesian data mining to detect disproportional reporting of AEs.
RESULTS: We identified 14 641 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System reports after second-dose varicella vaccination, with 494 (3%) classified as serious. Among nonserious reports, injection site reactions were most common (48% of children aged 4-6 years, 38% of children aged 7-18 years). The most common AEs among serious reports were pyrexia (31%) for children aged 4 to 6 years and headache (28%) and vomiting (27%) for children aged 7 to 18 years. Serious reports of selected AEs included anaphylaxis (83), meningitis (5), encephalitis (16), cellulitis (52), varicella (6), herpes zoster (6), and deaths (7). One immunosuppressed adolescent was reported with vaccine-strain herpes zoster. Only previously known AEs were reported more frequently after second-dose varicella vaccination compared with other vaccines.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified no new or unexpected safety concerns for second-dose varicella vaccination. Robust safety monitoring remains an important component of the national varicella vaccination program.","['Su JR', 'Leroy Z', 'Lewis PW', 'Haber P', 'Marin M', 'Leung J', 'Woo EJ', 'Shimabukuro TT']",2017,139,3,Pediatrics,"Su JR, et al.

28163456,Outcome of Dermal Grafting in the Management of Atrophic Facial Scars.,"BACKGROUND: Scars over the face are cosmetically and psychologically disturbing. Various techniques have been described and are being practiced in the management of these scars.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to study the safety, effectiveness of using dermal grafts as fillers in the management of facial scars due to acne, chickenpox, trauma or any others.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with atrophic facial scars of varied aetiology and willing for surgery were considered for dermal graft technique. After pre-operative workup, subcision was done 2 weeks before planned surgery. Depending on the type of scar, grafts were inserted using pocket or road railing techniques. Scar improvement was assessed based on patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: Linear scars showed excellent improvement. Acne, varicella and traumatic scars also showed good improvement. However, two patients did not appreciate improvement due to marked surface irregularities as the scars were elevated. They were further subjected to LASER and chemical peel resurfacing.
CONCLUSION: Dermal grafting can be used in the management of any round to oval facial scar which is soft, prominent and at least 4-5 mm across; linear scars at least 2-3 mm across and 3-4 cm in length. However, scars with prominent surface irregularities need further resurfacing techniques along with dermal grafting.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations of the study include small sample size, and only subjective assessment of the scar has been taken into consideration to assess the outcome.","['Shilpa K', 'Sacchidanand S', 'Leelavathy B', 'Shilpashree P', 'Divya G', 'Ranjitha R', 'Lakshmi DV']",2016,9,4,J Cutan Aesthet Surg,"Shilpa K, et al.

28162821,"Safety of live vaccinations on immunosuppressive therapy in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, solid organ transplantation or after bone-marrow transplantation - A systematic review of randomized trials, observational studies and case reports.","BACKGROUND: Live vaccines are generally contraindicated on immunosuppressive therapy due to safety concerns. However, data are limited to corroborate this practice.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the safety of live vaccinations in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) or solid organ transplantation (SOT) on immunosuppressive treatment and in patients after bone-marrow transplantation (BMT).
DATA SOURCES: A search was conducted in electronic databases (Cochrane, Pubmed, Embase) and additional literature was identified by targeted searches.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized trials, observational studies and case reports.
POPULATION: Patients with IMID or SOT on immunosuppressive treatment and BMT patients <2years after transplantation.
INTERVENTION/VACCINATIONS LOOKED AT: Live vaccinations: mumps, measles, rubella (MMR), yellow fever (YF), varicella vaccine (VV), herpes zoster (HZ), oral typhoid, oral polio, rotavirus, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), smallpox.
DATA EXTRACTION: One author performed the data extraction using predefined data fields. It was cross-checked by two other authors.
RESULTS: 7305 articles were identified and 64 articles were included: 40 on IMID, 16 on SOT and 8 on BMT patients. In most studies, the administration of live vaccines was safe. However, some serious vaccine-related adverse events occurred. 32 participants developed an infection with the vaccine strain; in most cases the infection was mild. However, in two patients fatal infections were reported: a patient with RA/SLE overlap who started MTX/dexamethasone treatment four days after the YFV developed a yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) and died. The particular vaccine lot was found to be associated with a more than 20 times risk of YEL-AVD. One infant whose mother was under infliximab treatment during pregnancy received the BCG vaccine at the age of three months and developed disseminated BCG infection and died. An immunogenicity assessment was performed in 43 studies. In most cases the patients developed satisfactory seroprotection rates. In the IMID group, YFV and VV demonstrated high seroconversion rates. MTX and tumor necrosis factor inhibitory therapy appeared to reduce immune responses to VV and HZ vaccine, but not to MMR and YF-revaccination. Seroconversion in SOT and BMT patients showed mostly higher rates for rubella than for measles, mumps and varicella.
LIMITATIONS: Risk of bias was high in the majority of studies since 39 of them were observational and 17 were case series/case reports. Only eight studies were randomized trials. BMT patient numbers included in this review were low.
CONCLUSIONS: Although live vaccinations were safe and sufficiently immunogenic in most studies, some serious reactions and vaccine-related infections were reported in immunosuppressed IMID and SOT patients. Apart from mild vaccine-related infections MMR and VV vaccines were safe when administered less than two years after BMT.
IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Until further data are available, live vaccinations under most immunosuppressive treatments should only be administered after a careful risk benefit assessment of medications and dosages.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 524 midwives and nurses from obstetric, neonatal, and pediatric wards were investigated. Quantitative data analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Overall, 14.7% potentially seronegative respondents were identified. Out of those with a positive history of varicella, 6.56% contracted the disease after starting work, and > 70% had contact with the varicella-zoster virus. Overall, 9.54% of the respondents had a history of varicella, 3.12% were informed about the possibility of immunization, and 1.56% of those with a negative history of the disease were offered a state-funded vaccine. In the same group, the number of vaccinated people amounted to 13.28%, and 26.13% would accept a state-funded vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella may constitute a significant threat to maternal and fetal health at obstetric, neonatal, and pediatric wards, which must be considered when providing care to women in the reproductive age.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 37 scab samples were collected from clinically suspected field cases of sheep pox and goat pox. These samples were collected during (2014-2015) during different outbreaks of sheep pox and goat pox from Hawamdia township of Giza Governorate, Egypt. The samples were subjected to egg inoculation, TEM, and (RPO30) gene-based PCR. By using the egg inoculation: Previously prepared 37 scab samples (n=23 sheep and n=14 goats) were inoculated on the chorioallantoic membrane of specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (12 days old age). In the presence of the suitable percentage of humidity and candling, the inoculated eggs were incubated at 37°C. By using the TEM: Samples showed positive pock lesions on the chorioallantoic membranes, were fixed in glutaraldehyde, then processed and sectioned for TEM. Using the (RPO30) gene-based PCR assay, 30 of positive samples after egg inoculation (n=19 sheep and n=11 goats) were screened.
RESULTS: Using the egg inoculation, a characteristic pock lesions for poxviruses were seen in 30/37 (n=19 sheep and n=11 goats) (81.08%). Using the TEM, examination of the positive samples after egg inoculation revealed positive result in 23/30 (n=15 sheep and n=8 goats) (76.66%). The positive results represented by the presence of negatively stained oval-shape virus particles. Using the (RPO30) gene-based PCR assay, out of 30 total of positive samples after egg inoculation (n=19 sheep and n=11 goats) were screened, 27 (90%) samples (n=17 sheep and n=10 goats) were positive.

28071656,ACG Clinical Guideline: Preventive Care in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Recent data suggest that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients do not receive preventive services at the same rate as general medical patients. Patients with IBD often consider their gastroenterologist to be the primary provider of care. To improve the care delivered to IBD patients, health maintenance issues need to be co-managed by both the gastroenterologist and primary care team. Gastroenterologists need to explicitly inform the primary care provider of the unique needs of the IBD patient, especially those on immunomodulators and biologics or being considered for such therapy. In particular, documentation of up to date vaccinations are crucial as IBD patients are often treated with long-term immune-suppressive therapies and may be at increased risk for infections, many of which are preventable with vaccinations. Health maintenance issues addressed in this guideline include identification, safety and appropriate timing of vaccinations, screening for osteoporosis, cervical cancer, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer as well as identification of depression and anxiety and smoking cessation.

28066065,THE JEREMIAH METZGER LECTURE VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS: FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) gives rise to two diseases, a primary infection, varicella, and a secondary infection, zoster. Morbidity and mortality from VZV in the United States has decreased by 80% to 90% due to the effective use of attenuated live viral vaccines. Because latent VZV continues to reactivate, however, serious VZV-induced disease persists. Newly developed molecular analyses have revealed that zoster is more common than previously realized; moreover, the establishment of VZV latency in neurons, such as those of the enteric nervous system, which do not project to the skin, leads to unexpected, serious, and clandestine manifestations of disease, including perforating gastrointestinal ulcers and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The development of the first animal model of zoster, in guinea pigs, now enables the pathophysiology of latency and reactivation to be analyzed.","['Gershon AA', 'Gershon MD']",2016,127,,Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc,Gershon AA and Gershon MD.

28057380,Current and future vaccines and vaccination strategies against infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) respiratory disease of poultry.,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an economically important respiratory disease of poultry that affects the industry worldwide. Vaccination is the principal tool in the control of the disease. Two types of vaccines, live attenuated and recombinant viral vector, are commercially available. The first generation of GaHV-1 vaccines available since the early 1960's are live viruses, attenuated by continuous passages in cell culture or embryos. These vaccines significantly reduce mortalities and, in particular, the chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines have shown to limit outbreaks of the disease. However, the CEO vaccines can regain virulence and become the source of outbreaks. Recombinant viral vector vaccines, the second generation of GaHV-1 vaccines, were first introduced in the early 2000's. These are Fowl Pox virus (FPV) and Herpes virus of turkeys (HVT) vectors expressing one or multiple GaHV-1 immunogenic proteins. Recombinant viral vector vaccines are considered a much safer alternative because they do not regain virulence. In the face of challenge, they improve bird performance and ameliorate clinical signs of the disease but fail to reduce shedding of the challenge virus increasing the likelihood of outbreaks. At the moment, several new strategies are being evaluated to improve both live attenuated and viral vector vaccines. Potential new live vaccines attenuated by deletion of genes associated with virulence or by selection of CEO viral subpopulations that do not exhibit increased virulence upon passages in birds are being evaluated. Also new vector alternatives to express GaHV-1 glycoproteins in Newcastle diseases virus (NDV) or in modified very virulent (vv) serotype I Marek's disease virus (MDV) were developed and evaluated.",['García M'],2017,206,,Vet Microbiol,García M.

28052217,Prevalence of Molar Incisor Hypomineralization in Mexican Children.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of and factors associated with molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) in schoolchildren aged 6-12 years.
STUDY DESIGN: This study included 1156 schoolchildren aged 6-12 years, living in Mexico City. A previously standardised examiner (k = 0.79) applied the diagnostic criteria for MIH from the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry. Children's parents completed a questionnaire about medical conditions in the perinatal period and the first 3 years of their children's lives. Descriptive measures were examined, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The subjects were 582 (50.4%) females and 574 (49.6%) males, with an average age of 8.4 ± 1.6 years. The prevalence of MIH was 15.8%, and this condition was more prevalent in children aged 9-12 years than in those aged 6-8 years (18% vs. 13.7%, p < 0.05). Risk factors for MIH were low birth weight (OR = 1.905, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.130-3.211, p = 0.014), urinary tract infection (OR = 4.841, 95% CI 2.863-8.186, p = 0.001), chickenpox (OR = 1.826, 95% CI 1.196-2.786, p = 0.005), and history of allergies (OR = 4.370, 95% CI 2.538-7.523, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MIH in a group of Mexican schoolchildren was 15.8%.

A present study was carried out to look for the source of contamination (patient itself) and examine the route of contaminant transfer in the hospital. This article provides recommendation for future work to improve the yield and save the energy consumption simultaneously. The risk of airborne infection can be minimized in hospital wards by using a high air change rate.

It is due to dysfunction of the heart and great vessels during embryo development stage, or the channel was not closed after birth. This study focuses on investigating the influence of virus infection and medicine history during pregnancy on the incidence rate of CHD of fetus. We conducted a retrospective birth cohort study of infant born in the maternal and child health hospital of Fanyu district in Guangzhou. Five thousand three hundred eighty one cases with complete medical records, including mothers, fathers, and infants, were enrolled. The exposure history of mothers to virus and medicine from 6 months before pregnancy to prenatal examination was investigated, including mflu, mumps, measles, rubella, chickenpox, and hepatitis and antibiotics, tocolytic agent, anticonvulsants, antipyretic and analgesic, antitumor drug, folic acid supplement, and contraceptive. The relationship between virus infection and medicine history during pregnancy and CHD was analyzed. There was statistical difference between a normal group and a defected group in influenza infection and tocolytic agent and contraceptive pill. The exposure history to influenza and medicines, such as tocolytic agent and contraceptive pill, during pregnancy influenced the incidence rate of CHD of fetus.","['Liang Q', 'Gong W', 'Zheng D', 'Zhong R', 'Wen Y', 'Wang X']",2017,24,6,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Liang Q, et al.

28017427,The economic impact of prenatal varicella immunity among pregnant women in Alberta.,"In light of the changing epidemiology of varicella, we sought to examine varicella antibody levels in the prenatal population in the Canadian province of Alberta. All prenatal varicella screening tests performed between August 1, 2002 and February 2, 2014 (454,592) were included in this study. Test results, demographics and vaccination status were examined to identify varicella seroprevalence and correlates for being seronegative. An overall seroprevalence for varicella of 95.8% was found across all pregnancy screenings. Significant independent correlates of seronegativity included younger age (AOR: 4.72 (95% CI: 3.87-5.77) for <20years of age vs. >40years of age) and having immigrated to Alberta from Africa or Asia (AOR: 4.55 (95% CI: 4.10-5.05) and AOR: 5.83 (95%CI; 5.48-6.19), respectively). Women who were initially seronegative for varicella antibodies and who received both postnatal vaccination and post-vaccination prenatal screening (2566) were examined to assess seroconversion. 66.3% of women who were tested up to six months post-vaccination were seropositive, however only 36.9% of women tested after 36months were seropositive. Finally, 40.9% of all prenatal varicella specimens tested were deemed redundant, i.e. women had either a history of (1) ⩾2 doses of varicella vaccine, (2) varicella infection, or (3) a previous positive varicella serology. Eliminating this redundant screening could provide an estimated $96,000 in savings annually in laboratory and Public Health follow-up costs alone. As the number of women with vaccine-derived immunity through universal childhood vaccination increase in the prenatal population, screening methods may need to adapt to ensure varicella immunity is accurately conducted and assessed.","['Passi A', 'Plitt SS', 'Lai FY', 'Simmonds K', 'Charlton CL']",2017,35,4,Vaccine,"Passi A, et al.

28012212,Incidence of serum antibody titers against varicella zoster virus in Japanese patients with herpes zoster.,"Herpes zoster is an internal reactivation of varicella zoster virus following establishment of latent infection in the dorsal root ganglia during primary infection, which presents as chickenpox. Therefore, serologically, herpes zoster patients already have anti-varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin G at the onset of disease. Hence, positive serum antibody does not confirm the diagnosis of herpes zoster. We retrospectively investigated the incidence of varicella zoster virus-specific complement fixation in 865 zoster patients at initial presentation to a dermatology clinic. As a result, 66% of patients showed negative complement fixation, with patient numbers decreasing as titer increased. Paired complement fixation tests conducted within a short period showed a marked elevation in titer, and complement fixation titer gradually decreased after a year. Furthermore, incidence showed no correlation with patient age. These observations indicate that the complement fixation titer at first visit is mainly influenced by the duration from onset to presentation at clinic. Our findings indicate that a positive complement fixation result by single-point testing confirms at least recent onset of herpes zoster, while paired tests can confirm disease when primary tests are negative.","['Miyachi M', 'Ihara H', 'Imafuku S']",2017,44,6,J Dermatol,"Miyachi M, et al.

27997521,Laboratory Diagnosis of Breakthrough Varicella in Children.,"BACKGROUND: Breakthrough varicella (BV) develops in vaccinated persons as a result of infection by wild-type varicella-zoster virus more than 42 days after varicella vaccination. The clinical symptoms are atypical, and clinical diagnosis can be difficult. We investigated laboratory-based diagnostic methods that are relatively simple and highly precise to conduct accurate surveillance.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 42 patients with suspected BV at 2 pediatric hospitals and performed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the skin lesions to confirm the BV diagnosis. We performed PCR on saliva and blood collected during the acute phase, as well as direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) imaging on lesions, and measured varicella-zoster virus immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM during the acute and convalescent phases.
RESULTS: We confirmed the BV diagnosis in 31 of 42 enrolled patients. The sensitivity of DFA imaging of the lesion, and PCR of saliva and blood were 93.5%, 87.1% and 61.3%, respectively. IgM was detected in 12.9% of patients during the acute phase and in 65.5% during the convalescent phase. IgG increased more than 4-fold in 86.2% of patients between the acute and convalescent phases. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 83.9% and 81.8%, respectively, when the diagnostic criteria for IgG were set to greater than 20 during the acute phase.
CONCLUSIONS: The gold standard of laboratory-based diagnosis of BV has been the PCR of samples taken from lesions. However, DFA of the lesion showed equivalent sensitivity when compared with PCR. PCR using saliva samples is an effective, noninvasive method of diagnosis. We found that high values of IgG during the acute phase can aid in the diagnosis of BV.","['Watanabe M', 'Ochiai H', 'Ito M', 'Negoro M', 'Suga S', 'Ihara T']",2017,36,6,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Watanabe M, et al.

The aim of our current research was to investigate a) how often people search the Internet for vaccination-related information, b) if this search is spontaneous or induced by media, and c) which kind of information is in particular searched. We used Google Trends (GT) for monitoring the interest for preventable infections and related vaccines. When looking for vaccine preventable infectious diseases, vaccine was not a popular topic, with some valuable exceptions, including the vaccine against Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Vaccines-related queries represented approximately one third of the volumes regarding preventable infections, greatly differing among the vaccines. However, the interest for vaccines is increasing throughout time: in particular, users seek information about possible vaccine-related side-effects. The five most searched vaccines are those against 1) influenza; 2) meningitis; 3) diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus; 4) yellow fever; and 5) chickenpox. ICTs can have a positive influence on parental vaccine-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and vaccination willingness. GT can be used for monitoring the interest for vaccinations and the main information searched.","['Bragazzi NL', 'Barberis I', 'Rosselli R', 'Gianfredi V', 'Nucci D', 'Moretti M', 'Salvatori T', 'Martucci G', 'Martini M']",2017,13,2,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Bragazzi NL, et al.

We analyzed trends in hospitalization rates and characteristics of pediatric oncology and non-oncology patients hospitalized with varicella during the first 7 years after introduction of routine varicella vaccination. Our data included children <17 years of age with an International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) main or secondary discharge diagnosis of varicella identified by annual database queries in 22-29 pediatric hospitals in Bavaria (Germany) in 2005-2011. Of a total of 1,245 varicella-associated hospitalizations, 42 children (median age 4 years, interquartile range 3-5) had an underlying malignancy (67% with acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Overall, additional diagnoses potentially associated with varicella were reported less often in oncology than in non-oncology varicella patients (62% vs. 77%, p = 0.041), suggesting earlier hospitalization of high-risk patients. Acute hematological diagnoses (29% vs. 3%, p < 0.001) and coinfections (invasive 12% vs. 2%, p = 0.001; noninvasive 19% vs. 8%, p = 0.019) were more frequent, whereas neurological (5% vs. 19%, p = 0.023) and upper respiratory tract diagnoses (2% vs. 16%, p = 0.014) were less frequent in oncology compared to non-oncology varicella patients. Oncology varicella patients showed a longer hospital stay (median 5 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001). Hospitalization rates in non-oncology varicella patients declined constantly since 2006, from 114.8 (2006) to 30.5 (2011) per 1,000 pediatric beds. The rates of varicella-associated hospitalizations in oncology patients indicated an overall decreasing trend (3.8, 1.9, 4.6, 3.5, 0.4, 2.1 and 0.6 cases per 1,000 pediatric beds in 2005-2011).

Vaccination of VZV-seronegative patients on the waiting list for renal transplantation may prevent severe disease. However, the immunologic response of end-stage renal disease patients to peptide vaccines is far from optimal. Our question was whether end-stage renal disease patients with undetectable VZV-IgG levels were able to mount an adequate humoral and cellular response to a live attenuated varicella vaccine.
METHODS: Kidney transplant candidates with undetectable VZV levels were vaccinated twice with a live attenuated varicella vaccine at an interval of 6weeks. VZV IgG levels were analysed till 2years after vaccination. The VZV-specific T-cell reactivity was determined prior to vaccination and after transplantation.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent (40/52) of the vaccinees reached positive VZV-IgG levels after vaccination (responders). Eighty-two percent (9/11) showed an increase in VZV-specific CD4

Tropical and subtropical countries have more prevalence of virus associated pathological conditions such as chickenpox, adenovirus related infections, dengue, chickengunya, infectious mononucleosis, etc. Treatment options with effective antiviral drugs are limited and are unfortunately not free from undesirable effects. The Asian Green Mussel, Perna viridis (Linn.) (Mytilidae) are not only important for their evolutionary significance, high caloric index, ecological role in the sequestration of environmental pollutants especially heavy metals, but also are potential source for extraction of therapeutic and bioactive compounds. On the other hand, generally in bivalves, virus mediated mortality is not uncommon. In this study, we made a maiden attempt of exploring DNAse like bioactivity for natural non-protenacious compound(s) extracted from P. viridis. Crude Methanol Extract (CME) of soft tissue of P. viridis and subsequently its partially purified component (PPC) possess exceptional ability to degrade indiscriminately both low and high molecular weight DNAs. In vitro digestions for1, 2 and 3 h with CME and PPC were found to be comparable to commercial (Sigma-Aldrich) enzyme, DNase I. Bioactive assays conducted to evaluate antimicrobial property, have shown that CME and PPC exclusively inhibit viral propagation. Nonetheless, CME & PPC have no effect on the propagation of bacteria (0 mm ZOI). These results indicate the possibility of a source of potential antiviral drug against DNA Group I viruses. Although our study does not provide any data to correlate to any physiological functions of these substances but provides a clue towards an important role in the biology of mussels. Any conclusion at this stage is premature. However, taking into consideration the significantly high virus mediated mortality in bivalves and the antiviral bioactivity of these substances, it appears that mussels have evolved some mechanisms to counteract some viruses.","['Iqbal MZAN', 'Khan MS']",2016,54,12,Indian J Exp Biol,"Iqbal MZAN and Khan MS.

27896784,Ocular involvement associated with varicella in adults.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is a common infectious disease primarily of childhood that is usually benign and self-limited. It is, however, increasingly seen in adults who are at a higher risk of severe infection. Ocular complications of varicella are relatively uncommon and have been rarely described in adults. We describe herein five adults who developed ocular involvement in association with primary varicella-zoster virus infection.
FINDINGS: Ocular manifestations included acute anterior uveitis in four eyes, with associated stromal keratitis in one of them, epithelial ulcerative keratitis in the two eyes of one patient, and acute retinal necrosis in one eye. One patient with acute anterior uveitis was treated with topical steroids and cycloplegic agents. The four other patients received topical or systemic antiviral drugs, with subsequent resolution of acute ocular inflammatory disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of chickenpox-associated ocular complications in adults is wide. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are mandatory to improve visual outcome.","['Gargouri S', 'Khochtali S', 'Zina S', 'Khairallah M', 'Zone-Abid I', 'Kaibi I', 'Ben Yahia S', 'Feki J', 'Khairallah M']",2016,6,1,J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect,"Gargouri S, et al.

Overall, the male/female (M/F) ratio was 80/83, median age at HCT was 54 (range 15-69) years, and autologous/allogeneic HCT (auto/allo-HCT) ratio was 71/92. Forty-four patients [M/F, 25/19; median age, 57 (range: 16-68) years; auto/allo-HCT, 26/18] developed VZV infection after HCT. All cases were successfully treated with acyclovir (ACV) or valacyclovir, and there was no VZV-related death. Nine (20%) of the 44 patients [M/F, 5/4; median age, 58 (range: 21-63) years; auto/allo-HCT, 7/2] developed PHN after resolution of zoster.

27878603,[The epidemiology of varicella disease in Germany after introduction of a vaccination recommendation : Analysis of mandatory and sentinel data between 2002 and 2014].,"BACKGROUND: Since 2004 a single varicella vaccination for all infants aged 11-14 months has been recommended in Germany and since 2009 a second dose at the age of 15-23 months is recommended. Vaccination coverage after 24 months rose from 43% in 2006 to 87.5% in 2012. A mandatory notification system was introduced in the New Federal States (NFS) between 2002 and 2009 and nationwide in 2013. A national sentinel system has been in place since 2005.
OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: We analyzed both data sources to describe the varicella epidemiology related to vaccination coverage after initiation of routine childhood varicella vaccination and to evaluate both notification systems regarding informative value and data quality. We looked at trends, age distribution and incidences using Microsoft Excel and Stata12. Vaccination coverage data were available from health insurance claims data.
RESULTS: By 2013 a decrease of cases/medical practice/month from 3.47 to 0.43 was observed. The incidence in the NFS declined from 32 to 12 out of 100,000. Sentinel and mandatory notification data showed the largest decrease among the 1-4 year-olds (-94 and -90% resp.). In 2014, varicella incidences increased in all age groups, but not the cases/medical-practice/month by age in the sentinel.
DISCUSSION: Increasing vaccination coverage and decreasing varicella cases demonstrate the success of routine childhood varicella vaccination. Mandatory notification data allow incidence calculation; The sentinel system has been providing more detailed information about vaccination status, better data quality and continuous national data since 2005, irrespective of the Infectious disease protection act. Trends and age distribution can be continuously calculated, whereas the nationwide mandatory data collected in the short period since April 2013 can only be evaluated to a limited extent.","['Hecht J', 'Siedler A']",2017,60,1,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,Hecht J and Siedler A.

27855688,Fatal varicella pneumonia in an unvaccinated child with Down Syndrome: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is an acute infectious disease common during childhood. It has mostly an uncomplicated course in early childhood. Neverthless, it may result in severe complications, especially in particular age groups and clinical conditions. Down Syndrome represents a risk factor for developing complications, because of the frequent comorbidities and their immunodeficiency.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old white Caucasian female affected by Down Syndrome was referred to our hospital for cardiac arrest in course of varicella disease. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation and stabilization, her clinical conditions didn't improve and she developed a massive pulmonary hemorrage, which led her to exitus.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality due to varicella infection is rare, but it is more common in subjects with immune deficit or chronic pathologies, and in particular age-groups. The importance of the vaccine for preventable infectious diseases is stressed in this paper, in which we present a case of death in an unvaccinated cardiopathic child with Down Syndrome affected by varicella.","['Valentini D', 'Bianchi S', 'Di Camillo C', 'Vittucci AC', 'Gonfiantini MV', 'De Vito R', 'Villani A']",2016,42,1,Ital J Pediatr,"Valentini D, et al.

27832745,The burden of chickenpox disease in Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: Chickenpox vaccine is not included in the routine childhood vaccination programme in Sweden. The aim of this study was to estimate the baseline of national chickenpox disease burden, as comprehensive studies, required for an assessment regarding vaccine introduction, are lacking.
METHODS: We used available health care registers and databases; the death register, hospitalisations register, communicable disease notifications database, Stockholm County registers on consultations in specialist and primary care, temporary parental benefit to care for a sick child, and searches on the health care system's website. From each data source, records regarding chickenpox were identified and extracted, either using relevant diagnosis codes (ICD-10) or key words. A descriptive analysis with regards to number of cases and incidence, severity, and seasonality, was carried out covering the time period 2007 to 2013.
RESULTS: There were on average 333 patients hospitalised annually due to chickenpox, yielding a hospitalisation rate of 3.56/100,000 person-years. We found a slight male predominance in hospitalised cases. The highest hospitalisation rate was seen in 1 year-olds, whereas the peak in primary care consultations was in 2 year-olds. Nearly a quarter of children had parents who reported absence from work to care for them when sick with chickenpox. The average yearly death rate from chickenpox was 0.034/100,000 person-years. The duration of hospital stay increased with age. The seasonality in number of searches on the health care website corresponded well with hospitalisations and primary care consultations with peaks in spring.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows chickenpox death and hospitalisation rates in range with other European countries without routine vaccination. Swedish children fall ill with chickenpox at a very young age. The study provides essential input for future discussions on the introduction of routine chickenpox vaccination in Sweden.","['Widgren K', 'Giesecke J', 'Lindquist L', 'Tegnell A']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Widgren K, et al.

27811322,Molecular characterization of chicken infectious anemia virus from contaminated live-virus vaccines.,"The aim of this study was to investigate possible causes of the pervasiveness of chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) infection in chickens in recent years in China. A total of 14 batches of live-virus vaccines were examined using PCR to detect CIAV contamination, of which only 2 samples (a Newcastle disease vaccine and a fowl pox vaccine) tested positive for CIAV. These Newcastle and fowl pox vaccines were then inoculated into 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens. Serum samples were collected from chickens infected with the PCR-positive vaccines, and these tested positive for CIAV-specific antibodies as tested using ELISA. In addition, DNA samples isolated from the serum samples also tested positive by PCR. The results indicated that the samples were contaminated with CIAV and identified 2 exogenous CIAV strains, designated CIAV-N22 and CIAV-F10, in the respective samples. The full genome sequences of these novel CIAV strains were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that the CIAV-F10 strain might represent a recombinant viral strain arising from the parental CIAV strains JQ690762 and KJ728816. Overall, the results suggested that vaccination with CIAV-contaminated vaccines contributed to the prevalence and spread of CIAV infection in chickens. Furthermore, the CIAV contaminant was likely subsequently transmitted to commercial chickens through congenital transmission. Our findings therefore highlight the need for more extensive screening of live-virus vaccines for poultry in China to reduce the threat of contamination with exogenous viruses.","['Li Y', 'Hu Y', 'Cui S', 'Fu J', 'Wang Y', 'Cui Z', 'Fang L', 'Chang S', 'Zhao P']",2017,96,5,Poult Sci,"Li Y, et al.

27795427,The Glycoprotein B Cytoplasmic Domain Lysine Cluster Is Critical for Varicella-Zoster Virus Cell-Cell Fusion Regulation and Infection.,"UNLABELLED: The conserved glycoproteins gB and gH-gL are essential for herpesvirus entry and cell-cell fusion induced syncytium formation, a characteristic of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) pathology in skin and sensory ganglia. VZV syncytium formation, which has been implicated in the painful condition of postherpetic neuralgia, is regulated by the cytoplasmic domains of gB (gBcyt) via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and gH (gHcyt). A lysine cluster (K894, K897, K898, and K900) in the VZV gBcyt was identified by sequence alignment to be conserved among alphaherpesviruses, suggesting a functional role. Alanine and arginine substitutions were used to determine if the positive charge and susceptibility to posttranslational modifications of these lysines contributed to gB/gH-gL cell-cell fusion. Critically, the positive charge of the lysine residues was necessary for fusion regulation, as alanine substitutions induced a 440% increase in fusion compared to that of the wild-type gBcyt while arginine substitutions had wild-type-like fusion levels in an in vitro gB/gH-gL cell fusion assay. Consistent with these results, the alanine substitutions in the viral genome caused exaggerated syncytium formation, reduced VZV titers (-1.5 log
IMPORTANCE: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes chickenpox and shingles. Individuals afflicted with shingles risk developing the painful condition of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which has been difficult to treat because the underlying cause is not well understood. Additional therapies are needed, as the current vaccine is not recommended for immunocompromised individuals and its efficacy decreases with the age of the recipient. VZV is known to induce the formation of multinuclear cells in neuronal tissue, which has been proposed to be a factor contributing to PHN. This study examines the role of a lysine cluster in the cytoplasmic domain of the VZV fusion protein, gB, in the formation of VZV induced multinuclear cells and in virus replication kinetics and spread. The findings further elucidate how VZV self-regulates multinuclear cell formation and may provide insight into the development of new PHN therapies.","['Yang E', 'Arvin AM', 'Oliver SL']",2017,91,1,J Virol,"Yang E, et al.

27795423,Dysregulated Glycoprotein B-Mediated Cell-Cell Fusion Disrupts Varicella-Zoster Virus and Host Gene Transcription during Infection.,"UNLABELLED: The highly conserved herpesvirus glycoprotein complex gB/gH-gL mediates membrane fusion during virion entry and cell-cell fusion. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) characteristically forms multinucleated cells, or syncytia, during the infection of human tissues, but little is known about this process. The cytoplasmic domain of VZV gB (gBcyt) has been implicated in cell-cell fusion regulation because a gB[Y881F] substitution causes hyperfusion. gBcyt regulation is necessary for VZV pathogenesis, as the hyperfusogenic mutant gB[Y881F] is severely attenuated in human skin xenografts. In this study, gBcyt-regulated fusion was investigated by comparing melanoma cells infected with wild-type-like VZV or hyperfusogenic mutants. The gB[Y881F] mutant exhibited dramatically accelerated syncytium formation in melanoma cells caused by fusion of infected cells with many uninfected cells, increased cytoskeleton reorganization, and rapid displacement of nuclei to dense central structures compared to pOka using live-cell confocal microscopy. VZV and human transcriptomes were concurrently investigated using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify viral and cellular responses induced when gBcyt regulation was disrupted by the gB[Y881F] substitution. The expression of four vital VZV genes, ORF61 and the genes for glycoproteins gC, gE, and gI, was significantly reduced at 36 h postinfection for the hyperfusogenic mutants. Importantly, hierarchical clustering demonstrated an association of differential gene expression with dysregulated gBcyt-mediated fusion. A subset of Ras GTPase genes linked to membrane remodeling were upregulated in cells infected with the hyperfusogenic mutants. These data implicate gBcyt in the regulation of gB fusion function that, if unmodulated, triggers cellular processes leading to hyperfusion that attenuates VZV infection.
IMPORTANCE: The highly infectious, human-restricted pathogen varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of shingles that manifests as prolonged excruciating pain, which has proven difficult to treat. The formation of fused multinucleated cells in ganglia might be associated with this condition. An effective vaccine against VZV is available but not recommended for immunocompromised individuals, highlighting the need for new therapies. This study investigated the viral and cellular responses to hyperfusion, a condition where the usual constraints of cell membranes are overcome and cells form multinucleated cells. This process hinders VZV and is regulated by a viral glycoprotein, gB. A combination of live-cell imaging and next-generation genomics revealed an alteration in viral and cellular responses during hyperfusion that was caused by the loss of gB regulation. These studies reveal mechanisms central to VZV pathogenesis, potentially leading to improved therapies.","['Oliver SL', 'Yang E', 'Arvin AM']",2017,91,1,J Virol,"Oliver SL, et al.

Due to successful vaccination programmes measles, mumps and congenital rubella syndrome has become neglected in Germany. However, recent outbreaks of measles have occurred from import-associated cases. In this cross-sectional study the serostatus for MMR and VZV in 2013 HIV-positive adults from three different university outpatient clinics in Bonn (n = 544), Cologne (n = 995) and Munich (n = 474) was analysed. Sera were tested for MMR- and VZV-specific immunglobulin G antibodies using commercial immunoassays. Seronegativity was found in 3% for measles, 26% for mumps, 11% for rubella and 2% for VZV. Regarding MMR, 35% of patients lacked seropositivity against at least one infectious agent. In multivariable analysis younger age was strongly associated with seronegativity against all four viruses, measles, mumps, rubella (P < 0·001, P < 0·001 and P = 0·001, respectively) and VZV (P = 0·001). In conclusion, there is high need for MMR and VZV vaccination in people living with HIV in Germany born in 1970 or later.

27771122,[Vaccination status in psoriasis patients on immunosuppressant therapy (including biologics)].,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the vaccine coverage of psoriasis patients prior to initiating or changing immunosuppressant therapy, and to verify that the prescribed vaccines have been administered.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a bi-centre, observational, cross-sectional study over 9 months. Psoriasis patients in whom immunosuppressant therapy (comprising cyclosporine, methotrexate, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab or ustekinumab) was indicated were included. Medical history, previous treatments, vaccination status, viral serology results (for hepatitis B, measles, and chickenpox), and reasons for non-vaccination were assessed via questionnaire.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included. One third brought their immunization records. Overall, 54.4% had already received immunosuppressant therapy; of these, 9 were up to date for influenza and 3 were up to date for pneumococcus. Only one patient was up to date for all of the recommended vaccinations. A total of 61% of patients were seronegative for hepatitis B. The following vaccines were updated: DTP (in 2 patients), DTP-pertussis (12), influenza (22), pneumococcus (45), and hepatitis B (6). None of the three patients with plans to travel to yellow fever-endemic countries had been vaccinated. In all, 53 (78%) stated that they had already had chickenpox and 43 (63.2%) stated that they had had one of the following three diseases: measles, rubella, or mumps. Fifty-two patients were serologically tested for chickenpox, and 98% were immunized. The most common reasons for not updating the immunization schedule were the absence of any notification or proposal by the patient's doctor and oversight.

27769206,"Coverage, efficacy or dosing interval: which factor predominantly influences the impact of routine childhood vaccination for the prevention of varicella? A model-based study for Italy.","BACKGROUND: Varicella is a highly infectious disease with a significant public health and economic burden, which can be prevented with childhood routine varicella vaccination. Vaccination strategies differ by country. Some factors are known to play an important role (number of doses, coverage, dosing interval, efficacy and catch-up programmes), however, their relative impact on the reduction of varicella in the population remains unclear. This paper aims to help policy makers prioritise the critical factors to achieve the most successful vaccination programme with the available budget.
METHODS: Scenarios assessed the impact of different vaccination strategies on reduction of varicella disease in the population. A dynamic transmission model was used and adapted to fit Italian demographics and population mixing patterns. Inputs included coverage, number of doses, dosing intervals, first-dose efficacy and availability of catch-up programmes, based on strategies currently used or likely to be used in different countries. The time horizon was 30 years.
RESULTS: Both one- and two-dose routine varicella vaccination strategies prevented a comparable number of varicella cases with complications, but two-doses provided broader protection due to prevention of a higher number of milder varicella cases. A catch-up programme in susceptible adolescents aged 10-14 years old reduced varicella cases by 27-43 % in older children, which are often more severe than in younger children. Coverage, for all strategies, sustained at high levels achieved the largest reduction in varicella. In general, a 20 % increase in coverage resulted in a further 27-31 % reduction in varicella cases. When high coverage is reached, the impact of dosing interval and first-dose vaccine efficacy had a relatively lower impact on disease prevention in the population. Compared to the long (11 years) dosing interval, the short (5 months) and medium (5 years) interval schedules reduced varicella cases by a further 5-13 % and 2-5 %, respectively. Similarly, a 10 % increase in first-dose efficacy (from 65 to 75 % efficacy) prevented 2-5 % more varicella cases, suggesting it is the least influential factor when considering routine varicella vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination strategies can be implemented differently in each country depending on their needs, infrastructure and healthcare budget. However, ensuring high coverage remains the critical success factor for significant prevention of varicella when introducing varicella vaccination in the national immunisation programme.","['Holl K', 'Sauboin C', 'Amodio E', 'Bonanni P', 'Gabutti G']",2016,16,1,BMC Public Health,"Holl K, et al.

27765026,"Increasing incidence associated with herpes zoster infection in British Columbia, Canada.","BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown an increasing incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) infection, which may be related to the introduction of varicella vaccination programs in children. We examined the epidemiology and treatment costs of HZ and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) over time in British Columbia, Canada.
METHODS: The cohort consisted of all cases with HZ infection from January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2012. Incident zoster was defined as a case (ICD-9 053 or ICD-10 B02) without a previous episode of HZ or PHN in the previous 12 months. We determined the incidence for HZ and PHN and the age-sex standardized rate for the overall population. We determined the association between the varicella vaccination program and increased HZ rates by evaluating the rate ratios in the publicly-funded varicella vaccine period compared to the non-publicly funded period in a regression model. We evaluated the hospitalization rates, treatment by GPs and their associated yearly costs for HZ and PHN.
RESULTS: HZ incidence increased for the entire study period from 3.2 per 1000 population in 1997 to 4.5 in 2012. HZ rates were higher for females than males and all age groups had an increased incidence rate, except the 0-9 year olds, where the rate decreased. Crude and age-sex standardized incidence rates of PHN demonstrated very similar patterns to HZ incidence. Based on the regression model, rates of HZ were higher in the older individuals. No significant increase with HZ incidence was seen during the publically funded varicella vaccination program compared to the non-publicly funded period. From 1997 to 2012, the annual HZ-related costs associated with hospitalizations and GP visits were over $CDN4.9 million and $CDN537,286, respectively; treatment costs for hospitalizations have increased significantly over time. Majority of PHN-related cases are managed by GPs, with a steady increase over time in number of cases and associated annual costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of zoster and PHN is increasing with time, particularly in the elderly population and the risk is greater in the over 65 year olds. Treatment costs for both HZ and PHN represent a significant burden on the Canadian healthcare system.","['Marra F', 'Chong M', 'Najafzadeh M']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Marra F, et al.

27753768,Varicella Vaccination of Children With Leukemia Without Interruption of Maintenance Therapy: A Danish Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can be fatal or cause severe complications in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This analysis set out to investigate the morbidity and mortality of VZV vaccination without interruption of maintenance therapy in children with ALL.
METHODS: Files of 73 seronegative children with ALL were examined for data regarding VZV vaccination and infection, and long-term seroconversion was measured. Criteria before VZV vaccination were (1) seronegative, (2) in complete remission, (3) age ≥ 1.0 year, (4) lymphocyte count ≥ 0.6 × 10/L at time of vaccination and (5) receiving maintenance therapy.
RESULTS: Forty-five children were vaccinated. No child died or experienced serious adverse events due to VZV vaccination. Nine children developed late chickenpox despite vaccination. Long-term protection was found in 86% of children not receiving acyclovir and 78% of the entire population. Long-term seroconversion was found in 52% of the children. There were no severe cases of varicella infection. Acyclovir prophylaxis postvaccination was associated with an increased risk of late chickenpox [hazard ratio = 5.40 (1.43, 20.41), P = 0.01]. In contrast, a vaccine-induced rash reduced the risk of late chickenpox [hazard ratio = 0.08 (0.01, 0.66), P = 0.02]. No child had interruption of maintenance therapy at the time of vaccination, but 33% experienced discontinuation of therapy due to vaccine-induced rash. Dexamethasone was associated with an increased risk of vaccine-induced rash [hazard ratio = 2.9 (1.21, 6.90), P = 0.02].
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that VZV vaccination is feasible and justified in seronegative children with ALL, in countries where VZV vaccination is not part of the national vaccination program.","['Smedegaard LM', 'Poulsen A', 'Kristensen IA', 'Rosthøj S', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Nygaard U']",2016,35,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Smedegaard LM, et al.

We report a rare association of varicella pneumonia presenting in acute respiratory distress with mild chest pain, however with electrocardiographic and biochemical markers suggestive of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography was done to exclude infarction, serum antibody titers confirmed varicella, acyclovir was started, and ARDS was successfully treated with steroid pulse therapy and mechanical ventilator support. Early administration of antivirals and aggressive management of ARDS were thought to be necessary to overcome the potential life-threatening complications of varicella infection in adults.

27749656,Children Hospitalized With Varicella in Denmark: Sensitivity of the National Patient Register.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella, common in childhood and most often self-limiting, may cause complications including bacterial superinfection, pneumonia and encephalitis. Universal childhood varicella vaccination has been introduced in several countries, but is controversial in Europe. In Denmark, varicella is not part of the national immunization program and there is no national surveillance of varicella. The primary aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of children hospitalized with varicella in Denmark. The secondary aim was to validate the sensitivity and completeness of the Danish National Patient Register.
METHODS: Active surveillance of children hospitalized with varicella was carried out at 4 pediatric departments. In the Danish National Patient Register, we identified all children discharged with an International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision code of varicella from the 4 departments. We used a capture-recapture analysis to estimate the ""true"" number of hospitalized children with varicella.
RESULTS: By active surveillance, we identified 86 children eligible for clinical description. In 87% of cases, the children were 0-4 years of age. Complications were identified in 69% of patients, including 1 child with postvaricella cerebral angiopathy. In the National Patient register (NPR), we identified 125 children with a discharge diagnosis of varicella. By capture-recapture analysis, the sensitivity of the NPR was estimated to be 74%.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella can cause serious complications including cerebral angiopathy in children in Denmark. The NPR will be a useful tool for estimating hospitalization incidence, but will underestimate the true number of hospitalizations.","['Glode Helmuth I', 'Broccia MD', 'Glenthøj JP', 'Harder K', 'Jensen L', 'von Linstow ML', 'Poulsen A', 'Mølbak K']",2017,36,1,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Glode Helmuth I, et al.

27749651,"Decline of Neurologic Varicella Complications in Children During the First Seven Years After Introduction of Universal Varicella Vaccination in Germany, 2005-2011.","BACKGROUND: Universal varicella vaccination for 1-year-old children was introduced in Germany in 2004. We investigated changes in the incidence and type of varicella-associated neurologic complications in children during the first 7 years after universal vaccination recommendation.
METHODS: A surveillance study was conducted based on patients <17 years of age with an International Classification of Diseases (10th Revision) discharge diagnosis of varicella, annually reported by 22-29 pediatric hospitals in Bavaria, Germany, 2005 to 2011. Annual incidences were estimated and linear trend across years was assessed by Poisson regression models.
RESULTS: Of a total of 1263 varicella-associated pediatric hospitalizations, 228 children (18.1%) had neurologic complications (median age 4 years, interquartile range 2-7; 56% male). The most frequent neurologic complications were febrile convulsion (32.0% of 228 children, median age 3.0 years), varicella encephalitis or meningitis (28.9%; median age 4.5 years), syncope (13.2%; median age 7.0 years) and cerebral convulsion (11.0%; median age 4.0 years). Other complications included ataxia (3.1%), facial nerve palsy (2.6%) and cerebral vasculitis/infarction (1.8%). Neurologic complications showed a continuous decrease between 2005 and 2011, from an incidence of 2.8 (95% confidence interval: 2.1-3.6) per 100,000 children <17 years of age to 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.7-2.1; P < 0.001). In particular, a marked decline was observed among children up to 7 years of age, mainly because of a decrease in the number of febrile convulsions and encephalitis or meningitis.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of varicella-associated neurologic complications in children decreased approximately by 60% during the first 7 years following the recommendation for universal vaccination.","['Streng A', 'Grote V', 'Rack-Hoch A', 'Liese JG']",2017,36,1,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Streng A, et al.

27717328,Nationwide distribution of varicella-zoster virus clades in China.,"BACKGROUND: In 2010, a universal nomenclature for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) clades was established, which is very useful in the monitoring of viral evolution, recombination, spread and genetic diversity. Currently, information about VZV clades has been disclosed worldwide, however, there are limited data regarding the characterization of circulating VZV clades in China, even where varicella remains widely epidemic.
METHODS: From 2008 to 2012, clinical samples with varicella or zoster were collected in General Hospital in eight provinces and analyzed by PCR, restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing. The viral clades were determined by analysis of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 447-bp fragment of open reading frame (ORF) 22, and the restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of ORF 38 (PstI), ORF 54 (BglI) and ORF 62 (SmaI) were evaluated to understand genetic diversity of VZV and determinate varicella vaccine adverse event (VVAE).
RESULTS: Seventy-seven varicella and 11 zoster samples were identified as being positive for VZV. The five SNPs profile showed that the majority of VZV strains belonged to clade 2, but clade 5 and clade 4 strains were also found in Guangdong. The RFLPs analysis of the DNA fragments of ORF 38, 54 and 62 showed that 85 of these samples were characterized as PstI + BglI + SamI-, and the remaining three VZV strains from varicella patients were characterized as PstI-BglI + SamI+ which is the genetic profile of VVAEs.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that the predominant clade 2 VZVs had been continually circulating since at least the 1950s in China. Nearly all VZV strains except VVAEs possessed the genetic profile of PstI + BglI + Sam-. However, the other clades were also found to be co-circulating with clade 2, especially in the border regions. These results highlighted the need for the constant and broad use of virologic surveillance to provide an important genetic baseline for varicella control and vaccination programs in China.","['Xu S', 'Chen M', 'Zheng H', 'Wang H', 'Chen M', 'Zhou J', 'Shuang W', 'Yu P', 'Ma C', 'He J', 'Feng D', 'Zhen Z', 'Yan Z', 'Naiying M', 'Cui A', 'Wu Q', 'Qi M', 'Li C', 'Xu X', 'Xu W']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Xu S, et al.

The data were also examined for potential vaccination coverage differences by race/ethnicity, poverty status, and urbanicity. Although disparities were noted for each of these factors, the most striking differences were seen for poverty status. Children living below the federal poverty level* had lower coverage with most of the vaccinations assessed compared with children living at or above the poverty level; the largest disparities were for rotavirus vaccine (66.8% versus 76.8%), ≥4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (78.9% versus 87.2%), the full series of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) (78.1% versus 85.5%), and ≥4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) (80.2% versus 87.1%). Although coverage was high in some groups, opportunities exist to continue to address disparities. Implementation of evidence-based interventions, including strategies to enhance access to vaccination services and systems strategies that can reduce missed opportunities, has the potential to increase vaccination coverage for children living below the poverty level and in rural areas (3).","['Hill HA', 'Elam-Evans LD', 'Yankey D', 'Singleton JA', 'Dietz V']",2016,65,39,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Hill HA, et al.

27703368,"Postherpetic neuralgia: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and pain management pharmacology.","Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is a distinctive clinical condition caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster (chickenpox) virus following an initial infection. Approximately 1 million cases of herpes zoster occur annually in the US, and one in every three people develops herpes zoster during their lifetime. Postherpetic neuralgia is a neuropathic pain syndrome characterized by pain that persists for months to years after resolution of the herpes zoster rash. It stems from damage to peripheral and central neurons that may be a byproduct of the immune/inflammatory response accompanying varicella zoster virus reactivation. Patients with postherpetic neuralgia report decreased quality of life and interference with activities of daily living. Approaches to management of postherpetic neuralgia include preventing herpes zoster through vaccination and/or antiviral treatment, and administering specific medications to treat pain. Current guidelines recommend treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in a hierarchical manner, with calcium channel α2-δ ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or desipramine), or topical lidocaine patches as first-line drugs. The safety and tolerability of pharmacologic therapies for pain are important issues to consider as postherpetic neuralgia affects primarily an older population. Patients should be educated on appropriate dosing, titration if applicable, the importance of adherence to treatment for optimal effectiveness, and possible side effects. Health-care professionals play a key role in helping to ameliorate the pain caused by postherpetic neuralgia through early recognition and diligent assessment of the problem; recommending evidence-based treatments; and monitoring treatment adherence, adverse events, responses, and expectations. Nurse practitioners are especially crucial in establishing communication with patients and encouraging the initiation of appropriate pain-relieving treatments.","['Mallick-Searle T', 'Snodgrass B', 'Brant JM']",2016,9,,J Multidiscip Healthc,"Mallick-Searle T, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprotection against hepatitis B, measles, rubella, and varicella among HCWs in a community hospital in Qatar.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey conducted in a 75-bed community hospital in Dukhan, Qatar. From August 2012 to December 2015, 705 HCWs were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies for measles, rubella, and varicella, and also for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). They were also asked about previous history of hepatitis B vaccination.
RESULTS: 595 (84.4%) HCWs received a full hepatitis B vaccination schedule; 110 (15.6%) received a single dose.

27622686,"Update on Incidence of Herpes Zoster Among Children and Adolescents After Implementation of Varicella Vaccination, Antelope Valley, CA, 2000 to 2010.","BACKGROUND: Changes in herpes zoster (HZ) epidemiology are expected with childhood varicella vaccination. We reported previously that during 2000 to 2006 HZ incidence decreased 55% in children <10 years of age, while among 10- to 19-year olds it increased by 63%. We update the analysis with 4 additional years of data.
METHODS: Population-based active surveillance was conducted for HZ in Antelope Valley, California. Structured telephone interviews and medical chart reviews collected data on demographics, varicella vaccinations, disease histories and clinical information. We calculated HZ incidence for 2007 to 2010 and assessed trends since 2000.
RESULTS: Among children <10 years of age, HZ incidence continued the decreasing trend previously reported. During 2007 to 2010, the average incidence was 12.8 cases/100,000 children compared with 41.6 cases/100,000 children during 2000 to 2006, a 69% decline (P < 0.0001). For the 10- to 19-year olds, during 2007 to 2010 HZ incidence did not continue the increasing trend reported from 2000 to 2006; lower rates than in 2006 were observed in 3 of the 4 additional years evaluated. During 2007 to 2010 the average incidence was 78.2 cases/100,000 children compared with 68.0 cases/100,000 children during 2000 to 2006, a 13% increase (P = 0.123), with substantial fluctuation in annual rates throughout the 11 years of surveillance.
CONCLUSIONS: During the mature varicella vaccination program, declines in HZ incidence among children <10 years of age continued through 2010. Among the 10- to 19-year olds, the increase reported through 2006 did not continue further and lower rates than in 2006 were observed through 2010.

Four deceased chickens (one Nagoya breed and three white silkie chickens) were examined for diagnosis. At necropsy, white curd-like plaques were observed in the crop. Fungal elements that stained positive for Candida albicans with immunohistochemistry were distributed throughout the tongue, choanal mucosa, esophagus, and crop. Typical fowlpox lesions, composed of proliferating epithelial cells with ballooning degeneration and viral intracytoplasmic inclusions, were observed in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, and skin around the cloaca. Interestingly, hyperplastic interfollicular epithelium with rare virus inclusions was observed in the bursa of Fabricius (BF). Some bursal follicles were replaced by proliferating epithelial cells. These proliferating cells immunohistochemically stained positive for cytokeratin. PCR and subsequent genetic sequencing detected the C. albicans gene in the crop, and fowlpox virus genes in the BF.

27606936,"Notes from the Field: Varicella Outbreak Associated with Riding on a School Bus - Muskegon County, Michigan, 2015.","On December 3, 2015, Public Health-Muskegon County (PHMC) in Michigan was notified by a local kindergarten-grade 2 school that a student aged 8 years (the index patient) had been sent home because of a rash suspected to be varicella (chickenpox); the rash had not been observed the previous day. Investigation by PHMC revealed that the student was one of five siblings in household A, none of whom had a history of having received any immunizations. During the preceding month the index patient's two older siblings (aged 12 years and 25 years) and two younger siblings (twins, aged 4 years) had been excluded from other schools in this rural district because of rashes that also were suspected to be varicella. Investigators also learned that a parent in household A had received a physician diagnosis of herpes zoster (shingles) nearly 7 weeks earlier, on October 20, after having been evaluated for a painful, unilateral trunk rash that had begun 3 days earlier, and for which acyclovir was prescribed. PHMC could not confirm whether any advice regarding prevention of possible transmission of varicella zoster virus to susceptible contacts was provided. The other children in household A had rash onsets on November 3, November 18 (two children), and November 22. The index patient rode a school bus and was the first student on and the last off each day; none of the index patient's four siblings attended the same school or rode on the same school bus as the index patient. Public health investigators subsequently linked three more cases in children to sharing the same school bus as the index patient.","['Hoch DE', 'Linda Scott', 'Jean Chang']",2016,65,35,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Hoch DE, et al.

27591104,Safety profile of the varicella vaccine (Oka vaccine strain) based on reported cases from 2005 to 2015 in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: As of 2014, routine vaccination strategies in Japan have included the varicella vaccine. Given the widespread use of the vaccine, it is important to investigate the safety profile of the vaccine strain, Oka/Biken varicella, in Japanese patients.
METHODS: Reports of adverse events associated with varicella vaccination between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Virological analysis was performed on clinical specimens collected from some of the reported cases to determine whether the etiological agent was the wild-type or Oka vaccine-strains.
RESULTS: There were 351 reports (3.71/100,000 doses) of adverse events during the observation period. Among the 351 reports, there were 88 reports (0.93/100,000 doses) of varicella-like and 66 reports (0.70/100,000 doses) of zoster-like skin rashes. The wild-type strain induced varicella-like skin rashes earlier than the Oka vaccine strain. The Oka vaccine strain induced zoster-like skin rashes in younger patients compared to the wild-type strain. The onset of zoster-like skin rashes after vaccination was earlier in patients vaccinated with the Oka vaccine-type strain.
CONCLUSION: The Oka/Biken vaccine is generally safe and well tolerated in Japan. Clinical aspects of adverse reactions caused by the Oka vaccine strain were consistent with previous reports from the United States and Europe.","['Yoshikawa T', 'Ando Y', 'Nakagawa T', 'Gomi Y']",2016,34,41,Vaccine,"Yoshikawa T, et al.

27585798,Acute Demyelinating Events Following Vaccines: A Case-Centered Analysis.,"BACKGROUND:  Case reports have suggested that vaccines may trigger transverse myelitis (TM) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), but the evidence for a causal association is inconclusive. We analyzed the association of immunization and subsequent development of TM or ADEM.
METHODS:  We identified all cases of TM and ADEM in the Vaccine Safety Datalink population. Using a case-centered method, we compared vaccination of each case to vaccination of all matched persons in the study population, who received the same type of vaccine, with respect to whether or not their vaccination occurred during a predetermined exposure interval. We calculated a risk difference (excess risk) of TM and ADEM for each vaccine.
RESULTS:  Following nearly 64 million vaccine doses, only 7 cases of TM and 8 cases of ADEM were vaccinated during the primary exposure window 5-28 days prior to onset. For TM, there was no statistically significant increased risk of immunization. For ADEM, there was no statistically significant increased risk following any vaccine except for Tdap (adolescent and adult tetanus, reduced diphtheria, acellular pertussis) vaccine. Based on 2 exposed cases, the odds ratio for Tdap exposure 5-28 days prior to ADEM onset was 15.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-471.6; P = .04), and the estimated excess risk was 0.385 (95% CI, -.04 to 1.16) cases per million doses.
CONCLUSIONS:  We found no association between TM and prior immunization. There was a possible association of ADEM with Tdap vaccine, but the excess risk is not likely to be more than 1.16 cases of ADEM per million vaccines administered.","['Baxter R', 'Lewis E', 'Goddard K', 'Fireman B', 'Bakshi N', 'DeStefano F', 'Gee J', 'Tseng HF', 'Naleway AL', 'Klein NP']",2016,63,11,Clin Infect Dis,"Baxter R, et al.

27585235,Varicella seroprevalence in individuals with a negative or unknown varicella history - results from a large travel clinic in Switzerland between 2008 and 2015.,"QUESTION UNDER STUDY: In Switzerland, vaccination against varicella is not recommended in the basic immunisation schedule. However, for individuals aged 11-40 years who do not have a reliable varicella history the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health recommends either (i) a vaccination or (ii) a serology test and vaccination of those with a negative result. In the Travel Clinic of the University of Zurich, the second strategy is followed. In this study we retrospectively assessed the overall percentage of individuals with varicella-specific antibodies despite a negative history and we examined the influence of age, number of siblings, order of siblings, age difference to siblings and nationality on varicella seropositivity.
METHODS: Between December 2008 and August 2015, the sera of 1757 individuals with a negative varicella history were tested for varicella antibodies.
RESULTS: A total of 1593 individuals (91%) had a positive result. We found an increasing trend for varicella seropositivity with increasing age. Those aged less than 40 years were significantly more often seronegative (9.5%) than those aged 40 years and above (6.0%, p = 0.049). Seropositivity was associated with nationality. The percentage of seropositives increased with the number of siblings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that, despite the significant varicella seropositivity differences between those aged below and above, the age of 40 may not be an ideal threshold for performing a varicella serology in individuals with a negative or unknown varicella history. In the age groups above 40, testing for varicella antibodies may be especially reasonable in individuals with no or a small number of siblings and in those of specific nationalities.","['Freuler M', 'De Crom S', 'Hatz C', 'Bühler S']",2016,146,,Swiss Med Wkly,"Freuler M, et al.

27584717,"Epidemiology of Varicella During the 2-Dose Varicella Vaccination Program - United States, 2005-2014.","Before availability of varicella vaccine in the United States, an estimated 4 million varicella cases, 11,000-13,500 varicella-related hospitalizations, and 100-150 varicella-related deaths occurred annually. The varicella vaccination program was implemented in the United States in 1996 as a 1-dose routine childhood program. Based on data from two varicella active surveillance sites, the varicella vaccination program led to 90% decline in incidence over the next decade (1). However, because of continued varicella outbreaks, a routine 2-dose schedule (at ages 12-15 months and 4-6 years) was recommended and has been in place since 2006 (2). The declines in incidence (1,3-6) made it feasible for states to implement varicella case-based surveillance and to report varicella data to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). State data have become the primary source for monitoring trends in varicella incidence nationally (7). Using NNDSS data, CDC previously reported nationwide declines in varicella incidence of 72% from the end of the 1-dose to the early years of the 2-dose varicella vaccination program (2006-2010) (7). This report updates varicella incidence trends to include the most recent years in the 2-dose varicella vaccination program. Between the period 2005-2006 (before the 2-dose recommendation) and 2013-2014, overall varicella incidence declined 84.6%, with the largest declines reported in children aged 5-9 years (89.3%) and 10-14 years (84.8%). The availability of varicella-specific data varied over time. During the last 2 years examined (2013 and 2014), completeness of reporting of two critical variables monitored by CDC, vaccination status (receipt of at least 1 dose of varicella vaccine) of cases and severity of disease based on number of lesions, were 54.2% and 39.1%, respectively. State and local health departments, in collaboration with CDC, should continue working to improve reporting of cases and completeness of critical varicella-specific variables to better monitor impact of the varicella vaccination program.","['Lopez AS', 'Zhang J', 'Marin M']",2016,65,34,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Lopez AS, et al.

27583870,"Sudden, unexpected death of a 15-year-old boy due to pancarditis: A case report and possible etiopathogenesis.","BACKGROUND: Generally, rheumatic heart disease is, today, sporadic in developed countries, even though it continues to be a major health hazard in the developing ones. It is also a very rare cause of sudden unexpected death. We report a case of a 15-year-old boy who suddenly died at home. Since 3 days he had presented fever and chest pain. The family physician had diagnosed bronchitis and treated the boy with amoxicillin.
METHODS: Seven hours after death, a forensic autopsy were performed . Before the autopsy, anamnesis and some circumstantial data were collected from the boy's parents. During the autopsy, samples for histological, toxicological and molecular examinations were collected. The samples for the histology (brain, hypophysis, heart and pericardium, lungs, spleen, liver, kidney, adrenal glands) were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Each section was stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin. Immunostaining was also performed, with anti-CD 68, anti-CD3, anti-CD 20, anti-myeloperoxidase. Microbiological cultures were performed on cardiac blood, myocardium, pericardial effusion and cerebrospinal fluid samples collected during autopsy. Blood specimens were also processed through PCR, in order to reveal the presence of Enteroviruses, Chickenpox virus, Epstein Barr virus. Also chemical-toxicological examinations for the detection of the main medications and drugs were performed on blood samples.
RESULTS: The anamnesis, collected before the autopsy, revealed an acute pharyngitis few weeks before. The autopsy, and the following histological and immunochemical examinations suggested an immunological etiology. The immunohistochemistry, showing a strong positivity of antiCD68 antibodies, integrated with clinical-anamnestic information, leads to hypothesize a rheumatic carditis.
CONCLUSION: In light of this case, at least 3 main messages of great importance for the clinician can be deduced. First, an accurate anamnesis collected by the family physician could have led to the correct interpretation of the objective signs and the administration of an appropriate therapy. Second, a pharyngeal swab should be performed for cases involving sore throat in young children and adolescents, especially in cases involving repeated pharyngitis. Finally, apparently unremarkable findings revealed from objective examinations can be signs of a serious disease. Moreover, in some cases, these diseases can be lethal if they are not properly treated.","['Osculati A', 'Visonà SD', 'Ventura F', 'Castelli F', 'Andrello L']",2016,95,35,Medicine (Baltimore),"Osculati A, et al.

A cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire to determine HCWs' histories of chickenpox or 2-dose varicella vaccination was conducted. From a total of 699 HCWs, 653 HCWs (93%), including 145 physicians (22%), 297 nurses (46%), and 211 administrative staff (32%), responded to questionnaires. There were 475 HCWs (73%) who had a history of chickenpox, 58 (9%) who had completed the 2-dose varicella vaccine schedule, and 120 (18%) whose varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunity status was uncertain. In total, 107 HCWs (89%) were tested for VZV IgG, 90 of whom had immunity, and 17 were determined to be non-immune. After combining history and VZV IgG test results, the prevalence of non-immune HCWs was 2.6% (95%CI 1.4-3.8), with those ≤40 years of age at higher risk of non-immunity. Implementing a strategy that involves testing of only those with an unknown VZV status and vaccination for only those determined to be non-immune costs 1,801 United States dollar (USD), less than the total cost (4,601 USD) for vaccinating all HCWs with uncertain status.","['Anugulruengkitt S', 'Puthanakit T', 'Siengboon S', 'Paitoonpong L', 'Kowitdamrong E', 'Pancharoen C', 'Pichitchok Y']",2017,70,2,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Anugulruengkitt S, et al.

27563537,Microbiology laboratory and the management of mother-child varicella-zoster virus infection.,"Varicella-zoster virus, which is responsible for varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles), is ubiquitous and causes an acute infection among children, especially those aged less than six years. As 90% of adults have had varicella in childhood, it is unusual to encounter an infected pregnant woman but, if the disease does appear, it can lead to complications for both the mother and fetus or newborn. The major maternal complications include pneumonia, which can lead to death if not treated. If the virus passes to the fetus, congenital varicella syndrome, neonatal varicella (particularly serious if maternal rash appears in the days immediately before or after childbirth) or herpes zoster in the early years of life may occur depending on the time of infection. A Microbiology laboratory can help in the diagnosis and management of mother-child infection at four main times: (1) when a pregnant woman has been exposed to varicella or herpes zoster, a prompt search for specific antibodies can determine whether she is susceptible to, or protected against infection; (2) when a pregnant woman develops clinical symptoms consistent with varicella, the diagnosis is usually clinical, but a laboratory can be crucial if the symptoms are doubtful or otherwise unclear (atypical patterns in immunocompromised subjects, patients with post-vaccination varicella, or subjects who have received immunoglobulins), or if there is a need for a differential diagnosis between varicella and other types of dermatoses with vesicle formation; (3) when a prenatal diagnosis of uterine infection is required in order to detect cases of congenital varicella syndrome after the onset of varicella in the mother; and (4) when the baby is born and it is necessary to confirm a diagnosis of varicella (and its complications), make a differential diagnosis between varicella and other diseases with similar symptoms, or confirm a causal relationship between maternal varicella and malformations in a newborn.","['De Paschale M', 'Clerici P']",2016,5,3,World J Virol,De Paschale M and Clerici P.

27556624,Skin-Sparing Débridement for Necrotizing Fasciitis in Children.,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious soft-tissue infection associated with sepsis and tissue destruction. Surgical management usually requires extensive débridement of necrotic fascia and overlying skin, with significant aesthetic and functional consequences. The authors review the outcome of all recent cases of necrotizing fasciitis treated with skin-sparing débridement at their institution.
METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of all of their cases of necrotizing fasciitis treated with skin-sparing débridement. Medical records were evaluated with a standard form gathering relevant demographic and clinical data. All cases were confirmed as necrotizing fasciitis histologically.
RESULTS: Ten patients were admitted with a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. The median age of the patients was 4.9 years (range, 1.7 to 15.1 years). The majority of initial lesions were caused by chickenpox, mostly on the trunk. Interval from admission to surgery was 6 hours (range, 1 to 27.5 hours), with a median hospital stay of 11 days (range, 5 to 43 days). Median fasciectomy was 2.5 percent (range, 1 to 15 percent) of total body surface area, with a median skin excision of 0.25 percent of total body surface area (range, 0.1 to 3 percent). All patients received intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plus clindamycin. Delayed direct closure was possible for all patients. Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 3 to 79 months). There was no death in this series.
CONCLUSION: This surgical management restricts skin excision to the area of definite skin necrosis, limiting skin excision to one-tenth of excised fascia, with long-term favorable cosmetic and functional results.

27551429,Efficacy of varicella (VZV) vaccination: an update for the clinician.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection causes two distinct clinical conditions. Primary varicella infection results in chickenpox, a contagious rash illness typically seen among children. VZV can reactivate years after the initial infection to cause herpes zoster (HZ) and lead to post-herpetic neuralgia, a common complication resulting in persistent pain that may last for years after the zoster rash resolves. A person's risk of having longer lasting and more severe pain associated with HZ increases with age. Since the introduction of VZV vaccines, the rates of infection, hospitalizations, and mortality have declined. In this review, we discuss in detail current VZV vaccines available for the prevention of VZV and HZ infections. Varilrix (GSK Biologicals, UK), Varivax (Merck, USA) and the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine contain the live attenuated Oka strain of VZV for routine varicella vaccination. While Zostavax is the only HZ vaccine currently approved for use in the United States and the European Union [EMEA, 2011], a subunit vaccine candidate called HZ/su has recently shown improved efficacy for zoster prevention in two clinical trial phase III studies. VariZIG, a post-exposure prophylactic, uses zoster immune globulin to prevent VZV infection in those who have recently been in contact with VZV but lack evidence of varicella immunity and are contraindicated to receive the varicella vaccine. Further, we discuss the skin tropic and neurotropic factor VZV ORF7 gene and its involvement in varicella infection, reactivation and latency in ganglia. Ultimately, these studies can contribute to the development of a neuroattenuated vaccine candidate against varicella or a vector for delivery of other virus antigens.","['Wang L', 'Zhu L', 'Zhu H']",2016,4,01월 02일,Ther Adv Vaccines,"Wang L, et al.

METHODS: Vesicle fluid and throat swab samples were collected from 13 individuals with suspected VZV in Jilin province from January to December 2014. Viral DNA was extracted, the fragments of 15 open reading fragments (ORFs) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and viral genotypes were determined by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to distinguish between wild-type strains and v-Oka vaccine strains. The results were analyzed with MEGA5 software, using the VZV reference strain sequences from GenBank.
RESULTS: The 13 suspected samples included 5 males and 8 females, aged 11-27 years (mean: (16.69±5.48) years). Sampling was performed on days 0 to 3 of suspected infection. VZV strains were detected in 8 samples, all belonging to Clade 2. There was a synonymous mutation (T>C) in SNP18082 compared with the v-Oka vaccine strain. Analysis of PCR-RFLPs showed that all 8 positive samples were wild-type strains (PstⅠ(+)BglⅠ(+)SmaⅠ(-)).

There was no evidence of retinitis. The patient systemically improved after treatment with acyclovir and steroids; however, his vision remained poor.
CONCLUSION: Chickenpox can be associated with systemic vasculopathy and may rarely result in multiple systemic and ocular infarcts, including severe retinal vascular occlusions.","['Murdock J', 'Carvounis PE']",2017,11,4,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Murdock J and Carvounis PE.

27529963,[Results of Booster Vaccination in Children with Primary Vaccine Failure after Initial Varicella Vaccination].,"In October 2014, the varicella vaccination policy in Japan was changed from a single voluntary inoculation to two routine inoculations. This paper reports the results of booster vaccination in children who did not show seroconversion after initial vaccination (i.e., primary vaccine failure : PVF) over a 7-year period prior to the introduction of routine varicella vaccination. Between November 2007 and May 2014, 273 healthy children aged between 1.1 and 14.5 years (median : 1.7 years) underwent varicella vaccination. Before and 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination, the antibody titers were measured using an immune adherence hemagglutination (IAHA) assay and a glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). In addition, side reactions were examined during the four-week period after vaccination. Children who did not show IAHA seroconversion (PVF) were recommended to receive a booster vaccination, and the measurement of antibody titers and an assessment of side reactions were performed after the booster dose. In May 2015, a questionnaire was mailed to each of the 273 participants to investigate whether they had developed varicella and/or herpes zoster after vaccination. After initial vaccination, the IAHA seroconversion rate was 75% and the mean antibody titer (Log2) with seroconversion was 4.7, while the gpELISA seroconversion rate was 84% and the mean antibody titer (Log10) with seroconversion was 2.4. Among children with PVF, 54 received booster vaccination within 81 to 714 days (median : 139 days) after the initial vaccination. After booster vaccination, the IAHA seroconversion rate was 98% and the mean antibody titer (Log2) with seroconversion was 5.8. Both the seroconversion rate and the antibody titer were higher compared with the values after the initial vaccination (p < 0.01). After booster vaccination, the gpELISA seropositive rate was 100% and the mean positive antibody titer (Log 10) was 3.6 ; similar results were obtained for the IAHA assay, with a significantly higher, antibody response than that after the initial vaccination (p < 0.01). Side reactions were generally minor, including fever (≥ 37.5 degrees C), rash at the injection site, and rash at other sites. There were no significant differences in the incidences of side reactions between the initial and booster vaccinations. A total of 185 participants responded to the questionnaire (response rate : 68%), and the period between receiving the initial vaccination and their response to the questionnaire ranged from 1.0 to 7.5 years (median : 4.0 years). The prevalence of breakthrough varicella after the initial vaccination was 17% among seroconverters who did not receive booster vaccination and 14% among non-seroconverters who received booster vaccination, showing no significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, there are no safety issues regarding the administration of a booster vaccination to children with PVF after an initial varicella vaccination, and,a good antibody response can be expected.","['Ozakiv T', 'Nishimura N', 'Gotoh K', 'Funahashi K', 'Yoshii H', 'Okuno Y']",2016,90,3,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Ozakiv T, et al.

27515422,Human herpes viruses in burn patients: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: The contribution of human herpes viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) to morbidity and mortality after burns remains controversial. This systematic review was undertaken to assess evidence of herpes virus-related morbidity and mortality in burns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science were searched to identify studies of HSV, CMV, or VZV infections in burn patients. Exclusion criteria included: A level of evidence (LoE) of IV or V; nonhuman in vivo studies; and non-English articles. There was no limitation by publication date.
RESULTS: Fifty articles were subjected to full-text analysis. Of these, 18 had LoE between I-III and were included in the final review (2 LoE I, 16 LoE II-III). Eight had a prospective study design, 9 had a retrospective study design, and 1 included both.
CONCLUSIONS: No direct evidence linked CMV and HSV infection with increased morbidity and mortality in burns. Following burn, CMV reactivation was more common than a primary CMV infection. Active HSV infection impaired wound healing but was not directly correlated to mortality. Infections with VZV are rare after burns but when they occur, VZV infections were associated with severe complications including mortality. The therapeutic effect of antiviral agents administered after burns warrants investigation via prospective randomized controlled trials.","['Wurzer P', 'Guillory A', 'Parvizi D', 'Clayton RP', 'Branski LK', 'Kamolz LP', 'Finnerty CC', 'Herndon DN', 'Lee JO']",2017,43,1,Burns,"Wurzer P, et al.

27504325,"A Prospective Study of the Clinical Profile, Outcome and Evaluation of D-dimer in Cerebral Venous Thrombosis.","INTRODUCTION: Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) is a well known disease with diverse clinical presentation and causes. With advances in neuroimaging and changing lifestyles, the clinical profile and causes of CVT are changing. D-dimer has been studied in early diagnosis of CVT with variable results. This prospective study was carried out to assess the clinical profile of CVT and role of D-dimer in diagnosis of CVT.
AIM: To study various aspects of CVT and role of D-dimer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study period was September 2012 to July 2014 and included 80 imaging proven patients of CVT. We also included 39 controls for assessing D-dimer. Data was collected according to a preformed format. D-dimer was assessed by a rapid semi-quantitative latex agglutination assay. Discharged patients were followed up to six months.
RESULTS: Of the total 44 were women and 36 were men (F: M=1.2:1). The mean age of the patients was 29.5±9.68 years. Most common clinical features were headache 77 (96.25%), papilloedema (67.5%) and seizures 51 (63.75%). Pregnancy was the most common cause of CVT. Superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most common sinuses to be affected. The sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer for diagnosing CVT was 84.62% and 80% respectively. The risk factors for poor prognosis were altered sensorium, presence of sepsis, increased sinus involvement and deep sinus thrombosis.
CONCLUSION: CVT affects both sexes equally. Puerperium still contributes to majority of the cases. Iron deficiency anaemia needs to be evaluated as a contributing factor for incidence of CVT. D-dimer is not useful in puerperal female with CVT. Positive D-dimer will strengthen the suspicion of CVT in patients with acute headache followed by a neurological deficit.","['Thammishetti V', 'Dharanipragada S', 'Basu D', 'Ananthakrishnan R', 'Surendiran D']",2016,10,6,J Clin Diagn Res,"Thammishetti V, et al.

27504182,The association between varicella (chickenpox) and group A streptococcus infections in historical perspective.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the research is to investigate the historical relationship between varicella and Streptococcus pyogenes infections. In the past few decades, varicella has been identified as a risk factor for invasive group A streptococcus infections. The question is whether this relationship also existed between varicella and scarlet fever in the historical era.
METHODS: The analysis begins with a search of historical medical reports on the relationship between varicella and scarlet fever epidemics in the late 19th and early 20th century, as well as in more recent empirical studies. Correlations and cross-correlations between varicella and scarlet fever are analyzed using weekly public health case reports from 1924 to 1932 for Boston, Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia. Regression models are used to estimate the relationship between varicella and scarlet fever after controlling for seasonal forcing.
RESULTS: Historical records give limited support for a causal relationship between varicella and scarlet fever but indicate that these diseases often occurred close in time to each other. Likewise, statistical analysis shows that varicella and scarlet fever epidemics are closely aligned with each other, and varicella has a strong relationship with scarlet fever. The relationship is stronger than reported in any previous research on the two diseases.
CONCLUSION: The close correspondence of the two diseases likely depends on multiple factors, including seasonal forcing, a causal relationship, and co-infections. The results raise questions about whether this close relationship might have had a synergistic effect or a role in the evolution of S. pyogenes from the virulent, high incidence epidemics of the 19th century to the relatively benign scarlet fever of the 1950s.",['Coleman S'],2016,4,,SAGE Open Med,Coleman S.

27484734,Seropositivity of Varicella zoster virus in vaccinated Korean children and MAV vaccine group.,"In 2005, a single-dose varicella vaccination was incorporated into the national immunization program in Korea. Although the Oka strain is the most commonly circulating Varicella zoster virus (VZV) genotype in Korea, a domestically manufactured vaccine based on the MAV strain is widely distributed in Korea. High vaccination coverage was achieved, but breakthrough infections were frequently reported. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to analyze the maintenance of immunity after single-dose vaccination and to compare the immunity provided by the MAV and Oka vaccines. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of samples from 715 vaccinated Korean children were used to assess seropositivity rates against VZV. Additionally, fluorescent-antibody-to-membrane-antigen (FAMA) tests were performed in 35 individuals in the MAV vaccine group, and seropositivity rates against the Oka strain were determined. The progressive decrease of the seropositivity rate was demonstrated from ages 1 to 4 as follows: 65% in age 1, 59% in age 2, 53% in age 3, 49% in age 4. It then increased to 62% in age 5 and 70% in age 6. Both the MAV and Oka vaccine groups showed a progressive decrease of the seropositivity rate from the age of 1 to 4 years, but the MAV vaccine group had higher seropositivity rates. In FAMA test, the MAV group demonstrated 71% seropositivity against the Oka strain. This study indicates that immunity wanes after single-dose varicella vaccination and that the MAV vaccine is not inferior to the Oka vaccine in providing immunity against VZV. The MAV vaccine also induced cross-immunity against circulating Oka strain.","['Choi UY', 'Huh DH', 'Kim JH', 'Kang JH']",2016,12,10,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Choi UY, et al.

27476377,[Ecthyma gangrenosum of the eyelid after chickenpox].,"BACKGROUND: Ecthyma gangrenosum is an acute ulcer necrotic skin infection frequently caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is characterised by necrotic ulcerations circumscribed by an inflammatory halo. Lesions are normally found in the anal, genital and axillary regions. Ecthyma gangrenosum is most commonly seen in immunodepressed patients (cytotoxic chemotherapy, HIV infection, neutropenia or functional neutrophil deficiency, agammaglobulinemia). It is a rarely described complication in chicken pox.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Herein we report the case of a girl aged 2 ½ years presenting in our dermatology department with ecthyma gangrenosum on the right upper eyelid secondary to varicella. The disease course was marked by fibrous scarring of the inner canthus with ptosis of the right upper eyelid. The retractile scarring caused disability.
DISCUSSION: There have been previous reports of the contribution of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to the appearance of necrotic cutaneous super infections during the course of chickenpox. The occurrence of such complications on an eyelid may be harmful not only for the function of the eye but it can also cause extensive aesthetic impairment. Subsequent aesthetic and functional impairment may be improved by corrective surgery.","['Ouédraogo MS', 'Korsaga Somé N', 'Tapsoba GP', 'Ouédraogo AN', 'Sondo KA', 'Inouss IA', 'Sanou ML', 'Konsem T', 'Sakandé J', 'Barro Traoré F', 'Niamba P', 'Traoré A']",2016,143,10,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Ouédraogo MS, et al.

All children had compromised anamnesis: prematurity, hypotrophy, chicken pox, frequent acute respiratory viral infections, intestinal infections, atopic dermatitis. The study was carried out to comprehensively evaluate conditions of intestinal and nasopharyngeal biotops in children residing in closed children’s institution - children’s home. The microbiological analysis of qualitative and quantitative composition of content of intestine and nasopharynx was implemented according standard techniques. The analysis established in 81.2±6.90% of examined children deficiency of Bifidobacterium flora, decreasing of level of population density of bifidobacteria up to 6.9±1.53% lg KOE/g, in 31.2±8.1% - deficiency of normal colibacillus, in 78.1±7.3% - increased level of opportunistic flora. The analysis also established high rate of isolation of Escherichia coli with decreased enzyme activity and in 28.1±7.9% - Escherichia coli with hemolytic activity. The enterococci were permanent participants of nasopharyngeal and intestinal biotop (58.6±8.7%). From opportunistic flora, in nasopharynx were registered pathogenic streptococci - S.pyogenes, S.pneumonia and also pathogenic fungi Candida andpoly-resistant strains S. aureus. The study results demonstrated characteristics of microbial ecology of intestinal and nasopharyngeal biotops of orphan children in conditions of children institution of closed type where the circulation of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms occurs intensively, including strains with high medicinal resistance. All this determines necessity to attribute alumni of children’s homes to risk group of infectious pathology and requires constant micro-ecological monitoring for timely correction of microbiocenoses.","['Nemchenko UM', 'Rakova EB', 'Savelkaieva MV', 'Serdiuk LV', 'Ivanova EI', 'Shabanova NM', 'Bukharova EV']",2016,61,8,Klin Lab Diagn,"Nemchenko UM, et al.

27455445,Immunogenicity and safety of different schedules of 2-dose varicella vaccination in China.,"We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of different time intervals for a second dose of varicella vaccine in children in Zhejiang Province, China. Participants had all received a first dose of varicella vaccine and were assigned to 4 groups according to age (2-7 years). A second dose of live attenuated varicella vaccine was administered 1 month, 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years after the first. A serology assay was conducted and fluorescent-antibody-to-membrane-antigen test performed to measure the antibody titers against varicella before and approximately 30 days after the second dose. Of 1,078 participants, most tolerated the second dose well. Age at first dose did not affect the response to vaccination. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) significantly differed between group 1 and all other groups, both before and after the second vaccination. The GMT for group 1 was higher than those for the other 3 groups prior to the second vaccination (GMT = 20.52, 14.68, 12.49, 12.29, respectively, p < 0.001 for all), while the opposite was true after the second vaccination (GMT = 51.14, 83.37, 85.01, 81.83, respectively, p < 0.001 for all). There was no significant difference in seropositive rate among the 4 groups prior to the second vaccination (p = 0.093), and these rates were all 100% after the second vaccination. The vaccine was well tolerated in healthy children, regardless of the timing of the second dose. GMTs showed a particularly high boost after the second dose when the interval between doses was more than 1 year.","['Deng X', 'Xu W', 'Yan R', 'Chen H', 'Shen W', 'Zhang M', 'Wu T', 'Xu B', 'He H', 'Ma Y']",2016,12,12,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Deng X, et al.

27450594,A Herpes Zoster Outbreak on the Sinai Peninsula.,"BACKGROUND: Infection with the varicella zoster virus, a type of herpesvirus, causes chickenpox in children and herpes zoster (commonly known as shingles) in adults.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two 20-year-old male Soldiers returned from an outpost with a rash consistent with herpes zoster. Two other Soldiers with whom they were in close had had a similar rash 2 weeks earlier, which had since resolved at the time of initial presentation. Management and Outcome: Both Soldiers were started on an antiviral regimen and released to duty. They reported progressive relief, but both Soldiers redeployed to the United States before complete resolution.
CONCLUSION: Herpes zoster cannot be transmitted from person to person. It is rare for young healthy people to become afflicted with it, let alone for two people to get it at the same time, which initially raised concern for infections mimicking herpes zoster. However, herpes zoster may be triggered by acute stress. Providers in deployed areas should consider the diagnosis in personnel who have had childhood varicella zoster infection (chickenpox).","['Acierto D', 'Savioli S', 'Studer NM']",2016,16,2,J Spec Oper Med,"Acierto D, et al.

27449329,"Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella seroprevalence in refugees in Germany in 2015.","PURPOSE: The current extent of migration poses emerging socio-economic and humanitarian challenges. Little is known on vaccination rates in migrants entering Europe, and the implementation of guidelines for serological testing and vaccination of refugees are pending.
METHODS: We conducted seroprevalence analyses for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) in 678 refugees coming to Germany during the current crisis.
RESULTS: The mean age of refugees was 28.8±11.4 years, and 76.1 % of subjects were male. Overall, IgG seronegativity was 7.4 % (95 % CI 5.5-9.6) for measles, 10.2 % (95 % CI 8.0-12.5) for mumps, 2.2 % (95 % CI 1.2-3.4) for rubella, and 3.3 % (95 % CI 1.9-4.9) for varicella. Seropositivity rates were age-dependent with considerably low values in children. For example, overall MMR immunity was 90.9 % (95 % CI 88.8-93.1), but only 73.1 % of minor aged refugees displayed complete seroprevalence against all three diseases, and only 68.9 % of children and adolescents were completely MMRV immune.
CONCLUSION: Our initial data set suggests overall satisfactory MMRV immunity in adult migrants coming to Europe, but the observed low MMRV seroprevalences in refugee children support thorough and prompt vaccination of young migrants entering Europe. Taken together, our data set underlines the urgent need to implement and validate vaccination guidelines for refugee care in the current crisis.","['Jablonka A', 'Happle C', 'Grote U', 'Schleenvoigt BT', 'Hampel A', 'Dopfer C', 'Hansen G', 'Schmidt RE', 'Behrens GM']",2016,44,6,Infection,"Jablonka A, et al.

27440893,"Varicella-Zoster Virus Activates CREB, and Inhibition of the pCREB-p300/CBP Interaction Inhibits Viral Replication In Vitro and Skin Pathogenesis In Vivo.","UNLABELLED: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus that causes varicella upon primary infection and zoster upon reactivation from latency in sensory ganglion neurons. The replication of herpesviruses requires manipulation of cell signaling pathways. Notably, CREB, a factor involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, is activated upon infection of T cells with VZV. Here, we report that VZV infection also induced CREB phosphorylation in fibroblasts and that XX-650-23, a newly identified inhibitor of the phosphorylated-CREB (pCREB) interaction with p300/CBP, restricted cell-cell spread of VZV in vitro CREB phosphorylation did not require the viral open reading frame 47 (ORF47) and ORF66 kinases encoded by VZV. Evaluating the biological relevance of these observations during VZV infection of human skin xenografts in the SCID mouse model of VZV pathogenesis showed both that pCREB was upregulated in infected skin and that treatment with XX-650-23 reduced infectious-virus production and limited lesion formation compared to treatment with a vehicle control. Thus, processes of CREB activation and p300/CBP binding are important for VZV skin infection and may be targeted for antiviral drug development.
IMPORTANCE: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a common pathogen that causes chicken pox and shingles. As with all herpesviruses, the infection is acquired for life, and the virus can periodically reactivate from latency. Although VZV infection is usually benign with few or no deleterious consequences, infection can be life threatening in immunocompromised patients. Otherwise healthy elderly individuals who develop zoster as a consequence of viral reactivation are at risk for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a painful and long-lasting complication. Current vaccines use a live attenuated virus that is usually safe but cannot be given to many immunodeficient patients and retains the capacity to establish latency and reactivate, causing zoster. Antiviral drugs are effective against severe VZV infections but have little impact on PHN. A better understanding of virus-host cell interactions is relevant for developing improved therapies to safely interfere with cellular processes that are crucial for VZV pathogenesis.","['François S', 'Sen N', 'Mitton B', 'Xiao X', 'Sakamoto KM', 'Arvin A']",2016,90,19,J Virol,"François S, et al.

27440875,Deep Sequencing of Distinct Preparations of the Live Attenuated Varicella-Zoster Virus Vaccine Reveals a Conserved Core of Attenuating Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms.,"UNLABELLED: The continued success of the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine in preventing varicella-zoster and herpes zoster is well documented, as are many of the mutations that contribute to the attenuation of the vOka virus for replication in skin. At least three different preparations of vOka are marketed. Here, we show using deep sequencing of seven batches of vOka vaccine (including ZostaVax, VariVax, VarilRix, and the Oka/Biken working seed) from three different manufacturers (VariVax, GSK, and Biken) that 137 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations are present in all vaccine batches. This includes six sites at which the vaccine allele is fixed or near fixation, which we speculate are likely to be important for attenuation. We also show that despite differences in the vaccine populations between preparations, batch-to-batch variation is minimal, as is the number and frequency of mutations unique to individual batches. This suggests that the vaccine manufacturing processes are not introducing new mutations and that, notwithstanding the mixture of variants present, VZV live vaccines are extremely stable.
IMPORTANCE: The continued success of vaccinations to prevent chickenpox and shingles, combined with the extremely low incidence of adverse reactions, indicates the quality of these vaccines. The vaccine itself is comprised of a heterogeneous live attenuated virus population and thus requires deep-sequencing technologies to explore the differences and similarities in the virus populations between different preparations and batches of the vaccines. Our data demonstrate minimal variation between batches, an important safety feature, and provide new insights into the extent of the mutations present in this attenuated virus.","['Depledge DP', 'Yamanishi K', 'Gomi Y', 'Gershon AA', 'Breuer J']",2016,90,19,J Virol,"Depledge DP, et al.

Here, we discuss the Bayesian approach to data assimilation in the case of a two-state age-structured model. Such models are frequently used to explore the disease dynamics (i.e. force of infection) based on prevalence data collected at several time points. We demonstrate that, in the case when the explicit solution to the model equation is known, accounting for the data collection process in the Bayesian framework allows us to obtain an unbiased posterior distribution for the parameters determining the force of infection. We further show analytically and through numerical tests that the posterior distribution of these parameters is stable with respect to a cohort approximation (Escalator Boxcar Train) of the solution. Finally, we apply the technique to calibrate the model based on observed sero-prevalence of varicella in Poland.","['Gwiazda P', 'Miasojedow B', 'Rosińska M']",2016,407,,J Theor Biol,"Gwiazda P, et al.

27396221,Prevalence and Outcome of Disseminated Varicella Zoster Infection Post Kidney Transplantation.,"OBJECTIVE: Varicella zoster (VZV) is a potentially life-threatening infection after kidney transplantation (KT) but data on the incidence and outcome of late KT VZV infection is limited.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study of disseminated VZV infection (D-VZV) in post KT patients was conducted between 2003 and 2013. Acyclovir prophylaxis was given routinely for six months after KT Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software version 17.0.
RESULTS: Prevalence of D-VZV was 2% [22/1,032 patients]. Patients median age were 40 (21-67) years old and 12 (55%) were male. Timing of the infection was mostly (68.2%) late (> 1 year) post KT The majority of maintenance immunosuppressive drug included prednisolone (95.5%), cyclosporine (77.3%), mycophenolate (68.2%). Two (9.1%) had a recent VZV exposure and four (18%) received intensified immunosuppression before the diagnosis. Common clinical presentations were lymphopenia (54.5%), generalized vesicular rash (50%), and multi-dermatomal distribution (50%) while liver involvement was infrequent (9.1%). None had pneumonitis or neurological involvement. All cases received systemic acyclovir with the median duration of 14 (3-31) days. One had received IVIG for fulminant hepatitis. Immunosuppressive drug/s was reduced in 59%. Median duration of hospitalization was seven (3-37) days. None of patients died. The median follow-up duration was 1939 (IQR 804-2440) days. Recurrent infection was uncommon (4.5%). Secondary prophylaxis was given only in one patient with fulminant VZV hepatitis.
CONCLUSION: Incidence of D-VZV post KT was low. Treatments with intravenous acyclovir and reduction of immunosuppression without the use of VZV IgG provided favorable outcome in resource-limited settings.","['Chitasombat MN', 'Watcharananan SP']",2016,99,4,J Med Assoc Thai,Chitasombat MN and Watcharananan SP.

27391098,Vaccination Confidence and Parental Refusal/Delay of Early Childhood Vaccines.,"OBJECTIVE: To support efforts to address parental hesitancy towards early childhood vaccination, we sought to validate the Vaccination Confidence Scale using data from a large, population-based sample of U.S. parents.
METHODS: We used weighted data from 9,354 parents who completed the 2011 National Immunization Survey. Parents reported on the immunization history of a 19- to 35-month-old child in their households. Healthcare providers then verified children's vaccination status for vaccines including measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), varicella, and seasonal flu. We used separate multivariable logistic regression models to assess associations between parents' mean scores on the 8-item Vaccination Confidence Scale and vaccine refusal, vaccine delay, and vaccination status.
RESULTS: A substantial minority of parents reported a history of vaccine refusal (15%) or delay (27%). Vaccination confidence was negatively associated with refusal of any vaccine (odds ratio [OR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.63) as well as refusal of MMR, varicella, and flu vaccines specifically. Negative associations between vaccination confidence and measures of vaccine delay were more moderate, including delay of any vaccine (OR = 0.81, 95% CI, 0.76-0.86). Vaccination confidence was positively associated with having received vaccines, including MMR (OR = 1.53, 95% CI, 1.40-1.68), varicella (OR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.42-1.66), and flu vaccines (OR = 1.32, 95% CI, 1.23-1.42).
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination confidence was consistently associated with early childhood vaccination behavior across multiple vaccine types. Our findings support expanding the application of the Vaccination Confidence Scale to measure vaccination beliefs among parents of young children.","['Gilkey MB', 'McRee AL', 'Magnus BE', 'Reiter PL', 'Dempsey AF', 'Brewer NT']",2016,11,7,PLoS One,"Gilkey MB, et al.

27376245,Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism among Varicella-Zoster Virus and identification of vaccine-specific sites.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a causative agent for chickenpox and zoster. Live attenuated vaccines have been developed based on Oka and MAV/06 strains. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of attenuation, complete genome sequences of vaccine and wild-type strains were compared and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was analyzed. ORF22 and ORF62 contained the highest number of SNPs. The detailed analysis of the SNPs suggested 24 potential vaccine-specific sites. All the mutational events found in vaccine-specific sites were transitional, and most of them were substitution of AT to GC pair. Interestingly, 18 of the vaccine-specific sites of the vaccine strains appeared to be genetically heterogeneous. The probability of a single genome of vaccine strain to contain all 24 vaccine-type sequences was calculated to be less than 4%. The average codon adaptation index (CAI) value of the vaccine strains was significantly lower than the CAI value of the clinical strains.","['Jeon JS', 'Won YH', 'Kim IK', 'Ahn JH', 'Shin OS', 'Kim JH', 'Lee CH']",2016,496,,Virology,"Jeon JS, et al.

27365942,Molar Incisor Hypomineralization: An Epidemiological Study with Prevalence and Etiological Factors in Indian Pediatric Population.,"AIMS: To determine the prevalence of molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) in Indian children and to analyze the possible etiological factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: First permanent molars and all permanent incisors were examined in 1,369 children aged 8 to 12 years. Examinations were performed by two calibrated observers. The subjects were evaluated using judgment criteria proposed by Weerheijm et al in 2003. The parents accompanying children were given a questionnaire regarding pre- and postnatal history of the children.
RESULTS: A total of 191 children were diagnosed with MIH with a prevalence of 13.9%. Chi-square/Fisher exact test was used to compare the dichotomous variables. The relative risk with its 95% confidence interval was calculated to find the risk of clinical infections, such as chicken pox, jaundice, renal disorders, cardiac disorders, and affected molars with sex and type of delivery. Pre- and postnatal history of infection in a child was significantly correlated with the prevalence of MIH.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MIH was 13.9% in the age group of 8 to 12 years. Prenatal and postnatal infections play an important role in hypomineralization of molars and incisors.

29926689,Antimicrobial Activities of Thai Traditional Remedy “Kheaw-Hom” and Its Plant Ingredients for Skin Infection Treatment in Chickenpox.,"BACKGROUND: Kheaw-Hom is a Thai traditional remedy which appears in the National List of Essential Medicines 2011. This remedy consists of eighteen Thai medicinal plants. It has long been used in folk medicine to treat fever, measles, chickenpox and skin infection, but there has been no scientific report on antimicrobial activities of this remedy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate antimicrobial activities of Kheaw-Hom remedy extracts and its plant ingredients.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Kheaw-Hom remedy and each of its plant ingredients were extracted by maceration in 95% ethanol and decoction in water to obtain ethanolic extract and aqueous extract, respectively. All extracts were tested for antimicrobial activities by microtiter plate-based assay to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC) values against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (DMST 20651), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and Candida albicans (ATCC 90028).
RESULTS: The ethanolic extract of Kheaw-Hom remedy showed antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis with MIC values of 0.625, 0.625 and 1.25 mg/ml, respectively and MMC values of 1.25, 0.625 and 2.5 mg/ml, respectively. Among all the ethanolic extracts of its plant ingredients, that of Mammea siamensis showed the highest activity with MIC values of 0.005, 0.005 and 0.039 mg/ml and MMC values of 0.005, 0.005 and 0.039 mg/ml, respectively. The weak activity against bacteria was found in the aqueous extract of some plant ingredients. The ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Kheaw-Hom remedy and the aqueous extract of its plant ingredients had no activity against C. albicans but the ethanolic extract of Sophora exigua showed the highest activities against Candida albicans with MIC values of 0.625 mg/ml and MMC values of 0.625 mg/ml.
CONCLUSION: The ethanolic extracts of Kheaw-Hom remedy had antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis that are causes of skin infection from chickenpox. These results support the use of Kheaw-Hom remedy for skin infection treatment in chickenpox.","['Sukkasem K', 'Panthong S', 'Itharat A']",2016,99 suupl 4,,J Med Assoc Thai,"Sukkasem K, et al.

Ophthalmological exam revealed bilateral acute retinal necrosis. As the patient was following a drug detoxification program, he was tested for HIV, HVB, HVC, and results highly positive. Immediate intravenous therapy with high doses of acyclovir and methylprednisolone was initiated, but the evolution was extremely severe resulting in necrotic retinal detachment. Surgery was performed in right eye, but no improvement of visual acuity was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The fulminant evolution of bilateral acute retinal necrosis and the lack of response to maximal intravenous therapy were clinical elements indicating coexistent immunosuppressive disease. Very severe acute retinal necrosis may occur in immunosuppressed patients, leading to blindness.","['Dascalu AM', 'Stana D', 'Popa-Cherecheanu A', 'Popa-Cherecheanu M', 'Serban D']",2016,60,3,Rom J Ophthalmol,"Dascalu AM, et al.

27355931,Seroprevalence and Risk Factors of Varicella Zoster Infection in Iranian Adolescents: A Multilevel Analysis; The CASPIAN-III Study.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the varicella zoster virus (VZV) immunity in Iranian adolescents. It was conducted as a primary study for vaccine implementation, and to investigate the association of climatic and socioeconomic factors with the epidemiology of this infection. In this cross- sectional study, anti VZV antibodies were measured in serum samples obtained in a national school-based health survey (CASPIAN- III). Association of demographic, socio-economic, and climate of the living region with the frequency of VZV was investigated by multivariate multilevel analysis. Overall, sera of 2753 individuals aged 10-18 were tested for VZV antibodies, from those 87.4% were positive. The prevalence was statistically different in four socio-geographic regions (P<0.001), varying between 85.24% in West region (mostly mountainous areas with cold climate) to 94.59% in Southeast region (subtropical climate). Among variables studied, only age and mean daily temperature of the living area were positively associated with the VZV seroprevalence. Our findings show that most Iranians develop immunity to VZV before the age of 10, but a substantial proportion of them are yet susceptible to the infection. Therefore, it seems that the best strategy to reduce the burden of the disease is to vaccinate high- risk adults, i.e. those without a history of varicella infection. The regional temperature might be the only determinant of VZV epidemiology in Iran.","['Hoseini SG', 'Kelishadi R', 'Kasaeian A', 'Ataei B', 'Yaran M', 'Motlagh ME', 'Heshmat R', 'Ardalan G', 'Safari O', 'Qorbani M', 'Mostafavi SN']",2016,11,6,PLoS One,"Hoseini SG, et al.

27351567,Incidence and consequences of varicella in children treated for cancer in Guatemala.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in immune-compromised children, despite treatment with antiviral agents. Universal varicella vaccine programs have significantly decreased this risk in many highincome countries, but in most low-income and middleincome countries, the burden of varicella in children treated for malignancy is poorly defined.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of children at the National Unit of Pediatric Oncology (UNOP) in Guatemala diagnosed with varicella between January 2009 and March 2013 in order to calculate incidence of varicella and evaluate morbidity, mortality, treatment interruption, and cost.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine cases of varicella were identified. Incidence was 23.4 cases per 1000 person-years (p-y). 66.1% of cases occurred in children with leukemia (median age 5.2 years; interquantile range 3.4-7 years) and 41.0% of these occurred during maintenance therapy. Source of exposure was identified for 14/59 (23.7%) children. Most were hospitalized (71.2%) and given intravenous acyclovir (64.4%). Eight (13.6%) children required critical care, and two (3.4%) died from disseminated varicella with multiorgan failure. Chemotherapy was delayed or omitted due to varicella in 50%. No significant differences in outcomes based on nutritional and immunologic status were detected. The minimum average cost of treatment per episode was 598.75 USD.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella is a significant problem in children treated for cancer in Guatemala, where effective post-exposure prophylaxis is limited. In the absence of universal varicella vaccination, strategies to improve recognition of exposure and the future use of novel inactivated vaccines currently under investigation in clinical trials could mitigate this burden.","['Brown AEC', 'Asturias EJ', 'Melgar M', 'Antillon-Klussmann FA', 'Mettler P', 'Levin MJ']",2016,12,3,World J Pediatr,"Brown AEC, et al.

27337486,Herpes Simplex Virus and Varicella-Zoster Virus.,"The most common specimens from immunocompromised patients that are analyzed for detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are from skin lesions. Many types of assays are applicable to these samples, but some, such as virus isolation and direct fluorescent antibody testing, are useful only in the early phases of the lesions. In contrast, nucleic acid (NA) detection methods, which generally have superior sensitivity and specificity, can be applied to skin lesions at any stage of progression. NA methods are also the best choice, and sometimes the only choice, for detecting HSV or VZV in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous or vitreous humor, and from mucosal surfaces. NA methods provide the best performance when reliability and speed (within 24 hours) are considered together. They readily distinguish the type of HSV detected or the source of VZV detected (wild type or vaccine strain). Nucleic acid detection methods are constantly being improved with respect to speed and ease of performance. Broader applications are under study, such as the use of quantitative results of viral load for prognosis and to assess the efficacy of antiviral therapy.","['Levin MJ', 'Weinberg A', 'Schmid DS']",2016,4,3,Microbiol Spectr,"Levin MJ, et al.

An assessment of the impact of this programme on varicella-related hospitalisations 4 years after its introduction could further support its adoption at a national level. The hospitalisation data were analysed in two periods: pre-vaccination (2004-2007) and vaccination period (2009-2012). The high coverage of the vaccines (84% in 2012) resulted in a significant decline in notifications, from 33,114 (2004-2007) to 13,184 cases (2009-2012), and also of hospitalisations, from 584 (pre-vaccination period) to 325 (vaccination period). The hospitalisation rate was 4.1 per 100,000 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 3.4-4.7) before the introduction of vaccination, which dropped to 2.2 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.7-2.7) in the vaccination period (hospitalisation risk ratios: 0.54; 95% CI:  0.472-0.619). The reduction was most significant in the youngest age groups. The introduction of universal vaccination has already led to a significant decline in hospitalisations due to varicella after just 4 years of implementation. Hospitalisation rates fell noticeably among younger individuals involved in the vaccination programme.

METHODS: We analysed the incidence, duration, outcome and costs of hospitalisations for VZV using the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database for the general and immunocompetent population. Mortality in HES was validated using data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
RESULTS: The average annual incidences of admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster were 7.6 (7.3-7.9) and 8.8 (8.6-9.0) per 100,000, respectively. The immunocompetent population accounted for 93% and 82% of the admissions due to varicella and herpes zoster, respectively. The average yearly number of hospital days was 10,748 (10,227-11,234) for varicella and 41,780 (40,257-43,287) for herpes zoster. The average yearly hospital costs (£2013/14) were £6.8 million (6.4-7.2) for varicella and £13.0 million (12.8-13.4) for herpes zoster. The average annual numbers of deaths identified in HES due to varicella and herpes zoster were 18.5 (14.3-22.8) and 160 (147-172), respectively.

Herpesvirus fusion is mediated by a complex of glycoproteins gB and gH-gL, which are necessary and sufficient for VZV to induce membrane fusion. However, the cellular requirements of fusion are poorly understood. Integrins have been implicated to facilitate entry of several human herpesviruses, but their role in VZV entry has not yet been explored. To determine the involvement of integrins in VZV fusion, a quantitative cell-cell fusion assay was developed using a VZV-permissive melanoma cell line. The cells constitutively expressed a reporter protein and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knock down the expression of integrin subunits shown to be expressed in these cells by RNA sequencing. The αV integrin subunit was identified as mediating VZV gB/gH-gL fusion, as its knockdown by shRNAs reduced fusion levels to 60% of that of control cells. A comparable reduction in fusion levels was observed when an anti-αV antibody specific to its extracellular domain was tested in the fusion assay, confirming that the domain was important for VZV fusion. In addition, reduced spread was observed in αV knockdown cells infected with the VZV pOka strain relative to that of the control cells. This was demonstrated by reductions in plaque size, replication kinetics, and virion entry in the αV subunit knockdown cells. Thus, the αV integrin subunit is important for VZV gB/gH-gL fusion and infection.
IMPORTANCE: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a highly infectious pathogen that causes chickenpox and shingles. A common complication of shingles is the excruciating condition called postherpetic neuralgia, which has proven difficult to treat. While a vaccine is now available, it is not recommended for immunocompromised individuals and its efficacy decreases with the recipient's age. These limitations highlight the need for new therapies. This study examines the role of integrins in membrane fusion mediated by VZV glycoproteins gB and gH-gL, a required process for VZV infection. This knowledge will further the understanding of VZV entry and provide insight into the development of better therapies.","['Yang E', 'Arvin AM', 'Oliver SL']",2016,90,16,J Virol,"Yang E, et al.

27271649,"An Evaluation of Voluntary Varicella Vaccination Coverage in Zhejiang Province, East China.","BACKGROUND: In 2014 a 2-doses varicella vaccine (VarV) schedule was recommended by the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We aimed to assess the coverage of the 1st dose of VarV (VarV₁) and the 2nd dose of VarV (VarV₂) among children aged 2-6 years through the Zhejiang Provincial Immunization Information System (ZJIIS) and to explore the determinants associated with the VarV coverage.
METHODS: Children aged 2-6 years (born from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013) registered in ZJIIS were enrolled. Anonymized individual records of target children were extracted from the ZJIIS database on 1 January 2016, including their VarV and (measles-containing vaccine) MCV vaccination information. The VarV₁ and VarV₂ coverage rates were evaluated for each birth cohorts. The coverage of VarV also was estimated among strata defined by cities, gender and immigration status. We also evaluated the difference in coverage between VarV and MCV.
RESULTS: A total of 3,028,222 children aged 2-6 years were enrolled. The coverage of VarV₁ ranged from 84.8% to 87.9% in the 2009-2013 birth cohorts, while the coverage of VarV₂ increased from 31.8% for the 2009 birth cohort to 48.7% for the 2011 birth cohort. Higher coverage rates for both VarV₁ and VarV₂ were observed among resident children in relevant birth cohorts. The coverage rates of VarV₁ and VarV₂ were lower than those for the 1st and 2nd dose of MCV, which were above 95%. The proportion of children who were vaccinated with VarV₁ at the recommended age increased from 34.6% for the 2009 birth cohort to 75.2% for the 2013 birth cohort, while the proportion of children who were vaccinated with VarV₂ at the recommended age increased from 19.7% for the 2009 birth cohort to 48.7% for the 2011 birth cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a rapid increasing VarV₂ coverage of children, indicating a growing acceptance of the 2-doses VarV schedule among children's caregivers and physicians after the new recommendation released. We highlighted the necessity for a 2-doses VarV vaccination school-entry requirement to achieve the high coverage of >90% and to eliminate disparities in coverage among sub-populations. We also recommended continuous monitoring of the VarV coverage via ZJIIS over time.","['Hu Y', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang B', 'Li Q']",2016,13,6,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Hu Y, et al.

Therefore the current Swiss vaccination recommendations against varicella include a general recommendation for 11 to 15 year old adolescents with a negative varicella history, as well as a specific recommendation for risk groups. The goal of both recommendations is to reduce varicella complications in persons most at risk. The vaccine is not universally recommended for all toddlers in Switzerland, while this is the case in some countries such as the United States. Pros and cons of different vaccination strategies, as well as possible short- and long-term effects on herpes zoster incidence are taken into account. In the United States, there was a marked decline in incidence and hospitalisations, but an increased herpes zoster incidence in the short term.

27266273,Varicella-zoster virus susceptibility and primary healthcare consultations in Norway.,"BACKGROUND: Currently Norway does not recommend universal varicella vaccination for healthy children. This study assessed susceptibility to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the Norwegian population for the first time.
METHODS: A national convenience sample of residual sera was tested for anti-VZV IgG by ELISA. We estimated age-specific seropositivity to VZV, controlling for sex and geographical distribution. We assessed differences between the proportions using the chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression. Seroprevalence data were compared to the varicella and herpes zoster-associated consultation rates in patients attending primary healthcare.
RESULTS: Although 73.2 % (n = 1,540) of all samples were positive for VZV, only 11.2 % of samples collected from 1-year-olds were seropositive. There was a sharp increase in the proportion of seropositive in 3- and 5-year-olds (40.2 % and 65.4 %, respectively). By the school entry age of 6 years, 69.8 % of children were seropositive. The age-specific annual consultation rate for varicella in primary healthcare peaked in 1-year-olds, with 2,627 cases per 100,000 population. The profile of varicella-related consultations in primary healthcare mirrored the VZV seropositivity profile. The herpes zoster-related consultations in primary healthcare peaked in people over 70 years of age (702 cases per 100,000 population).
CONCLUSIONS: VZV seroprevalence in Norway was somewhat lower than in some other European countries. The age-specific varicella-related consultation rates in primary healthcare mirrored the age profile of VZV seroprevalence.","['Rimseliene G', 'Vainio K', 'Gibory M', 'Salamanca BV', 'Flem E']",2016,16,,BMC Infect Dis,"Rimseliene G, et al.

27256096,Clinical course and therapeutic approach to varicella zoster virus infection in children with rheumatic autoimmune diseases under immunosuppression.,"BACKGROUND: To analyze the clinical presentation and complications of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection in children with rheumatic diseases treated with immunosuppressive medication such as biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and/or conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), and to analyze the therapeutic approach to VZV infections with respect to the concomitant immunosuppressive treatment.
METHODS: Retrospective multicenter study using the Swiss Pediatric Rheumatology registry. Children with rheumatic diseases followed in a Swiss center for pediatric rheumatology and treated with cDMARD and/or bDMARD with a clinical diagnosis of varicella or herpes zoster between January 2004 and December 2013 were included.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were identified, of whom 20 were treated for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 1 for a polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type III, and 1 for uveitis. Of these 22 patients, 16 had varicella and 6 had herpes zoster. Median age at VZV disease was 7.6 years (range 2 to 17 years), with 6.3 years (range 2 to 17 years) for those with varicella and 11.6 years (range 5 to 16 years) for those with herpes zoster. The median interval between start of immunosuppression and VZV disease was 14.1 months (range 1 to 63 months). Two patients had received varicella vaccine (1 dose each) prior to start of immunosuppression. Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy was methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy (n = 9) or bDMARD monotherapy (n = 2), or a combination of bDMARD with prednisone, MTX or Leflunomide (n = 11). Four patients experienced VZV related complications: cellulitis in 1 patient treated with MTX, and cellulitis, sepsis and cerebellitis in 3 patients treated with biological agents and MTX combination therapy. Six children were admitted to hospital (range of duration: 4 to 9 days) and 12 were treated with valaciclovir or aciclovir.
CONCLUSION: The clinical course of varicella and herpes zoster in children under immunosuppression is variable, with 4 (18 %) of 22 children showing a complicated course. Thorough assessment of VZV disease and vaccination history and correct VZV vaccination according to national guidelines at diagnosis of a rheumatic autoimmune disease is essential to minimize VZV complications during a later immunosuppressive treatment.","['Leuvenink R', 'Aeschlimann F', 'Baer W', 'Berthet G', 'Cannizzaro E', 'Hofer M', 'Kaiser D', 'Schroeder S', 'Heininger U', 'Woerner A']",2016,14,1,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,"Leuvenink R, et al.

OBJECTIVE AND CONCLUSION: We present a case of basal cell carcinoma arising in a leishmania scar on the nose, sixty years after the primary lesion. Although rare, BCC's have arisen in leishmania scars. Thus the possibility of basal cell carcinoma should be considered while dealing with such patients.

27247405,Digital epidemiology reveals global childhood disease seasonality and the effects of immunization.,"Public health surveillance systems are important for tracking disease dynamics. In recent years, social and real-time digital data sources have provided new means of studying disease transmission. Such affordable and accessible data have the potential to offer new insights into disease epidemiology at national and international scales. We used the extensive information repository Google Trends to examine the digital epidemiology of a common childhood disease, chicken pox, caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), over an 11-y period. We (i) report robust seasonal information-seeking behavior for chicken pox using Google data from 36 countries, (ii) validate Google data using clinical chicken pox cases, (iii) demonstrate that Google data can be used to identify recurrent seasonal outbreaks and forecast their magnitude and seasonal timing, and (iv) reveal that VZV immunization significantly dampened seasonal cycles in information-seeking behavior. Our findings provide strong evidence that VZV transmission is seasonal and that seasonal peaks show remarkable latitudinal variation. We attribute the dampened seasonal cycles in chicken pox information-seeking behavior to VZV vaccine-induced reduction of seasonal transmission. These data and the methodological approaches provide a way to track the global burden of childhood disease and illustrate population-level effects of immunization. The global latitudinal patterns in outbreak seasonality could direct future studies of environmental and physiological drivers of disease transmission.","['Bakker KM', 'Martinez-Bakker ME', 'Helm B', 'Stevenson TJ']",2016,113,24,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Bakker KM, et al.

27198935,The Role of Childhood Infections and Immunizations on Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma: A Report From the Children's Oncology Group.,"BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare, highly malignant tumor arising from primitive mesenchymal cells that differentiate into skeletal muscle. Relatively little is known about RMS susceptibility. Based on growing evidence regarding the role of early immunologic challenges on RMS development, we evaluated the role of infections and immunizations on this clinically significant pediatric malignancy.
PROCEDURE: RMS cases (n = 322) were enrolled from the third trial coordinated by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group. Population-based controls (n = 322) were pair matched to cases on race, sex, and age. The following immunizations were assessed: diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT); measles, mumps, and rubella; and oral polio vaccine. We also evaluated if immunizations were complete versus incomplete. We examined selected infections including chickenpox, mumps, pneumonia, scarlet fever, rubella, rubeola, pertussis, mononucleosis, and lung infections. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each exposure, adjusted for maternal education and total annual income.
RESULTS: Incomplete immunization schedules (OR = 5.30, 95% CI: 2.47-11.33) and incomplete DPT immunization (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.06-2.29) were positively associated with childhood RMS. However, infections did not appear to be associated with childhood RMS.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study of RMS to date demonstrating a possible protective effect of immunizations against the development of childhood RMS. Further studies are needed to validate our findings. Our findings add to the growing body of literature, suggesting a protective role of routine vaccinations in childhood cancer and specifically in childhood RMS.","['Sankaran H', 'Danysh HE', 'Scheurer ME', 'Okcu MF', 'Skapek SX', 'Hawkins DS', 'Spector LG', 'Erhardt EB', 'Grufferman S', 'Lupo PJ']",2016,63,9,Pediatr Blood Cancer,"Sankaran H, et al.

27178889,Asthma and risk of breakthrough varicella infection in children.,"BACKGROUND: We recently reported a more rapid waning of vaccine-induced humoral immunity (measles vaccine) in children with asthma. It is unknown if asthma affects susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether asthma is associated with an increased risk of vaccine-preventable disease, e.g., breakthrough varicella infection.
METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based case-control study that examined cases of breakthrough varicella among children between 2005 and 2011. Children with a diagnosis of breakthrough varicella infection in Olmsted County, Minnesota (infection of >42 days after vaccination) between 2005 and 2011 and two age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled for each case. Asthma status was determined by using predetermined criteria. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate matched odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: Of the 165 cases and their 330 matched controls, 48% were boys and the mean (standard deviation) age at the index date was 6.6 ± 3.5 years for both cases and controls. Of the 330 controls, 80 (24%) had two doses of the varicella vaccine compared with only 23 (14%) of the 165 cases (OR 0.29 [95% CI, 0.14-0.61]; p = 0.001). Children with a history of asthma ever had a higher risk of developing breakthrough varicella compared with those without a history of asthma (adjusted OR 1.63 [95% CI, 1.04-2.55]; p = 0.032) when adjusting for elapsed time since the first varicella vaccination and the number of varicella vaccine doses.
CONCLUSIONS: A history of asthma might be an unrecognized risk factor for breakthrough varicella infection. Children with asthma should follow the two-dose varicella vaccine policy.","['Umaretiya PJ', 'Swanson JB', 'Kwon HJ', 'Grose C', 'Lohse CM', 'Juhn YJ']",2016,37,3,Allergy Asthma Proc,"Umaretiya PJ, et al.

27173398,A study on viral CNS inflammation beyond herpes encephalitis.,"The early diagnosis of herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) enables induction of antiviral therapy in this potentially life-threatening disease. The study aimed to determine clinical findings including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data and MRI imaging in HSVE patients and to identify features distinguishing HSVE from encephalitis of other viral etiologies. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who were diagnosed with viral encephalitis between 2000 and 2014 at the University Hospital Halle. Forty-nine patients with viral encephalitis were identified. A viral etiology could be confirmed by PCR or antibody testing in 22/49 (44.9 %) of patients (15 (30.6 %) HSV, 5 (10.2 %) VZV, 2 (4.1 %) EBV). In HSVE, typical findings were focal slowing in electroencephalophy (EEG) (80 %, p = 0.021) and presence of cortical (86.7 %, p = 0.030) lesions in MRI. Restricted diffusion was particularly helpful in detection of early signal abnormalities in HSVE (p = 0.014). In 27/49 (55.1 %) of patients, no causative agent could be elucidated. In these patients, 15/27 (55.6 %) experienced a rather ""benign"" disease course with no MRI pathology despite initially HSVE mimicking clinical picture. However, CSF was significantly different showing a higher amount of granulocytes and activated lymphocytes. The remaining 12/27 (44.4 %) patients developed MRI changes consistent with encephalitis, in 4 of these patients, disease course was fatal. Beside PCR-based serology as standard procedure, MRI including diffusion-weighted images and EEG represent additional tools in early HSVE diagnosis.

The LSD vaccine-derived sample was positive for VP1 and VP2 in conventional PCR. The SP vaccine-derived sample was examined by amplification of VP1, VP4, VP6, VP7, NS2 and NS3 gene segments in conventional PCR. The SP vaccine-derived sample was further propagated in embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) and Vero cells. Preliminary sequence analysis showed that the LSD vaccine-derived sequence was 98-99% similar to BTV9. Analysis of the six genomic segments from the SP vaccine-derived isolate showed the highest similarity to BTV26 (66.3-97.8%). These findings are particularly important due to the effect of BTV on cattle and sheep, for which the vaccines are intended. They also demonstrate the necessity of rigorous vaccine inspection and strict vaccine production control.","['Bumbarov V', 'Golender N', 'Erster O', 'Khinich Y']",2016,34,28,Vaccine,"Bumbarov V, et al.

27167117,Adverse Events After MMR or MMRV Vaccine in Infants Under Nine Months Old.,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, measles is resurging, with more than 700 confirmed cases since January 2014. During measles outbreaks, vaccination as early as at 6 months of age is sometimes recommended for infants who are at risk for exposure.
METHODS: We searched the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for reports of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine combined or measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine combined vaccination in children less than 9 months of age. We performed a clinical assessment of each report and summarized the frequency, range, onset time and severity of adverse events.
RESULTS: After excluding 346 reports because they were duplicates or because they contained insufficient information about the child's age or vaccine(s), we retained 204 reports in the analysis, including 35 (17%) that were serious. Among the 169 nonserious reports, more than half (88; 52%) described a vaccination error without any adverse event per se. Other nonserious reports described fever, injection reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Serious adverse events included developmental disorders, fever and fussiness. There were 44 reports of fever, but only 4 cases began 5-12 days after immunization, the peak risk window. The vast majority of fever reports listed concomitant vaccines, such as diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular or whole-cell pertussis vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: This review did not identify any major safety concerns. These findings may facilitate discussions about the risks and benefits of vaccinating infants who are potentially exposed to this life-threatening disease.","['Woo EJ', 'Winiecki SK', 'Arya D', 'Beeler J']",2016,35,8,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Woo EJ, et al.

27160039,Development of varicella vaccine in Japan and future prospects.,"In Japan, Dr. Michiaki Takahashi (1928-2013) successfully developed the first live attenuated varicella vaccine in the world. The virus used for this vaccine was varicella-zoster virus isolated from the vesicular fluid of a child with typical varicella and it was named the Oka strain after the family name of the child. In 1974, a patient with nephrosis developed varicella in the Pediatric Ward, and uninfected pediatric patients received varicella vaccine immediately. As a result, there were no cases of varicella in the other children and all of the vaccinated children acquired immunity to the disease. These results were published in the Lancet, demonstrating the safety and efficacy of varicella Oka strain vaccine for the first time. When clinical studies were conducted at the start of vaccine development, most of the subjects were pediatric patients with a high risk of contracting severe varicella. Therefore, the development process was different from that for other vaccines, since clinical studies are generally performed in healthy individuals. This vaccine was approved in Japan in 1986, and voluntary single-dose vaccination for children aged 1 year or older was started in 1987. However, the vaccination coverage rate remained low and the number of patients with varicella did not decrease significantly. Due to its voluntary status, the cost of vaccination was borne by the child's family and this was considered to be a reason for the low coverage rate. Moreover, although the vaccine achieved a good antibody response, the number of cases of breakthrough varicella (BV) was relatively high and showed an increasing trend that was also a concern. In order to increase the coverage rate and reduce BV, the Japanese government changed the varicella vaccination policy from voluntary to routine vaccination in October 2014. At the same time, a two-dose schedule was introduced that involved administration of the vaccine twice at an interval of at least 3 months up to the age of 3 years. At present, cases of varicella are only monitored at the pediatric sentinel clinics in Japan. Therefore, we need to establish a system to survey all patients, in order to demonstrate the efficacy of varicella vaccine based on detailed surveillance data. We also need to investigate the optimum timing of the second dose of the vaccine and the necessity for further booster vaccination. A combined live vaccine containing varicella vaccine has not yet been approved in Japan. Because of the greater convenience of combined vaccines, development and introduction of such a vaccine in the future would be desirable. Routine varicella vaccination is also expected to eventually reduce the occurrence of herpes zoster, although there are no supporting epidemiological data. The prevalence of herpes zoster has attracted attention, but it is necessary to develop a surveillance system for this disease. In March 2016, use of varicella vaccine to prevent herpes zoster in adults aged 50 years or older was approved in Japan, and the results of this policy change need to be assessed.","['Ozaki T', 'Asano Y']",2016,34,29,Vaccine,Ozaki T and Asano Y.

27148763,Modeling and predicting the long-term effects of various strategies and objectives of varicella-zoster vaccination campaigns.,"BACKGROUND: Susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) models are increasingly developed and used, but their simplicity contrasts with the wide variety of scenarios before launching vaccination campaigns.
METHODS: We investigated the effects of some model-building choices (targets, pace, coverage rate) on the results of SEIR models in the case of vaccination against varicella and herpes zoster.
RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated the need for a progressive unvaccinated to vaccinated transition and a dynamic system-equilibrium before vaccination onset. When several doses are considered, new compartments are needed to account for vaccination histories. For varicella, the delay to reach the expected coverage rate and the pace until reaching this rate have significant impacts, especially on the short-term incidence. The impact of vaccination through herd immunity should be systematically investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: Graphs help understanding the progress of instantaneous incidence; however, tables of cumulative average incidence over decades should be preferred because of higher stability.","['Riche B', 'Bricout H', 'Kürzinger ML', 'Roche S', 'Iwaz J', 'Etard JF', 'Ecochard R']",2016,15,7,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Riche B, et al.

27140829,Molar-incisor hypomineralization and the association with childhood illnesses and antibiotics in a group of Finnish children.,"OBJECTIVE: Molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is a developmental enamel defect affecting 1-4 first permanent molars (FPMs) and often also incisors. The aim of this study was to assess whether childhood illnesses or medication are associated with MIH.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: FPMs and incisors of 287 Finnish children were examined for MIH in line with the criteria of the EAPD. Health data from the first 3 years of life was collected from medical records and the associations with MIH and MIH2 (lesions in at least one FPM and incisor) were assessed using simple and multiple logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: The prevalence of MIH and MIH2 were 11.5% and 6.3%, respectively. During the first 3 years of life, the children with MIH had sought care for infectious illnesses more often than the children without MIH (mean number of visits (SD) 7.9(6.4) vs. 6.0(5.1), p = 0.045, independent samples t-test). After adjustment for confounding factors, children who had received penicillin or macrolides within the first year, or amoxicillin within the first 3 years had a higher risk for MIH (2.61, 4.07 and 2.58 times, adjusted OR, respectively) or MIH2 (3.16 times, aOR for penicillin and amoxicillin) compared to those who had not received that antibiotic. Of the illnesses, children with at least one episode of otitis within the first year had a higher risk for MIH (2.28 times, aOR) than those who had not suffered from otitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute otitis media and the use of certain antibiotics were associated with the elevated risk of MIH/MIH2.","['Wuollet E', 'Laisi S', 'Salmela E', 'Ess A', 'Alaluusua S']",2016,74,5,Acta Odontol Scand,"Wuollet E, et al.

After the initial infection, it remains latent but can reactivate, resulting in shingles (herpes zoster). Previous reports have implicated VZV in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis, but the involvement of the virus has not been investigated fully. The present case describes a patient who suffered from a severe episode of shingles and subsequently developed periapical radiolucencies of all the teeth in the affected nerve distribution. Molecular and culture techniques showed the presence of VZV DNA in the root canal system in the absence of bacteria. This confirms that VZV can cause localized pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. The lesions healed after endodontic treatment, implying chemomechanical debridement using sodium hypochlorite irrigation and a calcium hydroxide interim dressing may be effective against the virus.","['Patel K', 'Schirru E', 'Niazi S', 'Mitchell P', 'Mannocci F']",2016,42,6,J Endod,"Patel K, et al.

VZV reactivation, even decades after primary infection, causes herpes zoster. In healthy immunocompetent subjects, children in particular, varicella results in mild to moderate illness and for this reason, regardless its high morbidity, it is not considered a public health priority. Varicella still represents the most widespread vaccine preventable childhood infectious disease in industrialized countries; due to its relevant burden on healthcare resources several countries has introduced varicella vaccination into the recommended routine childhood national immunization schedule. Nowadays, live attenuated monovalent and combined MMRV vaccines are licensed worldwide. The use of several millions of doses has demonstrated the excellent safety and efficacy level of varicella vaccines as well as of combined MMRV vaccines. Universal vaccination adopted in many countries with a two-dose strategy has allowed to significantly reducing morbidity and mortality of this infectious disease. Anyway, an ample international debate is ongoing on the time range to be used between the two doses, and on the safety issues related to the use as first-dose of MMRV vaccine. Taking into account the availability of a zoster vaccine in subjects older than 50 years of age, it will be relevant to clarify if an impact on exogenous boosters and on the epidemiology of herpes zoster can occur after the adoption of extensive varicella immunization.","['Gabutti G', 'Franchi M', 'Maniscalco L', 'Stefanati A']",2016,68,3,Minerva Pediatr,"Gabutti G, et al.

The XVIth century is considered a period marked by artistic and scientific effervescence in the western part of Europe and Guido Guidi was a first order personality, grandson of Domenico Ghirlandaio and friend of Benvenuto Cellini. He was appointed by the King Francis I the first professor of anatomy and surgery at the newly founded College de France. On demand of the King, he wrote Chirurgia j Graeco in Latinum conversa Vido Vidio Florentino interprete, cum nonnullis eiusdem Vidii comentariis (1544), a beautifully illustrated original surgery book that became for the following two centuries the main source in teaching surgery. Our study realized a detailed assessment of the book and especially of its illustrations belonging to Francesco Salviati. Exploring the life of Guido Guidi, we were also able to point out other significant contributions in the field of anatomy and clinical medicine as De anatome the first book where are presented disarticulated, the bones of the skull base and also the discovery of the chickenpox. Some surgical personalities attributed to him both the elaboration of the term appendix vermiformis and the first description of an aneurysm, he treated with the help of Fallopio.

27104589,Family Characteristics Associated with Likelihood of Varicella Vaccination.,"CONTEXT: The introduction of the varicella vaccine as a routine pediatric immunization in the US, in 1995, provided an opportunity to assess factors associated with uptake of new vaccines in the member population of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) Health Plan.
OBJECTIVE: Identify factors associated with varicella vaccination in the KPNW population in the first five years after varicella vaccine was introduced.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort of children under age 13 years between June 1995 and December 1999, without a history of varicella disease was identified using KPNW automated data. Membership records were linked to vaccine databases. Cox regression was used to estimate likelihood of varicella vaccination during the study period in relation to age, sex, primary clinician's specialty, and Medicaid eligibility. For a subset whose parents answered a behavioral health survey, additional demographic and behavioral characteristics were evaluated.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Varicella vaccination.
RESULTS: We identified 88,646 children under age 13 years without a history of varicella; 22% were vaccinated during the study period. Varicella vaccination was more likely among children who were born after 1995, were not Medicaid recipients, or had pediatricians as primary clinicians. In the survey-linked cohort, positively associated family characteristics included smaller family size; higher socioeconomic status; and parents who were older, were college graduates, reported excellent health, and received influenza vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Understanding predictors of early varicella vaccine-era vaccine acceptance may help in planning for introduction of new vaccines to routine schedules.","['Weinmann S', 'Mullooly JP', 'Drew L', 'Chun CS']",2016,20,2,Perm J,"Weinmann S, et al.

27102884,"Association between the incidence of varicella and meteorological conditions in Jinan, Eastern China, 2012-2014.","BACKGROUND: Varicella remains an important public health issue in China. In this study we explored the effect of weather conditions on the incidence of varicella in the temperate city of Jinan, Eastern China during 2012-2014 to inform public health prevention and control measures.
METHODS: Data on reported cases of varicella were obtained from National Notifiable Disease Report System. Meteorological data for the same time period were obtained from the Jinan Meteorological Bureau. A negative binomial regression model was used to assess the relationships between meteorological variables and the incidence of varicella. Given collinearity between average temperature and atmospheric pressure, separate models were constructed: one including average temperature without atmospheric pressure, the other including atmospheric pressure but without average temperature. Both models included relative humidity, wind velocity, rainfall, sunshine, and year as independent variables.
RESULTS: Annual incidence rates of varicella were 44.47, 53.69, and 46.81 per 100,000 for 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Each increase of 100 Pa (hPa) in atmospheric pressure was estimated to be associated with an increase in weekly incidence of 3.35 % (95 % CI = 2.94-3.67 %), while a 1 °C rise in temperature was associated with a decrease of 3.44 % (95 % CI = -3.73-3.15 %) in the weekly incidence of varicella. Similarly, a 1 % rise in relative humidity corresponded to a decrease of 0.50 % or 1.00 %, a 1 h rise in sunshine corresponded to an increase of 1.10 % or 0.50 %, and a 1 mm rise in rainfall corresponded to an increase of 0.20 % or 0.30 %, in the weekly incidence of varicella cases, depending on the variable considered in the model.

27098823,Varicella zoster virus-associated morbidity and mortality in Africa: a systematic review protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Worldwide, these diseases are associated with significant morbidity. Most of the epidemiological data on VZV come from high income countries. There are few data on VZV in Africa, where tropical climates and high HIV/AIDS prevalence rates are expected to impact the epidemiology of VZV. Safe and effective vaccinations for both varicella and herpes zoster exist, but are not routinely used in Africa. There are very few data available on VZV disease burden in Africa to guide the introduction of these vaccines on the continent. Our aim is to conduct a systematic review of the VZV-associated morbidity and mortality in Africa, which will provide critical information that could be used to develop vaccination policies against these diseases in Africa.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Electronic databases will be searched and all studies published after 1974 that meet predefined criteria will be assessed. The primary outcomes for the study are VZV incidence/prevalence, hospitalisation rates and total death rates. The secondary outcome for this study is the proportion of VZV hospitalisations and/or deaths associated with HIV/AIDS. Two reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts, and then independently review the full texts, to determine if studies are eligible for inclusion. A risk of bias and quality assessment tool will be used to score all included studies. Following standardised data extraction, a trend analysis using R-programming software will be conducted to investigate the trend of VZV. Depending on the characteristics of included studies, subgroup analyses will be performed. This review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this is a protocol for a systematic review, which will use already published data, no ethics approval is required. Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals.

A multicentre case-control study in French tertiary care centres.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of invasive group A streptococcus (GAS) infections is increasing worldwide, whereas there has been a dramatic decrease in pneumococcal invasive diseases. Few data describing GAS pleural empyema in children are available.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and microbiological features, management and outcome of GAS pleural empyema in children and compare them with those of pneumococcal empyema.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Fifty children admitted for GAS pleural empyema between January 2006 and May 2013 to 8 hospitals participating in a national pneumonia survey were included in a descriptive study and matched by age and centre with 50 children with pneumococcal empyema.
RESULTS: The median age of the children with GAS pleural empyema was 2 (range 0.1-7.6) years. Eighteen children (36%) had at least one risk factor for invasive GAS infection (corticosteroid use and/or current varicella). On admission, 37 patients (74%) had signs of circulatory failure, and 31 (62%) had a rash. GAS was isolated from 49/50 pleural fluid samples and from one blood culture. The commonest GAS genotype was emm1 (n=17/22). Two children died (4%). Children with GAS empyema presented more frequently with a rash (p<0.01), signs of circulatory failure (p=0.01) and respiratory disorders (p=0.02) and with low leucocyte levels (p=0.04) than children with pneumococcal empyema. Intensive care unit admissions (p<0.01), drainage procedures (p=0.04) and short-term complications (p=0.01) were also more frequent in patients with GAS empyema.

27072500,[Infectious disease outbreaks in centralized homes for asylum seekers in Germany from 2004-2014].,"BACKGROUND: Migration and imported infections are changing the distribution of infectious diseases in Europe. However little is known about the extent of transmission of imported diseases within Europe. Asylum seekers are of increasing importance for infectious disease epidemiology and can be particularly vulnerable for infections and disease progression due to stressful conditions of migration and incomplete vaccination status.
OBJECTIVES: The aim is to analyse transmission of infectious diseases in centralized homes for asylum seekers in national infectious disease surveillance data to identify relevant infectious diseases and possible public health measures to reduce transmission.
METHODS: German national notification data was systematically analysed from 2004 to 2014 for outbreaks reported to have occurred within centralized homes for asylum seekers followed by descriptive analysis of outbreak- and case-characteristics.
RESULTS: From 2004 to 2014 the number of outbreaks in centralized homes for asylum seekers per year increased, a total of 119 outbreaks with 615 cases were reported. Cases in these outbreaks were caused by chicken pox (30 %), measles (20 %), scabies (19 %), rota-virus-gastroenteritis (8 %) and others (each <5 %). Of 119 outbreaks, two outbreaks of measles in centralized homes were connected to outbreaks outside the centralized homes. For 210 of 311 cases in 2014 the place of infection was reported, 87 % of those with known place of infection were infected in Germany.
CONCLUSIONS: Infectious disease outbreaks in centralized homes for asylum seekers are reported increasingly often in Germany. Chicken pox, measles and scabies were the most frequent outbreak causing diseases. Spread of such outbreaks outside centralized homes for asylum seekers was rare and infectious diseases are mainly acquired in Germany. The majority of outbreaks in centralized homes for asylum seekers would be preventable with vaccinations at arrival and appropriate hygiene measures.","['Kühne A', 'Gilsdorf A']",2016,59,5,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,Kühne A and Gilsdorf A.

CONCLUSION: This first Australian population-based study of environmental risk factors confirms that smoking, childhood immunological events and dietary factors play a role in IBD development; while high caffeine intake and pet ownership offer a protective effect.","['Niewiadomski O', 'Studd C', 'Wilson J', 'Williams J', 'Hair C', 'Knight R', 'Prewett E', 'Dabkowski P', 'Alexander S', 'Allen B', 'Dowling D', 'Connell W', 'Desmond P', 'Bell S']",2016,46,6,Intern Med J,"Niewiadomski O, et al.

27032406,Issues in the Treatment of Neurological Conditions Caused by Reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV).,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous neurotropic human herpesvirus. Primary infection usually causes varicella (chicken pox), after which virus becomes latent in ganglia along the entire neuraxis. Decades later, virus reactivates to produce herpes zoster (shingles), a painful dermatomally distributed vesicular eruption. Zoster may be further complicated by postherpetic neuralgia, VZV vasculopathy, myelitis, and segmental motor weakness. VZV reactivation has also been associated with giant cell arteritis. This overview discusses treatment of various conditions that often require both corticosteroids and antiviral drugs. Treatment for VZV-associated disease is often based on case reports and small studies rather than large-scale clinical trials. Issues that require resolution include the optimal duration of such combined therapy, more effective treatment for postherpetic neuralgia, whether some treatments should be given orally or intravenously, the widening spectrum of zoster sine herpete, and the role of antiviral therapy in giant cell arteritis.",['Kennedy PG'],2016,13,3,Neurotherapeutics,Kennedy PG.

27030598,Diversification of the antigen-specific T cell receptor repertoire after varicella zoster vaccination.,"Diversity and size of the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire are two critical determinants for successful control of chronic infection. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) that establishes latency during childhood can escape control mechanisms, in particular with increasing age. We examined the TCR diversity of VZV-reactive CD4 T cells in individuals older than 50 years by studying three identical twin pairs and three unrelated individuals before and after vaccination with live attenuated VZV. Although all individuals had a small number of dominant T cell clones, the breadth of the VZV-specific repertoire differed markedly. A genetic influence was seen for the sharing of individual TCR sequences from antigen-reactive cells but not for repertoire richness or the selection of dominant clones. VZV vaccination favored the expansion of infrequent VZV antigen-reactive TCRs, including those from naïve T cells with lesser boosting of dominant T cell clones. Thus, vaccination does not reinforce the in vivo selection that occurred during chronic infection but leads to a diversification of the VZV-reactive T cell repertoire. However, a single-booster immunization seems insufficient to establish new clonal dominance. Our results suggest that repertoire analysis of antigen-specific TCRs can be an important readout to assess whether a vaccination was able to generate memory cells in clonal sizes that are necessary for immune protection.","['Qi Q', 'Cavanagh MM', 'Le Saux S', 'NamKoong H', 'Kim C', 'Turgano E', 'Liu Y', 'Wang C', 'Mackey S', 'Swan GE', 'Dekker CL', 'Olshen RA', 'Boyd SD', 'Weyand CM', 'Tian L', 'Goronzy JJ']",2016,8,332,Sci Transl Med,"Qi Q, et al.

27027875,Seroprotection to vaccine-preventable diseases among workers at a Victorian tertiary hospital.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine seroprotection for the vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and hepatitis B among new employees seen at a Victorian tertiary hospital staff clinic.
METHODS: Employees who presented to the staff clinic for immunisation assessment between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 were included. Demographic data, self-reported disease history and previous vaccination status were reviewed retrospectively to determine impact on serological results.
RESULTS: A total of 1,901 new employees were included, 83% of whom were at risk of direct contact with blood or body substances. Overall, the proportion of workers seropositive to measles was 88%, mumps 90%, rubella 78%, varicella 93% and hepatitis B 80%. Staff born before 1966 were more likely to have positive measles or mumps serology but negative rubella or hepatitis B serology (p<0.05 for each). Staff who self-reported measles (99% vs. 93%, p=0.03) or varicella infection (98% vs. 92%, p<0.001) were more likely to be seropositive, but those reporting previous vaccination to measles, mumps or rubella were no more likely to be seropositive.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrated levels of seropositivity of 78-93% for the five VPDs. Despite recognised limitations of serological testing, 10-20% of new employees to a healthcare institution lacking seroprotection represents a potentially unacceptable risk of nosocomial transmission of these VPDs. Our findings support ongoing serological testing of new healthcare staff at risk of direct contact with blood or body substances.","['Andrew EC', 'Gibney KB', 'Denholm J', 'Leder K']",2016,40,3,Aust N Z J Public Health,"Andrew EC, et al.

27020058,Immunological evasion of immediate-early varicella zoster virus proteins.,"The varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes the childhood disease commonly known as chickenpox and can later in life reactivate as herpes zoster. The adaptive immune system is known to play an important role in suppressing VZV reactivation. A central aspect of this system is the presentation of VZV-derived peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Here, we investigate if key VZV proteins have evolved their amino acid sequence to avoid presentation by MHC based on predictive models of MHC-peptide affinity. This study shows that the immediate-early proteins of all characterized VZV strains are profoundly depleted for high-affinity MHC-I-restricted epitopes. The same depletion can be found in its closest animal analog, the simian varicella virus. Further orthology analysis towards other herpes viruses suggests that the protein amino acid frequency is one of the primary drivers of targeted epitope depletion.","['Meysman P', 'Fedorov D', 'Van Tendeloo V', 'Ogunjimi B', 'Laukens K']",2016,68,06월 07일,Immunogenetics,"Meysman P, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: To estimate the VE, the proportion of cases vaccinated was compared with the proportion of the population vaccinated using nationwide sentinel surveillance data from 2009-2014 and health insurance claims data covering the period January 2009-March 2014, respectively. A general linear model was used to estimate the OR of vaccination in the cases and the population and the corresponding CIs to observe the stability of the VE estimates over time, and to assess the incremental effectiveness of a second dose.
RESULTS: The overall VE after 1 dose was 86.6% (95% CI: 85.2-87.9), ranging between 94.6% (95% CI: 87.9-97.6) in the first quarter of 2011 and 50.3% (95% CI: 7.3-73.4) in the third quarter of 2013. The overall VE after 2 doses was 97.3% (95% CI: 97.0-97.6), ranging between 99.5% (95% CI: 97.8-99.9) in the second quarter of 2009 and 91.3% (95% CI: 85.7-94.8) in the third quarter of 2013. The incremental VE of 2 doses was 84.6% (95% CI: 81.7-86.9).

26994062,The Epidemiology of Herpes Zoster After Varicella Immunization Under Different Biological Hypotheses: Perspectives From Mathematical Modeling.,"The impact of varicella vaccination on the epidemiology of herpes zoster (HZ) critically depends on the mechanism of immunological boosting, through which reexposures to varicella-zoster virus are thought to reduce the individual risk of HZ development. However, the qualitative and quantitative dynamics of this process are largely unknown. Consequently, mathematical models evaluating immunization strategies need to rely on theoretical assumptions. Available varicella-zoster virus models can be classified in 3 main families according to the postulated effect of exogenous boosting: 1) progressive accumulation of immunity following repeated reexposures; 2) partial protection that wanes over time; or 3) full but temporary immunity against HZ. In this work, we review and compare quantitative predictions from the 3 modeling approaches regarding the effect of varicella immunization on HZ. All models predict a qualitatively similar, but quantitatively heterogeneous, transient increase of HZ incidence. In particular, novel estimates from the progressive immunity model predict the largest increase in natural HZ and the largest incidence of HZ cases from reactivation of the vaccine strain, which in the long term will likely outnumber prevaccination numbers. Our results reinforce the idea that a better understanding of HZ pathogenesis is required before further mass varicella immunization programs are set out.","['Guzzetta G', 'Poletti P', 'Merler S', 'Manfredi P']",2016,183,8,Am J Epidemiol,"Guzzetta G, et al.

26985417,Modified measles versus rubella versus atypical measles: One and same thing.,"INTRODUCTION: In outbreak settings, more than one virus may be infecting the given population. In twin or triple outbreak of measles, German measles (rubella), and varicella in highly immunized hilly areas, maximal number of the case patients in all the hilly villages belonged to the older age group. It suggested an obvious shift to the higher age group, warranting second dose opportunity in such case scenario. The clinical presentations of viral diseases are too similar to differentiate. The aim is to clearly categorize the case patients of modified measles, rubella, and atypical measles in outbreak settings.
RESULTS: Four outbreaks are listed. In the first one, sixty case patients were identified from 1026 people in 5 villages. Of these, 41 were diagnosed by clinically, 8 were laboratory confirmed as measles and 11 were epidemiologically linked German measles case patients. Seventy percent of the cases were vaccinated for measles. In second case, we identified 29/35 measles and 6/35 were confirmed as epidemiologically linked unvaccinated chickenpox case patients. In third one, we identified 116 cases in eight villages (112/116 clinically and 04/116 laboratory confirmed). Majority of cases were immunized against measles, but only minor cases for rubella. In fourth case, we identified 505 case patients from mixed outbreaks of varicella, measles and rubella (30/505 clinically, 467/505 epidemiologically linked and 8/505 laboratory confirmed case patients from a study population of 3280). In all the four outbreaks, prima facie, the clinical presentations of both rubella and modified measles were difficult to differentiate.
DISCUSSION: On the basis of outbreak investigation and analytical inference, it has been observed that the symtomatology of modified measles and laboratory confirmed rubella case patients/epidemiologically linked cases are so similar placed that many a time, it becomes much difficult to line list the cases in one section of modified measles or rubella or atypical cases.
CONCLUSION: Similarities of morphological symptoms between modified measles and rubella is the point of challenge and it causes debate between pediatrician and field epidemiologist to differentiate and classify them.","['Gupta SN', 'Gupta N', 'Gupta S']",2015,4,4,J Family Med Prim Care,"Gupta SN, et al.

26979822,Negative attitude and low intention to vaccinate universally against varicella among public health professionals and parents in the Netherlands: two internet surveys.,"BACKGROUND: Prior to introduction of universal varicella vaccination, it is crucial to gain insight into the willingness to vaccinate among the population. This is because suboptimal national vaccination coverage might increase the age of infection in children, which will lead to higher complication rates. We studied the attitude and intention to vaccinate against varicella among Dutch public health professionals who execute the National Immunisation Programme (NIP), and parents.
METHODS: Medical doctors and nurses of regional public health services (RPHS) and child health clinics (CHC), and a random sample of parents received an internet survey on varicella vaccination. Separate logistic regression models were used to identify determinants for a positive attitude (professionals) or a positive intention (parents) to vaccinate against varicella within the NIP (free of charge).
RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 181 RPHS professionals (67%), 260 CHC professionals (46%), and 491 parents (33%). Of professionals, 21% had a positive attitude towards universal varicella vaccination, while 72% preferred to limit vaccination to high-risk groups only. Of parents, 28% had a positive intention to vaccinate their child against varicella within the NIP. The strongest determinant for a positive attitude or intention to vaccinate against varicella among professionals and parents was the belief that varicella is a disease serious enough to vaccinate against.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that a majority of the Dutch public health professionals and parents in this study have a negative attitude or low intention to vaccinate universally against varicella, as a result of the perceived low severity of the disease. Most participating professionals support selective vaccination to prevent varicella among high-risk groups.","['van Lier A', 'Tostmann A', 'Harmsen IA', 'de Melker HE', 'Hautvast JL', 'Ruijs WL']",2016,16,,BMC Infect Dis,"van Lier A, et al.

One-dose varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) was examined in those aged 1 to 18 years.
METHODS: From May 2009 through June 2011, varicella cases identified during active surveillance in Antelope Valley, CA and Philadelphia, PA were enrolled into a matched case-control study. Matched controls within 2 years of the patient's age were selected from immunization registries. A standardized questionnaire was administered to participants' parents, and varicella vaccination history was obtained from health care provider, immunization registry, or parent records. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate varicella VE against clinically diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed varicella.
RESULTS: A total of 125 clinically diagnosed varicella cases and 408 matched controls were enrolled. Twenty-nine cases were laboratory confirmed. One-dose VE (1-dose versus unvaccinated) was 75.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.7%-90.3%) in preventing any clinically diagnosed varicella and 78.1% (95% CI, 12.7%-94.5%) against moderate or severe, clinically diagnosed disease (≥50 lesions). Among subjects aged ≥4 years, 2-dose VE (2-dose versus unvaccinated) was 93.6% (95% CI, 75.6%-98.3%) against any varicella and 97.9% (95% CI, 83.0%-99.7%) against moderate or severe varicella. Incremental effectiveness (2-dose versus 1-dose) was 87.5% against clinically diagnosed varicella and 97.3% against laboratory-confirmed varicella.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-dose varicella vaccination offered better protection against varicella from community transmission among school-aged children compared with 1-dose vaccination.","['Perella D', 'Wang C', 'Civen R', 'Viner K', 'Kuguru K', 'Daskalaki I', 'Schmid DS', 'Lopez AS', 'Tseng HF', 'Newbern EC', 'Mascola L', 'Bialek SR']",2016,137,4,Pediatrics,"Perella D, et al.

The Glioma International Case-Control Study (GICC) is a large, multisite consortium with data on 4533 cases and 4171 controls collected across five countries. Here, we utilized the GICC data to confirm the previously reported associations between history of chickenpox and glioma risk in one of the largest studies to date on this topic. Using two-stage random-effects restricted maximum likelihood modeling, we found that a positive history of chickenpox was associated with a 21% lower glioma risk, adjusting for age and sex (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.65-0.96). Furthermore, the protective effect of chickenpox was stronger for high-grade gliomas.

26970699,Chicken pox infection in patients undergoing chemotherapy: A retrospective analysis from a tertiary care center in India.,"There is paucity of data on the incidence, severity and management of chicken pox in patients receiving active chemotherapy for cancer. From October 2010 to October 2011, patients were included in this study if they developed a chicken pox infection during their chemotherapy. The details of patients' cancer diagnosis and treatment along with clinical and epidemiological data of the chicken pox infections were assessed from a prospectively maintained database. Twenty-four patients had a chicken pox infection while receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The median age of the patients was 21 years, and two-thirds of the patients had solid tumor malignancies. Overall, eight (33%) patients had complications, six (25%) patients had febrile neutropenia, four (17%) had diarrhea/mucositis, and four (17%) had pneumonia. The median time for recovery of the infection and complications in the patients was 9.5 days (5-29 days), whereas for neutropenic patients, it was 6.5 days (3-14 days). The median time for recovery from chicken pox infections in neutropenic patients was 10 days (5-21 days), compared with 8.5 days (0-29 days) in non-neutropenic patients (P=0.84). The median time for recovery from infections was 8.5 days in patients with comorbidities (N=4), which was the same for patients with no comorbidities. The clinical presentation and complication rates of chicken pox in cancer patients, who were on active chemotherapy, are similar to the normal population. The recovery from a varicella infection and complications may be delayed in patients with neutropenia. The varicella infection causes a therapy delay in 70% of patients. Aggressive antiviral therapy, supportive care and isolation of the index cases remain the backbone of treatment.","['Noronha V', 'Ostwal V', 'Ramaswamy A', 'Joshi A', 'Nair R', 'Banavali SD', 'Prabhash K']",2017,10,1,J Infect Public Health,"Noronha V, et al.

METHODS: Varicella-associated mortality data were evaluated between 1996 and 2011 and varicella zoster virus-associated hospitalizations between 1998 and 2013. Data were gathered from the Informatics Department of the Unified Health System, considering the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code B01. All age groups were assessed. Varicella-specific mortality rates were calculated and seasonality of varicella-zoster virus-associated hospitalizations was described.
RESULTS: There were 2334 varicella deaths between 1996 and 2011, 19.3% in infants aged less than 1 year and 36% in children from 1 to 4 years. In infants under 1 year, varicella mortality rates reached 3.2/100,000/year. In children aged 1-4 years, varicella mortality rates reach 1.64/100,000/year. Average annual mortality rates for varicella in Brazil are 0.88/100,000 in infants under 1 year and 0.40/100,000 in children aged 1-4 years. The total number of hospitalizations associated with varicella zoster virus was 62,246 from 2008 to 2013. Varicella-associated hospitalizations have a seasonal distribution in children, peaking in November. In the elderly, monthly averages of herpes zoster-associated hospitalizations present no significant seasonal variation.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella is associated, in the pre-vaccine period, to significant morbidity and mortality in Brazil. The universal vaccination program is expected to decrease the disease burden from varicella.","['de Martino Mota A', 'Carvalho-Costa FA']",2016,92,4,J Pediatr (Rio J),de Martino Mota A and Carvalho-Costa FA.

26965075,The impact of varicella vaccination on varicella-related hospitalization rates: global data review.,"OBJECTIVE: to describe the impact of varicella vaccination on varicella-related hospitalization rates in countries that implemented universal vaccination against the disease.
DATA SOURCE: we identified countries that implemented universal vaccination against varicella at the http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/schedules site of the World Health Organization and selected articles in Pubmed describing the changes (pre/post-vaccination) in the varicella-related hospitalization rates in these countries, using the Keywords ""varicella"", ""vaccination/vaccine"" and ""children"" (or) ""hospitalization"". Publications in English published between January 1995 and May 2015 were included.
DATA SYNTHESIS: 24 countries with universal vaccination against varicella and 28 articles describing the impact of the vaccine on varicella-associated hospitalizations rates in seven countries were identified. The US had 81.4% -99.2% reduction in hospitalization rates in children younger than four years after 6-14 years after the onset of universal vaccination (1995), with vaccination coverage of 90%; Uruguay: 94% decrease (children aged 1-4 years) in six years, vaccination coverage of 90%; Canada: 93% decrease (age 1-4 years) in 10 years, coverage of 93%; Germany: 62.4% decrease (age 1-4 years) in 8 years, coverage of 78.2%; Australia: 76.8% decrease (age 1-4 years) in 5 years, coverage of 90%; Spain: 83.5% decrease (age <5 years) in four years, coverage of 77.2% and Italy 69.7% -73.8% decrease (general population), coverage of 60%-95%.
CONCLUSIONS: The publications showed variations in the percentage of decrease in varicella-related hospitalization rates after universal vaccination in the assessed countries; the results probably depend on the time since the implementation of universal vaccination, differences in the studied age group, hospital admission criteria, vaccination coverage and strategy, which does not allow direct comparison between data.","['Hirose M', 'Gilio AE', 'Ferronato AE', 'Ragazzi SL']",2016,34,3,Rev Paul Pediatr,"Hirose M, et al.

26937872,Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster, also known as 'shingles', is a neurocutaneous disease characterised by the reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox when immunity to VZV declines. It is an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and it can significantly compromise the quality of life of affected individuals. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity and this predisposes older people to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of VZV activates specific T cell production avoiding viral reactivation. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a herpes zoster vaccine with an attenuated active virus for clinical use among older adults, which has been tested in large populations. A new adjuvanted recombinant VZV subunit zoster vaccine has also been tested. It consists of recombinant VZV glycoprotein E and a liposome-based AS01B adjuvant system. This new vaccine is not yet available for clinical use.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.
SEARCH METHODS: For this 2015 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1948 to the 3rd week of October 2015), EMBASE (2010 to October 2015), CINAHL (1981 to October 2015) and LILACS (1982 to October 2015).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine with placebo or no vaccine, to prevent herpes zoster in older adults (mean age > 60 years).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently collected and analysed data using a data extraction form. They also performed 'Risk of bias' assessment.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 13 studies involving 69,916 participants. The largest study included 38,546 participants. All studies were conducted in high-income countries and included only healthy Caucasian individuals ≥ 60 years of age without immunosuppressive comorbidities. Ten studies used live attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccines. Three studies tested a new type of vaccine not yet available for clinical use. We judged five of the included studies to be at low risk of bias.The incidence of herpes zoster, at up to three years of follow-up, was lower in participants who received the vaccine than in those who received a placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56, risk difference (RD) 2%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50; GRADE: moderate quality evidence. The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of mild to moderate intensity adverse events. These date came from one large study that included 38,546 people aged 60 years or older.A study including 8122 participants compared the new vaccine (not yet available) to the placebo; the group that received the new vaccine had a lower incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years of follow-up: RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.10, RD 3%, NNTB 33; GRADE: moderate quality evidence. The vaccinated group had a higher incidence of adverse events but most them were of mild to moderate intensity.All studies received funding from the pharmaceutical industry.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease and this protection can last three years. In general, zoster vaccine is well tolerated; it produces few systemic adverse events and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity.There are studies of a new vaccine (with a VZV glycoproteic fraction plus adjuvant), which is currently not yet available for clinical use.","['Gagliardi AM', 'Andriolo BN', 'Torloni MR', 'Soares BG']",2016,3,3,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Gagliardi AM, et al.

26922172,Vaccines in Multiple Sclerosis.,"Vaccinations help prevent communicable disease. To be valuable, a vaccine's ability to prevent disease must exceed the risk of adverse effects from administration. Many vaccines present no risk of infection as they are comprised of killed or non-infectious components while other vaccines consist of live attenuated microorganisms which carry a potential risk of infection-particularly, in patients with compromised immunity. There are several unique considerations with respect to vaccination in the multiple sclerosis (MS) population. First, there has been concern that vaccination may trigger or aggravate the disease. Second, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) employed in the treatment of MS may increase the risk of infectious complications from vaccines or alter their efficacy. Lastly, in some cases, vaccination strategies may be part of the treatment paradigm in attempts to avoid complications of therapy.","['Williamson EM', 'Chahin S', 'Berger JR']",2016,16,4,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,"Williamson EM, et al.

26918131,Varicella Zoster Virus in the Nervous System.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous, exclusively human alphaherpesvirus. Primary infection usually results in varicella (chickenpox), after which VZV becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. As VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity declines in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, VZV reactivates and causes herpes zoster (shingles), frequently complicated by postherpetic neuralgia. VZV reactivation also produces multiple serious neurological and ocular diseases, such as cranial nerve palsies, meningoencephalitis, myelopathy, and VZV vasculopathy, including giant cell arteritis, with or without associated rash. Herein, we review the clinical, laboratory, imaging, and pathological features of neurological complications of VZV reactivation as well as diagnostic tests to verify VZV infection of the nervous system. Updates on the physical state of VZV DNA and viral gene expression in latently infected ganglia, neuronal, and primate models to study varicella pathogenesis and immunity are presented along with innovations in the immunization of elderly individuals to prevent VZV reactivation.","['Gilden D', 'Nagel M', 'Cohrs R', 'Mahalingam R', 'Baird N']",2015,4,,F1000Res,"Gilden D, et al.

26901584,[Decisional framework for varicella vaccine: challenges in the face of opportunity].,"INTRODUCTION: Decision makers adopt interventions, including vaccines, which are most beneficial to populations. A transparent, unbiased, and comprehensive framework based on evidence-based criteria is a promising tool to guide decision-making on vaccine adoption: we developed a multi-dimensional framework conceived from the DECIDE - Evidence to decision Framework (EtD framework). We validated the framework by conducting a real data and evidence set collection on varicella vaccination and tested it with a multidisciplinary group.
METHODS: The EtD framework presented evidence concerning the varicella vaccination organized in six dimensions: Burden of disease, Vaccine characteristics and impact of immunization program, Values and preferences, Resource use, Equity and Feasibility. Two reviewers completed each dimension with information about varicella vaccine. A multidisciplinary group of 42 participants were asked to evaluate the information in the framework, decide whether to introduce varicella vaccine in the national immunization program, assess the usefulness, and propose some impovements of the decision-making tool.
RESULTS: From 33 responders (79%) out of 42, 61% supported the adoption of the varicella vaccine as part of the national immunization program. A half (50%) favored the monovalent vaccine while the other half chose the tetravalent vaccine. About 90% of responders found information in the EtD framework comprehensive, easy to understand, and presented in a way that helped make decisions.
CONCLUSIONS: Complete and transparent information are welcome. The EtD identified a situation of important divergences between policy makers regarding the introduction and the choice of vaccine. In our case study, for example, a third of the multidisciplinary group did not recommend the adoption of varicella vaccine.","['González-Lorenzo M', 'Tirani M', 'Piatti A', 'Coppola L', 'Gramegna M', 'Ruggiero F', 'Auxilia F', 'Moja L']",2016,107,2,Recenti Prog Med,"González-Lorenzo M, et al.

26895838,Factors influencing completion of multi-dose vaccine schedules in adolescents: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Completion of multiple dose vaccine schedules is crucial to ensure a protective immune response, and maximise vaccine cost-effectiveness. While barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake have recently been reviewed, there is no comprehensive review of factors influencing subsequent adherence or completion, which is key to achieving vaccine effectiveness. This study identifies and summarises the literature on factors affecting completion of multi-dose vaccine schedules by adolescents.
METHODS: Ten online databases and four websites were searched (February 2014). Studies with analysis of factors predicting completion of multi-dose vaccines were included. Study participants within 9-19 years of age were included in the review. The defined outcome was completion of the vaccine series within 1 year among those who received the first dose.
RESULTS: Overall, 6159 abstracts were screened, and 502 full texts were reviewed. Sixty one studies were eligible for this review. All except two were set in high-income countries. Included studies evaluated human papillomavirus vaccine, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and varicella vaccines. Reported vaccine completion rates, among those who initiated vaccination, ranged from 27% to over 90%. Minority racial or ethnic groups and inadequate health insurance coverage were risk factors for low completion, irrespective of initiation rates. Parental healthcare seeking behaviour was positively associated with completion. Vaccine delivery in schools was associated with higher completion than delivery in the community or health facilities. Gender, prior healthcare use and socio-economic status rarely remained significant risks or protective factors in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost all studies investigating factors affecting completion have been carried out in developed countries and investigate a limited range of variables. Increased understanding of barriers to completion in adolescents will be invaluable to future new vaccine introductions and the further development of an adolescent health platform.

VZV survives host defenses, even with an intact immune system, and disseminates in the host before causing disease. To date, several diverse immunomodulatory strategies used by VZV to undermine host immunity have been identified; however, few studies have addressed the complement evasion strategies used by this virus. Here, we show that expression of CD59, which is a key member of host regulators of complement activation (RCA), is significantly upregulated in response to VZV infection in human T cells and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) but not in human skin xenografts in SCID-hu mice in vivo. This is the first report demonstrating that VZV infection upregulates host CD59 expression in a tissue-specific manner in vivo, which may aid VZV in complement evasion and pathogenesis.","['Wang W', 'Wang X', 'Yang L', 'Fu W', 'Pan D', 'Liu J', 'Ye J', 'Zhao Q', 'Zhu H', 'Cheng T', 'Xia N']",2016,491,,Virology,"Wang W, et al.

Gastric lesions are usually preceded by typical papulovesicular skin lesions. When gastric involvement is the first symptom of the disease its diagnosis and management may be delayed, which may entail severe consequences for immunocompromised patients. It is therefore that we suggest its inclusion in the algorithm for immunocompromised patients with abdominal pain and ulcer-like endoscopic lesions.","['Sastre Lozano VM', 'Martínez García P', 'Sánchez Sánchez C', 'Torregrosa Lloret M', 'Sevilla Cáceres L', 'Romero Cara P', 'Morán Sánchez S']",2016,108,10,Rev Esp Enferm Dig,"Sastre Lozano VM, et al.

26882171,Comprehensive epidemiological and genotype-phenotype analyses in a large European sample with idiopathic achalasia.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although an eight-residue insertion in HLA-DQβ1 has been recently identified as a genetic risk factor for idiopathic achalasia, other risk factors are still unknown. In the present study, we carried out an epidemiological survey and a genotype-phenotype (G×P) analysis to gain further insights into the etiology of achalasia.
METHODS: We obtained medical data from 696 achalasia patients and 410 controls, as well as their first-degree relatives (2543 of patients and 1497 of controls). For the G×P analysis, we stratified the patients into HLA-DQβ1 insertion carriers and noncarriers.
RESULTS: Our data show that patients are more often affected by viral infections before achalasia onset (P<0.0001, most significantly for varicella zoster virus infections). In addition, allergic (P=0.0005) and autoimmune disorders (P=0.0007, most significantly for psoriasis and Sjögren's syndrome) represent comorbid disease conditions. First-degree relatives of patients also show higher prevalence rates of allergic disorders (P=0.0007) and psoriasis (P=0.016) compared with control relatives. Moreover, the G×P analysis reveals that achalasia is triggered by pregnancies in female HLA-DQβ1 insertion carriers (P=0.031).
CONCLUSION: Our data point to a role of viral infections in the development of achalasia. In addition, they provide evidence for a relationship between achalasia and allergic, as well as autoimmune, disorders. Furthermore, pregnancy seems to be a disease-triggering factor in female HLA-DQβ1 insertion carriers, which points to hormonal and/or immunosuppressive factors influencing disease development.","['Becker J', 'Niebisch S', 'Ricchiuto A', 'Schaich EJ', 'Lehmann G', 'Waltgenbach T', 'Schafft A', 'Hess T', 'Lenze F', 'Venerito M', 'Hüneburg R', 'Lingohr P', 'Matthaei H', 'Seewald S', 'Scheuermann U', 'Kreuser N', 'Veits L', 'Wouters MM', 'Gockel HR', 'Lang H', 'Vieth M', 'Müller M', 'Eckardt AJ', 'von Rahden BH', 'Knapp M', 'Boeckxstaens GE', 'Fimmers R', 'Nöthen MM', 'Schulz HG', 'Gockel I', 'Schumacher J']",2016,28,6,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Becker J, et al.

Vaccination is by far the most effective way to prevent these diseases. More safe, stable and efficient vaccines, such as epitope-based vaccines, now have been increasingly investigated by many researchers. However, only a few VZV neutralizing epitopes have been identified to date. We have previously identified a linear epitope between amino acid residues 121 and 135 of gE. In this study, we validated that this epitope is highly conserved amongst different VZV strains that covered five existing phylogenetic clades with an identity of 100%. We evaluated the immunogenicity of the recombinant hepatitis B virus core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLPs) which included amino acids (121-135). VZV-gE-specific antibodies were detected in immunized mouse serum using ELISA. The anti-peptide antiserum positively detected VZV via Western blot and immunofluorescent staining assays. More importantly, these peptides could neutralize VZV, indicating that these peptides represented neutralizing epitopes. These findings have important implications for the development of epitope-based protective VZV vaccines.","['Zhu R', 'Liu J', 'Chen C', 'Ye X', 'Xu L', 'Wang W', 'Zhao Q', 'Zhu H', 'Cheng T', 'Xia N']",2016,34,13,Vaccine,"Zhu R, et al.

26870141,Enzymatic Digestion Pattern of Varicella Zoster Virus ORF38 and ORF54 in Chickenpox Patients Using RFLP Technique.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox in children and zoster (zona) in the elderly. Using RFLP-PCR method for detection of VZV specific SNPs ORF38, 54 and 62 could distinguish the profile of VZV isolates. The aim of this study was to investigate enzymatic digestion pattern of VZV ORF38 and ORF54 in chickenpox patients using RFLP technique.
METHODS: Thirty-eight chickenpox patients, who referred to the hospitals of Iran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran from May 2010 to June 2015 were enrolled in this cross sectional study. After the DNA extraction, PCR amplification of 38 VZV isolates performed by specific primers of ORFs 38 and 54, then RFLP assay and digestion carried out by PstI (for ORF38) and BglI (for ORF54) restriction enzymes.
RESULTS: Of 38 positive VZV DNA, the mean age (yr)±SD was 34.4±23.3 (range: 7-89). 22 (57.9%) were female and 16 (42.1%) were male. The predominant VZV profile of BglI(+) PstI(+) were 89.5% (34/38) followed by 10.5% (4/38) PstI(+) BglI‾. Statistical analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between genotype, age, sex, and year of infection variables (P value> 0.05). The common VZV genotype among Iranian patients with chickenpox and zona infection is genotype BglI(+) PstI(+) followed by PstI(+) BglI‾.
CONCLUSION: There are different VZV circulating genotypes that call for for more research on this field by widely population and other methods such as nucleotide sequencing to justify the accurate VZV genotype prevalence in Iran.","['Safarnezhad Tameshkel F', 'Karbalaie Niya MH', 'Keyvani H']",2016,11,1,Iran J Pathol,"Safarnezhad Tameshkel F, et al.

26868082,Parental report of vaccine receipt in children with autism spectrum disorder: Do rates differ by pattern of ASD onset?,"A contentious theory espoused by some parents is that regressive-onset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is triggered by vaccines. If this were true, then vaccine receipt should be higher in children with regressive-onset ASD compared with other patterns of onset. Parental report of rate of receipt for six vaccines (DPT/DTaP, HepB, Hib, polio, MMR, varicella) was examined in children with ASD (N=2755) who were categorized by pattern of ASD onset (early onset, plateau, delay-plus-regression, regression). All pairwise comparisons were significantly equivalent within a 10% margin for all vaccines except varicella, for which the delay-plus-regression group had lower rates of receipt (81%) than the early-onset (87%) and regression (87%) groups. Findings do not support a connection between regressive-onset ASD and vaccines in this cohort.","['Goin-Kochel RP', 'Mire SS', 'Dempsey AG', 'Fein RH', 'Guffey D', 'Minard CG', 'Cunningham RM', 'Sahni LC', 'Boom JA']",2016,34,11,Vaccine,"Goin-Kochel RP, et al.

26860417,[Seroprevalence of varicella-zoster virus antibodies after the recent introduction of the universal childhood immunisation schedule in the Community of Madrid].,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In November 2006, the Community of Madrid included the chickenpox vaccine into the immunisation schedule for children from 15 months of age. This was withdrawn in January 2014. Seroprevalence of antibodies to the virus is estimated after the first 2-3 years from the inclusion of the vaccine, and as well as its evolution since 1999.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted on the target population consisting of residents in the Community of Madrid between 2 and 60 years of age. Measurement of IgG antibodies was performed using an ELISA technique. Seroprevalence was estimated according to sociodemographic characteristics using multiple logistic regressions. The results are compared with previous surveys. Also, the seroprevalence and geometric mean of the antibody according immunisation status and history of the disease are presented. The confidence level used is 95%.
RESULTS: A total of 4,378 subjects were included, with a response rate of 69%. The estimated seroprevalence was 95.3% (95% CI: 94.6% - 95.9%). Over 90% of children from the age of 10 have antibodies. The seroprevalence was higher in people with less education. The seroprevalence of immunity vaccine exceeds 90% in the first year after vaccination, but in the second year decreased to 82.6% (95% CI 56.0 - 94.7). Significant differences, attributable to universal vaccination, were found compared to previous surveys.
DISCUSSION: Continued surveillance is needed in order to assess the impact of the withdrawal of the recommendation to vaccinate at 15 months.","['García-Comas L', 'Ordobás Gavín M', 'Sanz Moreno JC', 'Ramos Blázquez B', 'Gutiérrez Rodríguez MA', 'Barranco Ordóñez D']",2016,34,10,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,"García-Comas L, et al.

Children after intestinal transplantation carry a high risk of infection due to increased immunosuppression. In a series of 22 children after intestinal transplantation, we studied the vaccination schedules and the antibodies against vaccine-preventable diseases before transplantation, and at one and five yr after transplantation. We reviewed whether the vaccination schedules were complete, and we analysed the factors that may influence serological immunity and the incidence of disease in patients with deficient immunity. All patients completed the recommended vaccination schedules for DTaP-IPV and HBV. After transplantation, the negative antibodies against vaccine-preventable diseases were mostly related to an antirejection therapy: for DTaP-IPV: four of four patients with no antibody had been treated for rejection, for HBV: two of five, HAV: three of four, MMR: three of seven, and VZV: three of four. A post-transplantation varicella infection was followed by acute rejection, with probability for a relationship between both events. We observed 50% of varicella cases in unvaccinated children, highlighting the importance of pretransplant vaccination. Waning immunogenicity mediated by antibodies against vaccine-preventable disease after transplantation indicated a need for boosters. The recommendations should be regularly enforced, as the reliance on routine immunizations schedules is not adequate in immunocompromised patients.","['Demir Z', 'Frange P', 'Lacaille F']",2016,20,3,Pediatr Transplant,"Demir Z, et al.

26837602,Economic evaluation of pediatric influenza immunization program compared with other pediatric immunization programs: A systematic review.,"This study compared the economic value of pediatric immunisation programmes for influenza to those for rotavirus (RV), meningococcal disease (MD), pneumococcal disease (PD), human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B (Hep B), and varicella reported in recent (2000 onwards) cost-effectiveness (CE) studies identified in a systematic review of PubMed, health technology, and vaccination databases. The systematic review yielded 51 economic evaluation studies of pediatric immunisation - 10 (20%) for influenza and 41 (80%) for the other selected diseases. The quality of the eligible articles was assessed using Drummond's checklist. Although inherent challenges and limitations exist when comparing economic evaluations of immunisation programmes, an overall comparison of the included studies demonstrated cost-effectiveness/cost saving for influenza from a European-Union-Five (EU5) and United States (US) perspective; point estimates for cost/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) from dominance (cost-saving with more effect) to ≤45,444 were reported. The economic value of influenza programmes was comparable to the other vaccines of interest, with cost/QALY in general considerably lower than RV, Hep B, MD and PD. Independent of the perspective and type of analysis, the economic impact of a pediatric influenza immunisation program was influenced by vaccine efficacy, immunisation coverage, costs, and most significantly by herd immunity. This review suggests that pediatric influenza immunisation may offer a cost effective strategy when compared with HPV and varicella and possibly more value compared with other childhood vaccines (RV, Hep B, MD and PD).","['Gibson E', 'Begum N', 'Sigmundsson B', 'Sackeyfio A', 'Hackett J', 'Rajaram S']",2016,12,5,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Gibson E, et al.

26835890,Current and future effects of varicella and herpes zoster vaccination in Germany - Insights from a mathematical model in a country with universal varicella vaccination.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is primarily known for causing varicella in childhood, but can reactivate again as herpes zoster (HZ) after a period of latency, mainly in persons older than 50 years. Universal varicella vaccination was introduced in Germany in 2004, while HZ vaccination has not been recommended yet. We aimed to quantify the potential long-term effects of universal childhood varicella vaccination and HZ vaccination of the elderly on varicella and HZ incidence in Germany over a time horizon of 100 years, using a transmission model calibrated to pre-vaccination data and validated against early post-vaccination data. Using current vaccination coverage rates of 87% (64%) with one (two) varicella vaccine dose(s), the model predicts a decrease in varicella cases by 89% for the year 2015. In the long run, the incidence reduction will stabilize at about 70%. Under the assumption of the boosting hypothesis of improved HZ protection caused by exposure to VZV, the model predicts a temporary increase in HZ incidence of up to 20% for around 50 years. HZ vaccination of the elderly with an assumed coverage of 20% has only limited effects in counteracting this temporary increase in HZ incidence. However, HZ incidence is shown to decrease in the long-term by 58% as vaccinated individuals get older and finally reach age-classes with originally high HZ incidence. Despite substantial uncertainties around several key variables, the model's results provide valuable insights that support decision-making regarding national VZV vaccination strategies.","['Horn J', 'Karch A', 'Damm O', 'Kretzschmar ME', 'Siedler A', 'Ultsch B', 'Weidemann F', 'Wichmann O', 'Hengel H', 'Greiner W', 'Mikolajczyk RT']",2016,12,7,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Horn J, et al.

26826886,Hospitalization for Varicella and Zoster in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and varicella- and herpes zoster-related pediatric hospitalizations.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional inpatient study using the triennial Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database for years 1997-2012 to evaluate the association between a secondary diagnosis of IBD and a primary diagnosis of varicella or herpes zoster for hospitalized children ages 5-20 years. Billing codes were used to identify varicella, herpes zoster, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and other immunocompromising conditions. A logistic regression model was fitted to quantify the odds of varicella or zoster between these categories.
RESULTS: There were 8 828 712 weighted admissions meeting the study criteria, 4434 with varicella and 4488 with herpes zoster. There was an association of IBD and immunocompromising conditions with hospitalization for varicella and herpes zoster. This association was stronger among children with Crohn's disease (varicella OR, 12.75; 95% CI, 8.30-19.59; zoster OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 5.60-11.18) compared with children with ulcerative colitis (varicella OR 4.25; 95% CI 1.98-9.12, zoster OR 3.90; 95% CI 1.98-7.67).
CONCLUSIONS: IBD in children is associated with hospitalizations for varicella and herpes zoster. These results highlight the importance of efforts to vaccinate patients with IBD without varicella immunity, ideally before the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, research is needed on the safety and efficacy of the varicella vaccine in children with IBD on immunomodulators or biologic therapy.","['Adams DJ', 'Nylund CM']",2016,171,,J Pediatr,Adams DJ and Nylund CM.

26780112,Varicella vaccination in pediatric oncology patients without interruption of chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality from primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is increased in immunocompromised children. Vaccination of VZV-seronegative cancer patients with live-attenuated varicella vaccine is safe when chemotherapy is interrupted. However, VZV vaccination without interruption of chemotherapy would be preferable.
OBJECTIVE: To vaccinate VZV-seronegative pediatric oncology patients with live-attenuated VZV vaccine without interrupting their chemotherapy.
STUDY-DESIGN: We performed a single-center prospective cohort study.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with either a hematological malignancy (n=24) or a solid tumor (n=7) were vaccinated early during their course of chemotherapy. VZV IgG seroconversion occurred in 14 of the 31 patients (45%) after one vaccination. Only 20 patients were revaccinated after 3 months. These were patients who did not seroconvert (5 patients) and patients who serocoverted (15 patients) to induce or sustain seropositivity. Of these 20 patients the final seroconversion rate was 70%. Seven out of the 31 patients (23%) developed a mild rash of which 5 were treated with antivirals and recovered completely without interrupting chemotherapy, and 2 recovered untreated. Of these 31 immunized patients 26 were available for cellular testing. After one vaccination 20 of 26 patients (77%) tested positive for VZV-specific CD4(+) T cells, of which 7 patients had remained VZV-seronegative. After the second vaccination 11 of 11 patients showed VZV-specific CD4(+) T cells to sustain positivity, although 4 remained VZV-seronegative.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that live-attenuated VZV vaccine can be safely administered to closely monitored pediatric oncology patients without interruption of chemotherapy and adaptive immunity was induced despite incomplete seroconversion.","['van de Wetering MD', 'Vossen MT', 'Jansen MH', 'Caron HN', 'Kuijpers TW']",2016,75,,J Clin Virol,"van de Wetering MD, et al.

26762528,"Varicella vaccine without human serum albumin versus licensed varicella vaccine in children during the second year of life: a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial.","BACKGROUND: GSK's varicella vaccine contains human serum albumin (HSA) which is used to stabilize the virus and prevent immunogens from adhering to the injection vial walls. However, because HSA is derived from human blood, there is a theoretical risk that it might contain infectious agents which could be unsafe for humans. Given this concern, a study was undertaken to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a new formulation without HSA with the currently licensed varicella vaccine in the Czech Republic and Hungary.
METHODS: Healthy children aged 11-21 months received two doses of the varicella vaccine either with or without HSA. Antibody titres against varicella-zoster virus (anti-VZV) were measured 42 days after each dose, using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA, cut-off = 4dilution(-1)) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, cut-off = 25 mIU/ml). Solicited local symptoms were recorded during a 4-day post-vaccination follow-up period; solicited general and unsolicited symptoms were recorded during a 43-day post-vaccination follow-up period and serious adverse event (SAEs) were recorded throughout the study.
RESULTS: Of 244 children (mean age = 15.2 months [SD = 3.2]) vaccinated in the study, 233 (vaccine without HSA N = 117; vaccine containing HSA N = 116) formed the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort. Observed seroconversion/seroresponse rates were >98 and 100 %, 42 days after doses 1 and 2, respectively. The rates were within the same range in both groups, irrespective of the testing assay. The varicella vaccine without HSA was non-inferior to the licensed vaccine in terms of anti-VZV antibody Geometric Mean Titre/Concentration ratio (1.12 [95 % CI:0.86-1.46] by IFA; 1.12 [95 % CI:0.93-1.33] by ELISA) approximately six weeks after the first dose of the 2-dose vaccination course. The incidence of solicited and unsolicited symptoms was similar after both vaccines; low-grade fever was numerically higher after the first dose of the varicella vaccine without HSA. Seven SAEs were reported, none of which were fatal or considered to be vaccine-related.
CONCLUSIONS: The first dose of a new varicella vaccine without HSA was immunologically non-inferior to the licensed varicella vaccine. After two doses, both vaccines had acceptable safety profiles in children aged 11-21 months in the Czech Republic and Hungary.

26750127,Developments in Varicella Zoster Virus Vasculopathy.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a highly neurotropic human herpesvirus. Primary infection usually causes varicella (chicken pox), after which virus becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. VZV reactivation results in zoster (shingles) which is frequently complicated by chronic pain (postherpetic neuralgia). VZV reactivation also causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis, ocular disorders, and vasculopathy, all of which can occur in the absence of rash. This review focuses on the association of VZV and stroke, and on the widening spectrum of disorders produced by VZV vasculopathy in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, including recipients of varicella vaccine. Aside from ischemic stroke, VZV infection of cerebral arteries may lead to development of intracerebral aneurysms, with or without hemorrhage. Moreover, recent clinical-virological case reports and retrospective pathological-virological analyses of temporal arteries positive or negative for giant cell arteritis (GCA) indicate that extracranial VZV vasculopathy triggers the immunopathology of GCA. While many patients with GCA improve after corticosteroid treatment, prolonged corticosteroid use may potentiate VZV infection, leading to fatal vasculopathy in the brain and other organs.","['Nagel MA', 'Gilden D']",2016,16,2,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,Nagel MA and Gilden D.

We administered the high-titer VZV vaccine to 31 pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients without vaccine-type VZV infections. One patient developed varicella due to wild-type VZV 13 days after vaccination. No zoster developed after vaccination during a median follow-up period of 4.8 years from vaccination. No other adverse effects were observed. Eighteen of the 31 patients (58.1%) were seropositive after vaccination. Seventeen patients were vaccinated within 24 months after HSCT; the seropositivity of these patients did not significantly differ from that of patients vaccinated > 24 months after HSCT.

26740148,Health Advice from Internet Discussion Forums: How Bad Is Dangerous?,"BACKGROUND: Concerns over online health information-seeking behavior point to the potential harm incorrect, incomplete, or biased information may cause. However, systematic reviews of health information have found few examples of documented harm that can be directly attributed to poor quality information found online.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the quality and quality characteristics of information found in online discussion forum websites so that their likely value as a peer-to-peer health information-sharing platform could be assessed.
METHODS: A total of 25 health discussion threads were selected across 3 websites (Reddit, Mumsnet, and Patient) covering 3 health conditions (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], diabetes, and chickenpox). Assessors were asked to rate information found in the discussion threads according to 5 criteria: accuracy, completeness, how sensible the replies were, how they thought the questioner would act, and how useful they thought the questioner would find the replies.
RESULTS: In all, 78 fully completed assessments were returned by 17 individuals (8 were qualified medical doctors, 9 were not). When the ratings awarded in the assessments were analyzed, 25 of the assessments placed the discussion threads in the highest possible score band rating them between 5 and 10 overall, 38 rated them between 11 and 15, 12 rated them between 16 and 20, and 3 placed the discussion thread they assessed in the lowest rating band (21-25). This suggests that health threads on Internet discussion forum websites are more likely than not (by a factor of 4:1) to contain information of high or reasonably high quality. Extremely poor information is rare; the lowest available assessment rating was awarded only 11 times out of a possible 353, whereas the highest was awarded 54 times. Only 3 of 78 fully completed assessments rated a discussion thread in the lowest possible overall band of 21 to 25, whereas 25 of 78 rated it in the highest of 5 to 10. Quality assessments differed depending on the health condition (chickenpox appeared 17 times in the 20 lowest-rated threads, HIV twice, and diabetes once). Although assessors tended to agree on which discussion threads contained good quality information, what constituted poor quality information appeared to be more subjective.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the information assessed in this study was considered by qualified medical doctors and nonmedically qualified respondents to be of reasonably good quality. Although a small amount of information was assessed as poor, not all respondents agreed that the original questioner would have been led to act inappropriately based on the information presented. This suggests that discussion forum websites may be a useful platform through which people can ask health-related questions and receive answers of acceptable quality.","['Cole J', 'Watkins C', 'Kleine D']",2016,18,1,J Med Internet Res,"Cole J, et al.

In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; they summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines, and conclude with WHO's current position on the use of vaccines in the global context. This paper reflects the recommendations of WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization. These recommendations were discussed by SAGE at its April 2014 meeting.

28525225,[Vaccination before and during pregnancy].,"Vaccination of pregnant women is designed to protect the mother and the fetus from preventable diseases through vaccination. Authorized vaccines contain inactivated viruses, otherwise (l ive virus), they cannot be made during pregnancy. Vaccines offered in all circumstances are those against influenza, at any point in pregnancy, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, in the 3rd trimester. Hepatitis A and/or B, meningitis, pneumococcal, rabies, anthrax vaccines must be considered in post exposure. There is not enough data on vaccines against typhoid fever, Japanese encephalitis, cholera during the pregnancy. Vaccines to be done at distance of pregnancy are those against chickenpox, rubella, measles and mumps for unprotected women, as well as the vaccine against HPV, BCG, yellow fever and smallpox. In conclusion, only influenza vaccines and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis showed a safe profile during pregnancy. Other vaccines should be considered in the event of exposure to risk of illness with the help of an infectious disease specialist.","['Varlet E', 'Bernier M', 'Thibaut P']",2016,37,4,Rev Med Brux,"Varlet E, et al.

26693489,"Clinical and Etiological Characteristics of Atypical Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Children from Chongqing, China: A Retrospective Study.","BACKGROUND: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a disease that had similar manifestations to chickenpox, impetigo, and measles, which is easy to misdiagnose and subsequently causes delayed therapy and subsequent epidemic. To date, no study has been conducted to report the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of atypical HFMD.
METHODS: 64 children with atypical HFMD out of 887 HFMD children were recruited, stool was collected, and viral VP1 was detected.
RESULTS: The atypical HFMD accounted for 7.2% of total HFMD in the same period (64/887) and there were two peaks in its prevalence in nonepidemic seasons. Ten children (15.6%) had manifestations of neurologic involvement, of whom 4 (6.3%) were diagnosed with severe HFMD and 1 with critically severe HFMD, but all recovered smoothly. Onychomadesis and desquamation were found in 14 patients (21.9%) and 15 patients (23.4%), respectively. The most common pathogen was coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) which accounted for 67.2%, followed by nontypable enterovirus (26.6%), enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) (4.7%), and coxsackievirus A16 (A16) (1.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Atypical HFMD has seasonal prevalence. The manifestations of neurologic involvement in atypical HFMD are mild and usually have a good prognosis. CV-A6 is a major pathogen causing atypical HFMD, but not a major pathogen in Chongqing, China.","['Yan X', 'Zhang ZZ', 'Yang ZH', 'Zhu CM', 'Hu YG', 'Liu QB']",2015,2015,,Biomed Res Int,"Yan X, et al.

We herein report the first case, to our knowledge, of primary inoculation TB to be seen after varicella; this case explains the possible mechanism of varicella-zoster virus-mediated transient cellular immune suppression that predisposed the patient to cutaneous TB. In this case, we believe that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection predisposed the patient to primary inoculation TB by leading to direct inoculation of tuberculosis bacilli through vesicles or by suppressing cellular immunity.","['Polat M', 'Kara SS', 'Tapısız A', 'Tezer H', 'Öğüt B', 'Uluoğlu Ö']",2015,57,2,Turk J Pediatr,"Polat M, et al.

26690230,"Application of Oral Fluid Assays in Support of Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Control Programs.","Detection of specific viral antibody or nucleic acid produced by infection or immunization, using oral fluid samples, offers increased potential for wider population uptake compared to blood sampling. This methodology is well established for the control of HIV and measles infections, but can also be applied to the control of other vaccine preventable infections, and this review describes the application of oral fluid assays in support of mumps, rubella and varicella national immunization programs. In England and Wales individuals with suspected mumps or rubella, based on clinical presentation, can have an oral fluid swab sample taken for case confirmation. Universal varicella immunization of children has led to a drastic reduction of chickenpox in those countries where it is used; however, in England and Wales such a policy has not been instigated. Consequently, in England and Wales most children have had chickenpox by age 10 years; however, small, but significant, numbers of adults remain susceptible. Targeted varicella zoster virus (VZV) immunization of susceptible adolescents offers the potential to reduce the pool of susceptible adults and oral fluid determination of VZV immunity in adolescents is a potential means of identifying susceptible individuals in need of VZV vaccination. The main application of oral fluid testing is in those circumstances where blood sampling is deemed not necessary, or is undesirable, and when the documented sensitivity and specificity of the oral fluid assay methodology to be used is considered sufficient for the purpose intended.",['Maple PA'],2015,3,4,Vaccines (Basel),"Maple PA.

26630264,Structure of the Varicella Zoster Virus Thymidylate Synthase Establishes Functional and Structural Similarities as the Human Enzyme and Potentiates Itself as a Target of Brivudine.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a highly infectious human herpesvirus that is the causative agent for chicken pox and shingles. VZV encodes a functional thymidylate synthase (TS), which is the sole enzyme that produces dTMP from dUMP de novo. To study substrate binding, the complex structure of TSVZV with dUMP was determined to a resolution of 2.9 Å. In the absence of a folate co-substrate, dUMP binds in the conserved TS active site and is coordinated similarly as in the human encoded TS (TSHS) in an open conformation. The interactions between TSVZV with dUMP and a cofactor analog, raltitrexed, were also studied using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), suggesting that TSVZV binds dUMP and raltitrexed in a sequential binding mode like other TS. The DSF also revealed interactions between TSVZV and in vitro phosphorylated brivudine (BVDUP), a highly potent anti-herpesvirus drug against VZV infections. The binding of BVDUP to TSVZV was further confirmed by the complex structure of TSVZV and BVDUP solved at a resolution of 2.9 Å. BVDUP binds similarly as dUMP in the TSHS but it induces a closed conformation of the active site. The structure supports that the 5-bromovinyl substituent on BVDUP is likely to inhibit TSVZV by preventing the transfer of a methylene group from its cofactor and the subsequent formation of dTMP. The interactions between TSVZV and BVDUP are consistent with that TSVZV is indeed a target of brivudine in vivo. The work also provided the structural basis for rational design of more specific TSVZV inhibitors.","['Hew K', 'Dahlroth SL', 'Veerappan S', 'Pan LX', 'Cornvik T', 'Nordlund P']",2015,10,12,PLoS One,"Hew K, et al.

26629544,Distribution of Health Effects and Cost-effectiveness of Varicella Vaccination are Shaped by the Impact on Herpes Zoster.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of varicella and herpes zoster (HZ). It has been hypothesised that immune boosting of latently infected persons by contact with varicella reduces the probability of HZ. If true, universal varicella vaccination may increase HZ incidence due to reduced VZV circulation. To inform decision-making, we conduct cost-effectiveness analyses of varicella vaccination, including effects on HZ.
METHODS: Effects of varicella vaccination are simulated with a dynamic transmission model, parameterised with Dutch VZV seroprevalence and HZ incidence data, and linked to an economic model. We consider vaccination scenarios that differ by whether or not they include immune boosting, and reactivation of vaccine virus.
RESULTS: Varicella incidence decreases after introduction of vaccination, while HZ incidence may increase or decrease depending on whether or not immune boosting is present. Without immune boosting, vaccination is expected to be cost-effective or even cost-saving. With immune boosting, vaccination at 95% coverage is not expected to be cost-effective, and may even cause net health losses.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination depends strongly on the impact on HZ and the economic time horizon. Our findings reveal ethical dilemmas as varicella vaccination may result in unequal distribution of health effects between generations.","['van Lier A', 'Lugnér A', 'Opstelten W', 'Jochemsen P', 'Wallinga J', 'Schellevis F', 'Sanders E', 'de Melker H', 'van Boven M']",2015,2,10,EBioMedicine,"van Lier A, et al.

26615655,MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF VARICELLA SPREAD IN SLOVAKIA.,"AIM: Varicella is a highly contagious disease. In Slovakia, 15,000-30,000 cases are reported annually. However, vaccination against varicella is not widely used in Slovakia. The aim of this paper is to predict the influence of vaccination administrated in different ages on the disease occurrence in different age groups.
METHODS: Deterministic, age-stratified SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with stable population was used for prediction of varicella spread in Slovakia.
RESULTS: Vaccination of a group designated as 0 influences the proportion of susceptible and infected persons in all age groups, vaccination of 10 years old ones affects only the proportion of susceptible and infected individuals older than 10 years.
CONCLUSION: The increase of vaccination coverage should have a positive impact on the incidence of varicella in Slovakia. In case of vaccination coverage of 0 group in the range of 30-75%, it is necessary to pay attention to the protection of older children and adults.","['Zibolenová J', 'Szabóová V', 'Tibor B', 'Ševčovič D', 'Hudečková H']",2015,23,3,Cent Eur J Public Health,"Zibolenová J, et al.

However, measles virus continues to circulate, causing infection, illness, and an estimated 400 deaths worldwide each day. Measles is preventable by vaccine, and humans are the only reservoir. Clinicians should promote and provide on-time vaccination for all patients and keep measles in their differential diagnosis of febrile rash illness for rapid case detection, confirmation of measles infection, isolation, treatment, and appropriate public health response.","['Goodson JL', 'Seward JF']",2015,29,4,Infect Dis Clin North Am,Goodson JL and Seward JF.

26608932,Incidence and case-fatality of varicella-zoster virus infection among pediatric cancer patients in developing countries.,"UNLABELLED: Limited evidence is available about varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection among pediatric cancer patients in developing countries, which raises questions about the generalizability of VZV vaccine recommendations for pediatric cancer patients (derived from developed countries) to these settings. We assessed the incidence and case-fatality of VZV infection at three institutions in developing countries (Argentina, Mexico, and Nicaragua). Individuals eligible for our study were aged <20 years and actively receiving cancer-directed therapy. We estimated a summary incidence rate (IR) and case-fatality risk with corresponding 95 % confidence limits (CL) of VZV infection across sites using random-effects models. Our study population comprised 511 pediatric cancer patients, of whom 64 % were aged <10 years, 58 % were male, and 58 % were diagnosed with leukemia. We observed a total of 10 infections during 44,401 person-days of follow-up across the 3 sites (IR = 2.3, 95 % CL 1.2, 4.2). The summary case-fatality risk was 10 % (95 % CL 1.4, 47 %) based on one death.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest low incidence and case-fatality of VZV infections among pediatric cancer patients in three developing countries. VZV vaccine recommendations for pediatric cancer patients in developed countries may be generalizable to developing countries.
WHAT IS KNOWN: • Current recommendations, based on evidence from pediatric cancer patients in developed countries, contraindicate varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination until completion of cancer-directed therapy and recovery of immune function. • The generalizability of these VZV vaccine recommendations to pediatric cancer patients in developing countries is unknown because of limited information about the incidence and case-fatality of VZV in these settings. What is New: • Our results suggest low incidence and case-fatality of VZV infections among pediatric cancer patients in three developing countries. • VZV vaccine recommendations based on evidence from pediatric cancer patients in developed countries may be generalizable to pediatric cancer patients in developing countries.","['Ojha RP', 'Stallings-Smith S', 'Aviles-Robles MJ', 'Gomez S', 'Somarriba MM', 'Caniza MA']",2016,175,4,Eur J Pediatr,"Ojha RP, et al.

26564178,Vaccinations and childhood type 1 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of observational studies.,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between routine vaccinations and the risk of childhood type 1 diabetes mellitus by systematically reviewing the published literature and performing meta-analyses where possible.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed of MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify all studies that compared vaccination rates in children who subsequently developed type 1 diabetes mellitus and in control children. ORs and 95% CIs were obtained from published reports or derived from individual patient data and then combined using a random effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 23 studies investigating 16 vaccinations met the inclusion criteria. Eleven of these contributed to meta-analyses which included data from between 359 and 11,828 childhood diabetes cases. Overall, there was no evidence to suggest an association between any of the childhood vaccinations investigated and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The pooled ORs ranged from 0.58 (95% CI 0.24, 1.40) for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination in five studies up to 1.04 (95% CI 0.94, 1.14) for the haemophilus influenza B (HiB) vaccination in 11 studies. Significant heterogeneity was present in most of the pooled analyses, but was markedly reduced when analyses were restricted to study reports with high methodology quality scores. Neither this restriction by quality nor the original authors' adjustments for potential confounding made a substantial difference to the pooled ORs.

26555677,Varicella seroprevalence in healthcare workers in a tertiary hospital: an audit of cross-sectional data.,"BACKGROUND: The seroprevalence of varicella in Southeast Asia is not well described especially in healthcare workers (HCW) in the region. We report the varicella seroprevalence among healthcare workers from a diverse range of countries working in a tertiary care hospital in Singapore.
METHODS: We audited the results of annual HCW health screening, which included a varicella assay, from the years 2009 to 2014. During this period, there was a change in hospital policy mandating varicella immunity for all newly employed healthcare workers. The serological data were reviewed with employment records on occupation and nationality. Seroprevalence rates were determined by standard commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for each year of testing. Odds of being immune in 2014 were compared by means of multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 10,585 samples were obtained from 6668 unique individuals over four separate cross-sections of the hospital workforce. A peak seroprevalence of 92.8 % (95 % CI 92.0-93.5) was recorded in 2014. Younger employees had a lower seroprevalence than their older colleagues. In a consolidated sample of 4875 members of the active workforce in October 2014, we identified that Indian nationals were less likely to be immune than their Singaporean national colleagues, odds ratio (OR) 0.26 (95 % CI 0.17-0.43, p < 0.001), while Chinese nationals were more likely to be immune, OR 4.34 (95 % CI 1.61-12.2, p = 0.004), after controlling for year of screening, gender, age-group and vocation. In 2014, being employed as administrative staff, OR 0.43 (95 % CI 0.29-0.64, p < 0.001) or contract service provider, OR 0.30 (95 % CI 0.19-0.47, p < 0.001), was also associated with a lower odds of being immune than being employed as a nurse.
CONCLUSIONS: There remain a small number of healthcare workers who are non-immune to varicella in our tertiary hospital. A new pre-employment policy of mandatory screening and vaccination may have increased rates of immunity but more needs to be done to ensure that all of our employees are immune to varicella to protect our vulnerable patients.","['Gorny AW', 'Mittal C', 'Saw S', 'Venkatachalam I', 'Fisher DA', 'Tambyah PA']",2015,8,,BMC Res Notes,"Gorny AW, et al.

This study was undertaken to synthesize current research findings of the immunogenicity and safety of MMRV in healthy children.We searched PubMed, Embase, BIOSIS Previews, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and other databases through September 9, 2014. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected and collected independently by 2 reviewers. Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 12.0 and RevMan 5.3.Twenty-four RCTs were included in qualitative synthesis. Nineteen RCTs compared single MMRV dose with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine with or without varicella vaccine (MMR + V/MMR). Similar seroconversion rates of these 4 viruses were found between comparison groups. There were comparable geometric mean titers (GMTs) against mumps and varicella viruses between MMRV group and MMR + V/MMR group. MMRV group achieved enhanced immune response to measles component, with GMT ratio of 1.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48, 1.86; P < 0.001) for MMRV versus MMR and 1.62 (95% CI 1.51, 1.70; P < 0.001) for MMRV versus MMR + V. Meanwhile, immune response to rubella component in MMRV group was slightly reduced, GMT ratios were 0.81 (95% CI 0.78, 0.85; P < 0.001) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.76, 0.83; P < 0.001), respectively. Well tolerated safety profiles were demonstrated except higher incidence of fever (relative risks 1.12-1.60) and measles/rubella-like rash (relative risks 1.44-1.45) in MMRV groups.MMRV had comparable immunogenicity and overall safety profiles to MMR + V/MMR in healthy children based on current evidence.","['Ma SJ', 'Li X', 'Xiong YQ', 'Yao AL', 'Chen Q']",2015,94,44,Medicine (Baltimore),"Ma SJ, et al.

26548293,[Evaluation of the Number of Varicella Patients Estimated by Prescription Surveillance].,"OBJECT: It is important to know the precise number of varicella patients infected for evaluation of routine immunization and anti-bioterrorism attack using smallpox. Prescription Surveillance (PS) has been providing the estimated number of varicella patients up to the present. However, the estimated number of varicella patients cannot be validated because to date there has been no other comparable precise method of estimation. Recently, all electronic medical claims nationwide (NDB) have been disclosed. In this paper, we compare the number of varicella patients estimated by PS with NDB data, and adjust the number estimated with PS, if necessary.
METHOD: For both NDB and PS, we used the monthly data from April, 2010 to March, 2013. The estimation of the number of varicella patients from the PS data was adjusted by the proportion of estimated number based on PS to the one based on NDB in the entire study period. Moreover, we adjusted it month by month, if the former method may not be enough to compensate for the discrepancy between the two datasets.
RESULTS: The average discrepancy between NDB and PS was 48.00% in three years. By the adjustment using NDB in the three years, the discrepancy was improved to 11.49%. However, seasonal patterns of overestimation or underestimation were found. Conversely, by the adjustment using NDB month by month, the discrepancy was greatly reduced to 4.33%. Moreover, the seasonal patterns of overestimation or underestimation disappeared.
CONCLUSION: The number of patients based on NDB would appear the most precise number, however, there may be a delay of about one year before it becomes available. On the other hand, PS data are updated every day and provide us with the up-to-date situation. This paper found that combining the timeliness of the PS data and preciseness of the NDB data will provide substantial benefit for public health.","['Nakamura Y', 'Kawanohara H', 'Kamei M']",2015,89,1,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Nakamura Y, et al.

Varicella is an airborne disease which usually affects children before the age of 10. Because of its nature, varicella gives rise to interesting spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal patterns. This paper studies spatio-temporal exploratory analysis tools to detect specific behaviour of varicella in the city of Valencia, Spain, from 2008 to 2013. These methods have shown a significant association between the spatial and the temporal component, confirmed by the space-time models applied to the data.

We analyzed the cohort of individuals actively invited for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccination in the Veneto region (north-east Italy) from 8/1/2013 to 7/31/2014, assessing the onset of adverse events (AE) relating to 2 different vaccination strategies for MMRV (MMR+V vs MMRV). During the vaccination session at 14 months old, parents were given a form for recording local and systemic reactions to vaccinations for 4 weeks afterwards. Overall, 12,288 forms were returned, and 84.6% of them were included in this analysis (5,130 relating to MMR+V and 5,265 to MMRV); 37.3% of the sample reported no AEs, with no difference between the 2 groups. Local reactions were more common in the MMR+V group (9.6% vs 2.9%; RR 3.33; 95% CI 2.79-3.98), while there was no difference in general reactions between the 2 groups (50% MMR+V vs 52% MMRV). The events most often reported were ""fever <39.5°C,"" which was more frequently associated with the MMRV strategy (p<0.001), and ""skin blotches and marks,"" which occurred more often in the MMR+V group (p<0.001). Reports of ""fever ≥39.5°C"" were equally distributed between the 2 groups. Sixteen cases of febrile seizures were reported (0.14% in the MMR+V group and 0.17% in the MMRV group). Similar safety profiles were identified for the 2 vaccination strategies. Although the method used to record reactions to vaccination demanded considerable resources, it enabled important information to be collected on parents' perception of the AEs occurring in response to their child's vaccination.","['Cocchio S', 'Zanoni G', 'Opri R', 'Russo F', 'Baldo V', 'Collaborative group']",2016,12,3,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Cocchio S, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bibliographic searches were performed with PubMed and Cochrane databases, and within national guidelines and their references.
RESULTS: Women that have not got vaccinated in the past 10 years should receive a dose of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-poliomyelitis vaccine in the early post-partum, and the family and friends should be included in the cocooning strategy (professional consensus). During seasonal influenza epidemic, influenza vaccine should be offered to women, who were not vaccinated during pregnancy, and delivered a vulnerable neonate (professional consensus). For all other women, the vaccination can be discussed on a case-by-case basis (professional consensus). In order to prevent congenital or neonatal varicella in a subsequent pregnancy, scientific data are weak to suggest a systematic screening and vaccination against varicella in women with no history or uncertain status about varicella, excepted in women coming from sub-Saharan Africa, East and Central Europe, more likely to have a negative serology for varicella (professional consensus). In order to prevent severe varicella in adulthood, the vaccination should be discussed with potentially seronegative women as recommended by the French High Council for Public Health (professional consensus). Rubella vaccine is recommended in the early post-partum with women with negative serology during pregnancy with a dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (professional consensus). A new pregnancy should be avoided in the month following rubella and varicella vaccination, but contraception is not obligatory (professional consensus).

DESIGN: Varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated using the ""screening method"", based on vaccine coverage (VC) at 24 months and proportion of vaccinated subjects among varicella notified cases (PVC), verified through the Local Health Units' (LHUs) immunization registries. Breakthrough varicella (BV) was defined as a case of varicella occurring in a child vaccinated ≥42 days before the date of disease onset.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in the 12 Tuscan LHUs and included all varicella cases notified in 2010-2013 in children of the birth cohorts 2008-2011.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BV cases; VE after one dose of varicella vaccine; time interval between varicella vaccination and symptom onset.
RESULTS: VC was 79.8%, VE reached 90.8%(95%CI 89.5%-92.0%) and the proportion of BV among notified cases was 26.6%. The median time interval between vaccination and symptom onset was 25 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The very low rate of BV cases among vaccinated children confirms the high effectiveness even of a single dose of varicella vaccine and does not support a change of the current immunization schedule.","['Pieri L', 'Porchia BR', 'Pieralli F', 'Varone O', 'Niccolai G', 'Roselli A', 'Boccalini S', 'Bonanni P', 'Bechini A', 'Working Group of Tuscan LHU’s', ""Working Group of Tuscan LHU's""]",2015,39,4 Suppl 1,Epidemiol Prev,"Pieri L, et al.

26475868,Encephalitis in Australian children: contemporary trends in hospitalisation.,"OBJECTIVE: The clinical epidemiology of childhood encephalitis in Australia is inadequately understood. We aimed to describe recent trends in childhood encephalitis-related hospitalisation.
STUDY DESIGN: We identified encephalitis-related hospital admissions (2000-2012) in national datasets among children ≤14 years using ICD encephalitis codes. We calculated hospitalisation rates and analysed trends by year, age, gender, location, indigenous status and aetiology.
RESULTS: Rates of childhood encephalitis hospitalisations significantly declined over an 11-year period (2000-2012; average hospitalisation rate 3.2/100 000). Varicella encephalitis hospitalisations decreased significantly, associated with high levels of varicella vaccine coverage since 2006. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was the most common 'specified' cause of encephalitis hospitalisation (15%-17%), and its rate has significantly increased. The highest hospitalisation rates occurred in the <1 year age group (5.8/100 000) and varied by location (highest in Northern Territory). The majority (58.9%) of hospitalised encephalitis had no cause identified; this proportion was highest in the <1 year age group (77%). The most common specified infectious causes included: herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, bacterial meningoencephalitis and varicella. When aggregated, the proportion of childhood encephalitis coded as viral was 21.2%.
CONCLUSION: Hospitalisation of childhood encephalitis has slightly decreased in Australia. High rates of childhood immunisation have been associated with a reduction of varicella-associated encephalitis in Australian children. ADEM, an immune-mediated encephalitis, is the most common recognised cause of encephalitis in children. Young children (<1 year) have the highest admission rates. The high proportion of 'unspecified' encephalitis deaths and hospitalisations is an ongoing challenge.","['Britton PN', 'Khoury L', 'Booy R', 'Wood N', 'Jones CA']",2016,101,1,Arch Dis Child,"Britton PN, et al.

26470958,Outbreak of chickenpox in a Union Territory of North India.,"PURPOSE: Primary infection with a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) leads to chickenpox. Though the incidence of the disease has decreased in many developed countries due to the introduction of the varicella vaccine, outbreaks continue to occur in developing countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study reports an outbreak of varicella in an urbanised village in the vicinity of Chandigarh City in North India in November 2013. The outbreak was confirmed by the detection of VZV IgM antibodies in serum samples of clinically suspected patients. Vesicular fluid samples were collected from 8 patients with active lesions and tested for VZV DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Blood samples were also collected from 17 healthy controls residing in the same locality and tested for the presence of VZV IgM and IgG antibodies.
RESULTS: A total of 18 cases occurred, and the majority of them (67%) were <15 years of age. Of 17 samples collected from patients with the clinically suspected disease, 13 (76.5%) showed the presence of VZV IgM antibodies. Of the healthy controls, 6 were VZV IgM positive and 4 of them developed symptomatic disease on follow-up. VZV DNA was positive in 5/8 (62.5%) of the patients. In one patient, VZV DNA was detected in the absence of an IgM antibody response.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of varicella vaccine in the universal immunisation programme of India may help to prevent these outbreaks; however, the cost-benefit analysis needs to be carried out before making such policies.","['Singh MP', 'Chandran C', 'Sarwa A', 'Kumar A', 'Gupta M', 'Raj A', 'Ratho RK']",2015,33,4,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Singh MP, et al.

26412393,"Using Locally Derived Seroprevalence Data on Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella by Birth Cohort to Determine Risks for Vaccine-Preventable Diseases During International Travel.","BACKGROUND: Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) were common childhood diseases in the United States prior to the introduction of their respective vaccines. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. However, 628 cases were reported in 2014, the majority of which have been linked to international travel. The study team set out to investigate the seroprevalence of MMRV in our local population to determine whether such a process can lead to meaningful recommendations for assessing travelers at risk.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study using a quota sampling method. A total of 460 leftover serum samples were collected from individuals born prior to 1996, who live in the Lehigh Valley region of southeast Pennsylvania. The samples were allocated to five birth-year cohorts, and the seroprevalence of each cohort to MMRV was compared. Additionally, overall seroprevalence of each disease was compared with data from prior national studies. Gender differences within each birth cohort were also assessed.
RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence values of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella were 85.8, 82.8, 96.6, and 97.4%, respectively. There were significant associations between seroprevalence and birth cohort for measles (p = 0.01) as well as mumps (p = 0.037). The overall seroprevalence for our study sample was significantly different from the national seroprevalence results of measles, mumps, and rubella.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed dramatically lower immunity rates for measles and mumps than those shown by prior national seroprevalence studies. The rates in many of the later birth cohorts born after 1966 were significantly lower than the rates reported as necessary to sustain herd immunity. Given that patients' immunization records are not always available or complete, collecting local seroprevalence data may be necessary to more accurately recommend antibody testing and vaccination during pre-travel assessments.","['Rosario-Rosario G', 'Gareca M', 'Kincaid H', 'Knouse MC']",2015,22,6,J Travel Med,"Rosario-Rosario G, et al.

26407276,Impact of the Maturing Varicella Vaccination Program on Varicella and Related Outcomes in the United States: 1994-2012.,"BACKGROUND: Although the 1-dose varicella vaccination program, introduced in 1996, has led to significant declines in varicella disease, outbreaks continued to occur, which led to the adoption of a 2-dose vaccination program in 2007. We previously reported an 88% decline in varicella-related hospitalizations and a 59% decline in outpatient visits during 1994-2002. We now update data on varicella healthcare utilization with 10 years of additional data, during a period of stabilizing first-dose coverage and rapidly increasing second-dose coverage.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using claims data from 1994-2012 Truven Health MarketScan databases. We examined trends in rates of varicella-related outpatient visits and hospitalizations for MarketScan enrollees aged 0-49 years, including outpatient laboratory testing, outpatient antiviral use, and pediatric strokes, with 1994-1995 as the prevaccination period and 2006-2012 as the 2-dose varicella vaccination period.
RESULTS: Varicella outpatient visits declined 84% in 2012 versus the prevaccination period, with a 60% decline during the 2-dose period. Varicella hospitalizations declined 93% in 2012 versus the prevaccination period, with a 38% decline during the 2-dose period. The proportion of those with a varicella outpatient visit having varicella laboratory testing increased from 6% in 2003 to 17% in 2012. There were 21 445 (17%) with a claim for antivirals, which was relatively stable over time. There was no reduction in pediatric strokes during 1994-2012.

26385992,Prevalence and Persistence of Varicella Antibodies in Previously Immunized Children and Youth With Perinatal HIV-1 Infection.,"BACKGROUND: Two doses of live-attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine are recommended for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected children with CD4% ≥ 15%. We determined the prevalence and persistence of antibody in immunized children with perinatal HIV (PHIV) and their association with number of vaccinations, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and HIV status.
METHODS: The Adolescent Master Protocol is an observational study of children with PHIV and perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) children conducted at 15 US sites. In a cross-sectional analysis, we tested participants' most recent stored sera for varicella antibody using whole-cell and glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seropositivity predictors were identified using multivariable logistic regression models and C statistics.
RESULTS: Samples were available for 432 children with PHIV and 221 PHEU children; 82% of children with PHIV and 97% of PHEU children were seropositive (P < .001). Seropositivity after 1 vaccine dose among children with PHIV and PHEU children was 100% at <3 years (both), 73% and 100% at 3-<7 years (P < .05), and 77% and 97% at ≥ 7 years (P < .01), respectively. Seropositivity among recipients of 2 vaccine doses was >94% at all intervals. Independent predictors of seropositivity among children with PHIV were receipt of 2 vaccine doses, receipt of 1 dose while on ≥ 3 months of cART, compared with none (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 14.0 and 2.8, respectively; P < .001 for overall dose effect), and in those vaccinated ≥ 3 years previously, duration of cART (aOR: 1.29 per year increase, P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Humoral immune responses to varicella vaccine are best achieved when children with PHIV receive their first dose ≥ 3 months after cART initiation and maintained by completion of the 2-dose series and long-term cART use.","['Purswani MU', 'Karalius B', 'Yao TJ', 'Schmid DS', 'Burchett SK', 'Siberry GK', 'Patel K', 'Van Dyke RB', 'Yogev R', 'Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS)', 'Lurie RH', 'Yogev R', 'Sanders MA', 'Malee K', 'Hunter S', 'Shearer W', 'Paul M', 'Cooper N', 'Harris L', 'Purswani M', 'Baig M', 'Cintron A', 'Puga A', 'Navarro S', 'Garvie P', 'Blood J', 'Burchett S', 'Karthas N', 'Kammerer B', 'Wiznia A', 'Burey M', 'Nozyce M', 'Dieudonne A', 'Bettica L', 'Adubato S', 'Chen J', 'Bulkley MG', 'Ivey L', 'Grant M', 'Knapp K', 'Allison K', 'Wilkins M', 'Acevedo-Flores M', 'Rios H', 'Olivera V', 'Silio M', 'Jones M', 'Sirois P', 'Spector S', 'Norris K', 'Nichols S', 'McFarland E', 'Katai A', 'Dunn J', 'Paul S', 'Scott G', 'Bryan P', 'Willen E']",2016,62,1,Clin Infect Dis,"Purswani MU, et al.

26359506,Trends and socioeconomic disparities in preadolescent's health in the UK: evidence from two birth cohorts 32 years apart.,"BACKGROUND: Compared to children and adults, little is known about changes in adolescent health over time. This study profiles the health of preadolescents in two distinct time periods, 1980 and 2012.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of the British Cohort Study and the Millennium Cohort Study for preadolescents mostly aged between 10 and 11.5 years (range 9.75-13 years). The prevalence/average of, and socioeconomic gradients in, the following were compared between 1980 and 2012; general health problems, anthropometrics, allergic conditions, infectious diseases, health service use, smoking and parental smoking behaviour and maternal adiposity. Socioeconomic status was measured by familial income (3 groups).
RESULTS: There were decreases in the proportion of hospital admissions (Δ=-0.10(-0.09:-0.11)) smoking (Δ=-0.12(-0.11:-0.13)), parental smoking (mother: (Δ=-0.19(-0.18:-0.21)) father: (Δ=-0.35(-0.34:-0.37), infectious diseases (measles: (Δ=-0.46(-0.45:-0.47)) whooping cough: (Δ=-0.07(-0.06:-0.07)) and hearing problems (Δ=-0.04(-0.03:-0.05)). There were no changes in limiting long-standing illness (Δ=0.00 (-0.00:0.00)), or the proportion of children having two or more accidents requiring medical attention (Δ=-0.02(-0.00:-0.02)). There were increases in the proportion overweight (Δ=0.18(0.17:0.19)), maternal overweight(Δ=0.22(0.21:0.23)) and obesity(Δ=0.12(0.11:0.13)), height for age(Δ=0.47(0.44:0.49)), weight for age (Δ=0.68(0.65:0.71)), proportion reporting chicken pox (Δ=0.28(0.27:0.29)), allergic conditions (eczema Δ=0.19(0.18:0.20)), asthma Δ=0.12(0.11:0.13), hay fever Δ=0.15(0.14:0.16)) and wearing glasses (Δ=0.08(0.07:0.09)). There were increases in socioeconomic gradients for limiting long-standing illness, smoking, overweight, weight for age, height for age, wearing glasses, asthma and the onset of puberty.
CONCLUSIONS: There have been reductions in infectious diseases and tobacco exposure among British preadolescents, but overweight and allergic conditions have risen dramatically. Children from deprived families have benefitted least from improvements in health status, and have experienced the largest increases in health risks.","['Shackleton N', 'Hale D', 'Viner RM']",2016,70,2,J Epidemiol Community Health,"Shackleton N, et al.

26356985,Management of varicella-zoster virus primary infection during pregnancy: A national survey of practice.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella (VZV) infection in pregnancy can result in serious outcomes: maternal pneumoniae irrespective of the term of pregnancy, and lead to congenital varicella syndrome before 18 weeks of gestation and neonatal varicella. There are between 350 and 500 cases a year in France. Until now, there have been no scientific obstetrical guidelines for clinical practice in France for VZV infection during pregnancy.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate health care providers' knowledge and practices concerning varicella infection during pregnancy in France.
STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous survey on VZV infection was sent by e-mail to gynecologists-obstetricians and midwives. We evaluated their knowledge and practices concerning VZV transmission, maternal varicella, congenital varicella syndrome, neonatal varicella and prevention.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 271 professionals: gynecologists (161/271; 60%) and midwives (110/271; 40%). Among 20 items, 5 were multiple choice questions. 29 correct answers were expected. Scores ranged from 6/29 to 28/29 (mean score: 17.44/29).
CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of VZV primary infection in pregnancy are poorly known. We reveal a diversity of management among practitioners in our study population, not always in accordance with the international scientific literature or with the guidelines of other countries. Health care providers should update their knowledge of varicella infection during pregnancy. The publication of national guidelines could help to achieve this objective.","['Benoit G', 'Etchemendigaray C', 'Nguyen-Xuan HT', 'Vauloup-Fellous C', 'Ayoubi JM', 'Picone O']",2015,72,,J Clin Virol,"Benoit G, et al.

26356725,Parental Attitudes and Factors Associated With Varicella Vaccination in Preschool and Schoolchildren in Hong Kong: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"This study investigates parental attitudes and factors associated with varicella vaccination among preschool and schoolchildren prior to introduction of the vaccine into Hong Kong's universal Childhood Immunization Program.Fourteen kindergartens and 5 primary schools in Hong Kong were randomly selected in 2013. Parents of the students were invited to answer the self-administered questionnaires. Acquired information included demographic characteristics and socioeconomic statuses of families, children's history of chickenpox infection and vaccination, and reasons for getting children vaccinated. Logistic regression was applied to examine the factors associated with vaccination.From the 3484 completed questionnaires, the calculated rates of varicella infection and vaccination were 20.7% and 69.0%, respectively. Barriers to vaccination included parental uncertainties about vaccine effectiveness, lack of recommendation from the government, and concerns on adverse effects. Overall, 71.8%, 69.0%, and 45.7% of the parents rated family doctors, specialists, and the government, respectively, as very important motivators of vaccination. Higher parental educational level and family income, better perceived knowledge of varicella and chance of infection, discussion with a family doctor, and positive health belief towards vaccination were associated with vaccination (all P < 0.05).The rate of vaccination in Hong Kong was higher than that of some other countries that also did not include the vaccine in their routine immunization programs. More positive parental attitudes, higher socioeconomic status, and discussion with a family doctor are associated with greater vaccination rates. The important roles that health professionals and the government play in promoting varicella vaccination were emphasized.","['Tam WWS', 'Chan J', 'Lo KKH', 'Lee A', 'Chan PKS', 'Chan D', 'Nelson EAS']",2015,94,36,Medicine (Baltimore),"Tam WWS, et al.

26330271,Seroepidemiology of varicella among elementary school children in northern Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: In Taiwan, varicella vaccine was included in the expanded program of immunization since 2004. A seroepidemiologic study in the postvaccine era is helpful to evaluate the efficiency of current varicella vaccination strategies.
METHODS: We used a multistage stratified systematic sampling design to classify 29 administrative districts of New Taipei City into five strata. In 2013, a total of 936 students from 14 primary schools were recruited and had blood drawn for serology tests for varicella-zoster virus-immunoglobulin-G via indirect chemiluminescence immunoassays. A history of clinical varicella and information on varicella vaccination status were obtained.
RESULTS: Overall, the seroprevalence was 64.1%. For the five strata, the seropositive rate ranged from 54.2% (Stratum 5) to 71.7% (Stratum 2) with no significant difference. For each participating school, the seropositive rate ranged from 44.4% to 72.9% with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.005). For school children in each grade, seropositive rate increased significantly from 53.2% for Grade 1 to 71.8% for Grade 3 (p = 0.005) and increased steadily from 61.2% for Grade 4 to 71.2% for Grade 6 (p = 0.17). A positive correlation was observed between the seropositive rate and geometric mean titers (p = 0.035). Geometric mean titers and the rate of a history of clinical varicella were positively correlated with increasing class grades.
CONCLUSION: Nine years after the introduction of the varicella vaccine into the expanded program of immunization in Taiwan, around two-thirds of elementary schoolchildren were seropositive for varicella-zoster virus. Further surveillance studies on clinical varicella cases are worthwhile to determine whether a second dose of varicella vaccine is needed in Taiwan.","['Lin MR', 'Kuo CC', 'Hsieh YC', 'Huang YL', 'Huang YC', 'Hung YT', 'Huang YC']",2017,50,3,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Lin MR, et al.

26313471,"Vaccination Coverage Among Children in Kindergarten - United States, 2014-15 School Year.","State and local jurisdictions require children to be vaccinated before starting school to maintain high vaccination coverage and protect schoolchildren from vaccine-preventable diseases. State vaccination requirements, which include school vaccination and exemption laws and health department regulations, permit medical exemptions for students with a medical contraindication to receiving a vaccine or vaccine component and may allow nonmedical exemptions for religious reasons or philosophic beliefs. To monitor state and national vaccination coverage and exemption levels among children attending kindergarten, CDC analyzes school vaccination data collected by federally funded state, local, and territorial immunization programs. This report describes vaccination coverage estimates in 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) and vaccination exemption estimates in 46 states and DC that reported the number of children with at least one exemption among kindergartners during the 2014-15 school year. Median vaccination coverage* was 94.0% for 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine; 94.2% for the local requirements for diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP); and 93.6% for 2 doses of varicella vaccine among the 39 states and DC with a 2-dose requirement. The median percentage of any exemptions† was 1.7%. Although statewide vaccination coverage among kindergartners was high during the 2014-15 school year, geographic pockets of low vaccination coverage and high exemption levels can place children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Appropriate school vaccination coverage assessments can help immunization programs identify clusters of low coverage and develop partnerships with schools and communities to ensure that children are protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.","['Seither R', 'Calhoun K', 'Knighton CL', 'Mellerson J', 'Meador S', 'Tippins A', 'Greby SM', 'Dietz V']",2015,64,33,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Seither R, et al.

A recent analysis concluded that routine childhood vaccination will prevent 322 million cases of disease and about 732,000 early deaths among children born during 1994-2013, for a net societal cost savings of $1.38 trillion. The National Immunization Survey (NIS) has monitored vaccination coverage among U.S. children aged 19-35 months since 1994. This report presents national, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage estimates for children born from January 2011 through May 2013, based on data from the 2014 NIS. For most vaccinations, there was no significant change in coverage between 2013 and 2014. The exception was hepatitis A vaccine (HepA), for which increases were observed in coverage with both ≥1 and ≥2 doses. As in previous years, <1% of children received no vaccinations. National coverage estimates indicate that the Healthy People 2020 target* of 90% was met for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (93.3%), ≥1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) (91.5%), ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) (91.6%), and ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine (91.0%).

Children from households classified as below the federal poverty level had lower estimated coverage for almost all of the vaccinations assessed, compared with children living at or above the poverty level. Significant variation in coverage by state¶ was observed for several vaccinations, including HepB birth dose, HepA, and rotavirus.

METHODS: A total of 57 180 subjects for the consecutive 4-year birth cohorts were selected from the local children born between 2007 and 2010 in Yinzhou District, Ninghai County and Yuyao City. And they were followed up for varicella from 2008 to 2013. The recipients of the vaccinations were identified through Ningbo Immunization Information System and data on breakthrough infections among the recipients were collected by using China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. The breakthrough varicella rate and the VE were calculated and the trends of them were described from 2008 to 2013 among 4-year birth cohorts. The cumulative incidence of varicella was compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated children among the consecutive 4-year birth cohorts.
RESULTS: The rate of varicella vaccine coverage, vaccine cumulative incidence among the cohorts was 96.74% (55 317/57 180) and 0.56% (321/57 180). The breakthrough varicella infection for 4-year birth cohorts was 0.44% (244/55 317), and for each birth cohort was 0.95% (142/14 928), 0.44% (61/13 855), 0.22% (29/13 433) and 0.09% (12/13 101), respectively.

METHODS: Epidemiological data of varicella outbreaks in school and kindergarten settings, which were reported by all 16 districts (county) during 2007-2013 according to the technical management norms of Beijing, was collected. The first dose and second dose varicella vaccine coverage rate of eligible children after the 2 dose varicella vaccine immunization strategy implementation were estimated through BJIIMS. Based on above we analyzed the changes of outbreak quantity, case quantity and the distribution characteristics between the pre-adjustment era (2007-2011 years) and late adjustment era (2013) of the 2 dose immunization strategy.
RESULTS: In pre-adjustment era (2007-2011 years), an average of 74 (95% CI: 60-89) outbreaks was reported and 964 (95% CI: 812-1 116) cases were involved per year. In late adjustment era (2013): Outbreaks (35) declined 52.7%, involved cases (371) declined 61.5%; Outbreaks epidemic duration shortened from 22 days of pre-adjustment era to 18 days; Outbreaks involved 10-24 cases declined 64.7% (from 34 to 12); Outbreaks involved ≥ 25 cases declined 71.4% (from 7 to 2); Outbreaks of different school type as well as different regions without exception declined dramatically. Cumulative one-dose vaccine coverage in children of 2-6 yr of age was 89.6% (812 859/907 579), and cumulative second-dose vaccine coverage in children of 4-7 yr of age was 44.3% (289 764/647 732).

VZV reactivation is subject to the opposing mechanisms of declining and boosted VZV-specific cellular mediated immunity (CMI). A reduction in exogenous re-exposure 'opportunities' through universal chickenpox vaccination could therefore lead to an increase in HZ incidence. We present the first individual-based model that integrates within-host data on VZV-CMI and between-host transmission data to simulate HZ incidence. This model allows estimating currently unknown pivotal biomedical parameters, including the duration of exogenous boosting at 2 years, with a peak threefold to fourfold increase of VZV-CMI; the VZV weekly reactivation probability at 5% and VZV subclinical reactivation having no effect on VZV-CMI. A 100% effective chickenpox vaccine given to 1 year olds would cause a 1.75 times peak increase in HZ 31 years after implementation. This increase is predicted to occur mainly in younger age groups than is currently assumed.","['Ogunjimi B', 'Willem L', 'Beutels P', 'Hens N']",2015,4,,Elife,"Ogunjimi B, et al.

CONCLUSION: Preventive vaccination of servicemen allows to minimize the spread of chicken pox, however can not serve as means of complete elimination of the infection from military collectives.","['Dubodelov DV', 'Rybin VV', 'Rikhter VV', 'Yaroslavtsev VV', 'Gritsik AA', 'Kazanova AS', 'Lavrov VF', 'Semenenko TA', 'Kuzin SN']",2015,,3,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Dubodelov DV, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Material from 35 patients with clinical manifestations of herpes zoster and control group of 20 healthy donors was used in the study. Monocyte fraction of venous blood cells, pretreated with heparin, was isolated by centrifugation in ficoll-verografin density gradient, total DNA was then isolated from cells by phenol-chloroform extraction with subsequent precipitation with alcohol. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out in thermocyclers Tercyc and TProfessional Gradient (Biometra), amplified DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.6% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide.
RESULTS: Data on detection of viral DNA in blood monocytes in 17 (49%) of ill patients, as well as in 1 (out of 20 in control group) practically healthy donor were obtained. A possibility of a subclinical reactivation of the virus is discussed in the latter case.
CONCLUSION: A possibility of viral DNA determination in monocytes of patient blood without using expensive equipment is shown, that could find application in clinical practice, especially for diagnostics of patients with non-characteristic clinical manifestations, as well as patients with subclinical forms of the disease.","['Fam KhF', 'Borovikova EA', 'Sidorov AV', 'Karataeva AV', 'Antonova TP', 'Zverev VV']",2015,,3,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Fam KhF, et al.

26251259,"Modelling Hospitalisation Ratios for Febrile Convulsions and Severe Varicella Under Combined Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (MMRV-Priorix-Tetra™) Compared to Separate MMR + V Vaccination.","INTRODUCTION: Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella combination vaccines (MMRV) facilitate varicella vaccination uptake compared with separate administration of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) with varicella vaccine (V). However, the risk of developing febrile convulsions (FC) is higher in children vaccinated with MMRV.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to demonstrate how to put the increased FC risk associated with MMRV into perspective by comparing it with the lower V-coverage risk associated with MMR + V.
METHODS: FC and varicella burdens were measured by total numbers or duration of hospitalisations. A model, based on several assumptions and integrating parameters from heterogeneous data sources relevant to Germany, was developed to evaluate hospitalisation ratios (HRs; ratios between yearly numbers of varicella-related hospitalisation days prevented by MMRV and yearly numbers of FC-related hospitalisation days attributed to MMRV, both compared with MMR + V). A sensitivity analysis estimated HR under different scenarios beyond the German experience.
RESULTS: For parameter values compatible with the German experience, where MMRV (Priorix-Tetra™, GSK, Belgium) was introduced in 2006, the model predicted that transitioning from MMR + V to MMRV would induce 225 vaccine-related FC hospitalisation days whilst preventing 1976 varicella-related hospitalisation days per year. The HR estimated by Monte Carlo simulations was 8.5 (95 % confidence interval: 1.99-25.22). A sensitivity analysis on two key parameters suggested that transitioning from MMR + V to MMRV would be favourable in situations where MMRV use would significantly impact varicella vaccination uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: MMRV use instead of MMR + V can substantially reduce the number of hospitalisation days, despite increased FC risk when MMRV is used as a first dose of measles-containing vaccine.","['Bauchau V', 'Van Holle L', 'Cohen C']",2015,38,11,Drug Saf,"Bauchau V, et al.

26233075,Chickenpox in Poland in 2013.,"BACKGROUND: A large number of chickenpox cases, occurring especially in children, indicates the rationale for the use of chickenpox vaccinations. In Poland since 2002, chickenpox vaccination is included in the National Immunisation Programme as recommended.
AIM: To assess epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2013 in comparison to previous years.
METHODS: The descriptive analysis was based on data retrieved from routine mandatory surveillance system and published in the annual bulletins ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2013"" and ""Vaccinations in Poland in 2013"" (Czarkowski MP i in., Warszawa 2014, NIZP-PZH i GIS). National Immunisation Programme for year 2013 was also used.
RESULTS: In 2013, 178 501 cases of chickenpox were registered in Poland. The incidence was 463.6 and was lower than in 2012 (540.5). The highest number of cases was reported in mazowieckie voivodeship, the lowest in podlaskie voivodeship. The highest incidence was recorded in children aged 4 years (6 545.1 per 100,000). The chickenpox incidence among men (491.7) was higher by 12.4% comparing to women (437.3). The incidence among rural residents (497.2) was higher than among urban residents (441.7). Number of cases hospitalized due to mumps was 1 184. Number of people vaccinated against chickenpox was 57 168.
SUMMARY: In 2013, there was decrease in the incidence of chickenpox [corrected] in Poland with small fluctuations. Since 2002 the number of people vaccinated against chickenpox increased. The increase in the number of people vaccinated against chickenpox would help maintain the downward trend in subsequent years.","['Korczyńska MR', 'Rogalska J']",2015,69,2,Przegl Epidemiol,"Korczyńska MR and Rogalska J.

26232696,Evaluation of varicella zoster virus-specific cell-mediated immunity by using an interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"BACKGROUND: Administration of the varicella vaccine induces both varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI).
OBJECTIVE: To assess VZV-CMI, we developed an interferon γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IFN-γ ELISA) that measures the quantity of total IFN-γ in culture supernatants of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated this method by comparing the pre- and post-vaccination immune response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 30 healthy children who were administered an initial varicella vaccination at Konan Kosei hospital.
RESULTS: IFN-γ ELISA showed well-validated results; CMI was not detectable pre-immunization but became detectable post-immunization. Seroconversion was detected in 92.6% of subjects by the immune adherence hemagglutination test; however, half of the subjects did not display an increase in CMI levels. We also compared the incidence of breakthrough varicella and herpes zoster development between CMI post-positive and post-negative vaccinees at 1-2years after the last VZV vaccination. Eight subjects had a history of varicella or herpes zoster exposure post-VZV vaccination. Two of them with post-negative CMI contracted breakthrough varicella 15-16months after the last vaccination, even though they had sufficient VZV-specific antibody levels to be considered seropositive and seroprotected. Conversely, the others with post-positive CMI did not contract breakthrough varicella, despite experiencing extensive VZV exposure through casual contact with playmates and family.
CONCLUSIONS: The CMI data generated by this IFN-γ ELISA may accurately reflect real-world immune status, and CMI may be closely related to immunoprotection against breakthrough varicella development.","['Hayashida K', 'Ozaki T', 'Nishimura N', 'Gotoh K', 'Funahashi K', 'Nakane K', 'Gomi Y', 'Manabe S', 'Ishikawa T', 'Yamanishi K']",2015,426,,J Immunol Methods,"Hayashida K, et al.

26208824,Insights into the function of tegument proteins from the varicella zoster virus.,"Chickenpox (varicella) is caused by primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV), which can establish long-term latency in the host ganglion. Once reactivated, the virus can cause shingles (zoster) in the host. VZV has a typical herpesvirus virion structure consisting of an inner DNA core, a capsid, a tegument, and an outer envelope. The tegument is an amorphous layer enclosed between the nucleocapsid and the envelope, which contains a variety of proteins. However, the types and functions of VZV tegument proteins have not yet been completely determined. In this review, we describe the current knowledge on the multiple roles played by VZV tegument proteins during viral infection. Moreover, we discuss the VZV tegument protein-protein interactions and their impact on viral tissue tropism in SCID-hu mice. This will help us develop a better understanding of how the tegument proteins aid viral DNA replication, evasion of host immune response, and pathogenesis.","['Wang W', 'Cheng T', 'Zhu H', 'Xia N']",2015,58,8,Sci China Life Sci,"Wang W, et al.

26204926,Incidence and risk factors of herpes zoster among adult renal transplant recipients receiving universal antiviral prophylaxis.,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a significant cause of morbidity and complications in adult renal transplant recipients. We determined the incidence, complications and risk factors for the development of HZ after renal transplantation in a setting using universal antiviral prophylaxis.
METHODS: The medical files of all adult renal transplants, performed between 2004 and 2008, were retrospectively reviewed to assess the clinical characteristics and risk factors of HZ. Incident cases of HZ were determined and the probability of developing post-transplant HZ for all subjects was calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was applied to assess the risk factors associated with the development of HZ.
RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were eligible with a median follow up of 38 months. Twenty nine subjects (6.4%) developed HZ, the median time to onset was 18 months, only three of them (10.3%) required hospitalization, and none developed disseminated or visceral disease and death directly attributed to zoster. However, high rates of post-herpetic neuralgia (48.7%) were observed. Overall incidence was calculated at 20.6 cases per 1000 patient-years of follow-up. Following multivariate analysis, increased age ≥ 60 years old, positive pre-transplant history of varicella related disease and administration of rejection treatment conferred an increased risk of 4.00-fold (CI: 1.79-8.92), 16.00-fold (CI: 4.62-55.52), and 5.57-fold (CI: 1.56-19.84) respectively, for the development of post-transplant zoster.

26201398,Predicting the characteristics of the aetiological agent for Kawasaki disease from other paediatric infectious diseases in Japan.,"Although Kawasaki disease (KD), which was first reported in the 1960s, is assumed to be infectious, its aetiological agent(s) remains unknown. We compared the geographical distribution of the force of infection and the super-annual periodicity of KD and seven other paediatric infectious diseases in Japan. The geographical distribution of the force of infection, which was estimated as the inverse of the mean patient age, was similar in KD and other paediatric viral infections. This similarity was due to the fact that the force of infection was determined largely by the total fertility rate. This finding suggests that KD shares a transmission route, i.e. sibling-to-sibling infection, with other paediatric infections. The super-annual periodicity, which is positively associated with the sum of an infectious disease's incubation period and infectious period, was much longer for KD and exanthema subitum than other paediatric infectious diseases. The virus for exanthema subitum is known to persist across the host's lifespan, which suggests that the aetiological agent for KD may also be capable of persistent infection. Taken together, these findings suggest that the aetiological agent for KD is transmitted through close contact and persists asymptomatically in most hosts.","['Nagao Y', 'Urabe C', 'Nakamura H', 'Hatano N']",2016,144,3,Epidemiol Infect,"Nagao Y, et al.

26189668,Influence of thyroid hormone disruption on the incidence of shingles.,"The reactivation of dormant alpha-human herpesvirus (αHHV) has been attributed to various causes often referred to as stressors. However, no clinical study investigating the relationship between stressors and reactivation exists in humans at this time. Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), an important αHHV, was shown to have its gene expression and replication regulated by thyroid hormone (TH) using molecular biology approaches. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is categorized in αHHV superfamily and shares similar homology with HSV-1. We hypothesize that a history of TH imbalance may be associated with the incidence of shingles (VZV reactivation). This current pilot study, based on a hospital medical claims database, was conducted as a retrospective case-controlled investigation to determine if a putative link between TH imbalance and incidence of shingles is present. An odds ratio of 2·95 with a χ 2 value of 51·74 was calculated for the total population diagnosed with TH disruption and shingles. Further analyses indicated that African American males exhibited a much higher chance of simultaneous diagnoses. These results show that a TH imbalance history may affect VZV reactivation at different incidence rates in different races and age groups.","['Ajavon A', 'Killian D', 'Odom R', 'Figliozzi RW', 'Chen F', 'Balish M', 'Parmar J', 'Freeman R', 'Snitzer J', 'Hsia SV']",2015,143,16,Epidemiol Infect,"Ajavon A, et al.

We describe trends and characteristics of varicella outbreaks reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during 2005-2012 from 9 states.
METHODS: Data on varicella outbreaks collected by 9 state health departments were submitted to CDC using the CDC outbreak reporting worksheet. Information was collected on dates of the outbreak, outbreak setting and number of cases by outbreak; aggregate data were provided on the numbers of outbreak-related cases by age group, vaccination status and laboratory confirmation.
RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-nine outbreaks were reported from the 6 states, which provided data for each year during 2005-2012. Based on data from these 6 states, the number of outbreaks declined by 78%, decreasing from 147 in 2005 to 33 outbreaks in 2012 (P = 0.0001). There were a total of 1015 varicella outbreaks involving 13,595 cases reported by the 9 states from 2005 to 2012. The size and duration of outbreaks declined significantly over time (P < 0.001). The median size of outbreaks was 12, 9 and 7 cases and median duration of outbreaks was 38, 35 and 26 days during 2005-2006, 2007-2009 and 2010-2012, respectively. Majority of outbreaks (95%) were reported from schools, declining from 97% in 2005-2006 to 89% in 2010-2012.

26179593,Varicella infection is not associated with increasing prevalence of eczema: a U.S. population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: Chickenpox infection early in childhood has previously been shown to protect against the development of childhood eczema in line with the hygiene hypothesis. In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended routine vaccination against varicella zoster virus in the United States. Subsequently, rates of chickenpox infection have dramatically decreased in childhood.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to understand the impact of declining rates of chickenpox infection on the prevalence of eczema.
METHODS: We analysed data from 207 007 children in the 1997-2013 National Health Interview Survey. One-year prevalence of eczema and 'ever had' history of chickenpox were analysed. Associations between chickenpox infection and eczema were tested using survey-weighted logistic regression. The impact of chickenpox on trends of eczema prevalence was tested using survey logistic regression and generalized linear models.
RESULTS: Children with a history of chickenpox compared with those without chickenpox had a lower prevalence [survey-weighted logistic regression (95% confidence interval, CI)] of eczema [8·8% (8·5-9·0%) vs. 10·6% (10·4-10·8%)]. In pooled multivariate models controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, highest level of household education, insurance coverage, U.S. birthplace and family size, eczema was inversely associated with chickenpox [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI), 0·90 (0·86-0·94), P < 0·001]. The prevalence of eczema significantly increased over time (Tukey post-hoc test, P < 0·001 for comparisons of survey years 2001-13 vs. 1997-2000, 2008-13 vs. 2001-04 and 2008-13 vs. 2005-07). In multivariate generalized linear models, the odds of eczema was not associated with chickenpox in 2001-13 (P ≥ 0·06).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lower rates of chickenpox infection secondary to widespread vaccination against varicella zoster virus are not contributing to higher rates of childhood eczema in the U.S.","['Li JC', 'Silverberg JI']",2015,173,5,Br J Dermatol,Li JC and Silverberg JI.

26178993,"Simian Varicella Virus Is Present in Macrophages, Dendritic Cells, and T Cells in Lymph Nodes of Rhesus Macaques after Experimental Reactivation.","UNLABELLED: Like varicella-zoster virus (VZV), simian varicella virus (SVV) reactivates to produce zoster. In the present study, 5 rhesus macaques were inoculated intrabronchially with SVV, and 5 months later, 4 monkeys were immunosuppressed; 1 monkey was not immunosuppressed but was subjected to the stress of transportation. In 4 monkeys, a zoster rash developed 7 to 12 weeks after immunosuppression, and a rash also developed in the monkey that was not immunosuppressed. Analysis at 24 to 48 h after zoster revealed SVV antigen in the lung alveolar wall, in ganglionic neurons and nonneuronal cells, and in skin and in lymph nodes. In skin, SVV was found primarily in sweat glands. In lymph nodes, the SVV antigen colocalized mostly with macrophages, dendritic cells, and, to a lesser extent, T cells. The presence of SVV in lymph nodes, as verified by quantitative PCR detection of SVV DNA, might reflect the sequestration of virus by macrophages and dendritic cells in lymph nodes or the presentation of viral antigens to T cells to initiate an immune response against SVV, or both.
IMPORTANCE: VZV causes varicella (chickenpox), becomes latent in ganglia, and reactivates to produce zoster and multiple other serious neurological disorders. SVV in nonhuman primates has proved to be a useful model in which the pathogenesis of the virus parallels the pathogenesis of VZV in humans. Here, we show that SVV antigens are present in sweat glands in skin and in macrophages and dendritic cells in lymph nodes after SVV reactivation in monkeys, raising the possibility that macrophages and dendritic cells in lymph nodes serve as antigen-presenting cells to activate T cell responses against SVV after reactivation.","['Traina-Dorge V', 'Doyle-Meyers LA', 'Sanford R', 'Manfredo J', 'Blackmon A', 'Wellish M', 'James S', 'Alvarez X', 'Midkiff C', 'Palmer BE', 'Deharo E', 'Gilden D', 'Mahalingam R']",2015,89,19,J Virol,"Traina-Dorge V, et al.

METHODS: For fiscal years (FY) 1992-2011, we examined data on varicella and herpes zoster physician office visits, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations (including for varicella-associated skin and soft tissue infections [SSTI]), and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, among those aged <18 years. The pre-vaccine, privately-available, and vaccine program eras were FY1992-1998, FY1999-2003, and FY2004-2011, respectively. We used Poisson regressionand Kruskal-Wallis tests (all at the p<0.05 level of significance), and compared rates using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Incidence of varicella office visits declined over the study period from a high of 25.1/1,000 in FY1994 to a low of 3.2/1,000 in FY2011. ED visits and hospitalizations followed similar patterns of decreasing rates later in the study period. IRRs comparing the vaccine program versus pre-vaccine eras were 0.29 (95%CI: 0.26-0.32) for office visits, 0.29 (95%CI: 0.21-0.40) for ED visits, and 0.41 (95%CI: 0.10-1.69) for hospitalizations. Annual declines in varicella office visits were 7.7%, 9.1%, 8.4%, and 8.4% per year among children aged <1 year, 1-4 years, 5-11 years, and ≥12 years, respectively (all p<0.001). Age-specific rates of varicella-associated SSTI declined significantly among children <12 years (p<0.001) and rates of ICU admissions decreased significantly for children <1 year (p = 0.02). (p<0.001) over the study period. For children aged 5-17 years, herpes zoster office visits decreased whereas ED visits increased (both p<0.001) and there was a small, non-significant (p = 0.07), decrease in hospitalizations.
CONCLUSION: Medically-attended varicella decreased during the study period, particularly since varicella vaccine was publicly-funded. Results suggest immunization program-related changes in varicella epidemiology, including herd effects, demonstrated by reductions in varicella in program-ineligible age groups. We did not observe a consistent impact on herpes zoster.","['Wormsbecker AE', 'Wang J', 'Rosella LC', 'Kwong JC', 'Seo CY', 'Crowcroft NS', 'Deeks SL']",2015,10,7,PLoS One,"Wormsbecker AE, et al.

26175195,Plerixafor may treat intractable post-herpetic neuralgia.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chicken pox) and establishes latency in ganglia. A reactivation of latent VZV leads to herpes zoster (shingles). Herpes zoster often causes herpetic pain that can last for months or years after the rash has healed. Prolonged herpetic pain is defined as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). There is an unmet need to explore novel therapeutic approaches for intractable PHN. Postmortem studies have shown that VZV induces neuro-inflammation and damage to the ganglia and spinal cord. These pathological changes may be critical factors resulting in PHN. Accumulated evidence suggests that stem cells may alleviate neuropathic pain in animal models through immunomodulatory actions and neuronal repair. Unfortunately, exogenous stem cell transplantation has limited clinical use due to safety concerns, immune rejection, and complications. Pharmacological mobilization of endogenous bone marrow stem cells may overcome these obstacles. Plerixafor is a SDF-1/CXCR4 axis blocker which can stimulate the release of stem cells from the bone marrow into blood circulation. We propose a hypothesis that endogenous stem cells mobilized by plerixafor may relieve the symptoms of PHN. If so, it may represent a novel approach for the treatment of intractable PHN.","['Xie F', 'Li X', 'Bao M', 'Guo R', 'Zhang C', 'Wu A', 'Yue Y', 'Guan Y', 'Wang Y']",2015,85,4,Med Hypotheses,"Xie F, et al.

Consensus guidelines do not support the use of routine screening for viremia following HSCT in adults, but no such clear guidelines exist in pediatrics. In our center, routine practice was to screen patients weekly for HSV and VZV viremia until engraftment in autologous transplant patients and up to day +100 in allogeneic transplant patients. We conducted a retrospective study of over 500 patients to establish whether this screening identified any patients with HSV or VZV viremia who would not have been identified by clinical signs or symptoms. Over a 4.5-yr period, routine screening identified three cases of HSV viremia and one case of VZV viremia. Two patients had persistent, unexplained fever and two patients had skin or mucosal lesions suggestive of HSV/VZV. We conclude that routine screening for HSV and VZV viremia in pediatric HSCT patients has a very low yield and that viremia can be reliably identified by targeted testing in patients with vesicular skin lesions, oral or genital ulceration, unexplained fever, neurological symptoms, or unexplained abnormal liver transaminases.","['Patrick K', 'Ali M', 'Richardson SE', 'Gassas A', 'Egeler M', 'Krueger J', 'Lowry J', 'Allen U', 'Schechter T']",2015,19,6,Pediatr Transplant,"Patrick K, et al.

These quality tests examine the virus content in varicella vaccines via plaque assays (either the agar overlay method [AOM] or plaque staining method [PSM]), according to the procedures suggested by the Korean Reference Material for the Varicella Vaccine (KRMVV) or the manufacturer's standard in-house protocol.
AIM: To standardize the virus content tests, viral titers in the KRMVV were measured using the PSM at four participating laboratories in a collaborative study. With the aim of developing a standardized method using the KRMVV as a positive control, we compared the ability of the two test methods, AOM and PSM, to accurately and reproducibly determine the virus content of two commercial varicella vaccines.
RESULTS: The results showed that the standardized method (PSM) was more suitable for quality control analysis of the varicella vaccine.
CONCLUSION: Use of a standardized method (PSM) according to the Korean reference material will improve the reliability and objectivity of lot release testing.","['Hong J', 'Oh HJ', 'Lee N', 'Kim DK', 'Yoon HS', 'Kim YT', 'Chang S', 'Park JH', 'Chung H']",2015,12,,Virol J,"Hong J, et al.

26138999,Clinical and economic impact of various strategies for varicella immunity screening and vaccination of health care personnel.,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to patients with varicella or herpes zoster causes considerable disruption to a health care facility's operations and has a significant health and economic impact. However, practices related to screening for immunity and immunization of health care personnel (HCP) for varicella vary widely.
METHODS: A decision tree model was built to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 8 different strategies of screening and vaccinating HCP for varicella. The outcomes are presented as probability of acquiring varicella, economic impact of varicella per employee per year, and cost to prevent additional cases of varicella. Monte Carlo simulations and 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed to address the uncertainties inherent to the model. Alternative epidemiologic and technologic scenarios were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Performing a clinical screening followed by serologic testing of HCP with negative history diminished the cost impact of varicella by >99% compared with not having a program. Vaccinating HCP with negative screen cost approximately $50,000 per case of varicella prevented at the current level of U.S. population immunity, but was projected to be cost-saving at 92% or lower immunity prevalence. Improving vaccine acceptance rates and using highly sensitive assays also optimize cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: Strategies relying on screening and vaccinating HCP for varicella on employment were shown to be cost-effective for health care facilities and are consistent with current national guidelines for varicella prevention.","['Baracco GJ', 'Eisert S', 'Saavedra S', 'Hirsch P', 'Marin M', 'Ortega-Sanchez IR']",2015,43,10,Am J Infect Control,"Baracco GJ, et al.

26137788,"Surveillance of adverse events following immunization with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine: Tuscany, 2005-2012.","INTRODUCTION: Post-licensure vaccine safety studies are essential to identify uncommon events that may be difficult to assess during pre-licensure studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety of serogroup C meningococcal conjugate (MCC) vaccine in Tuscany from 2005 to 2012.
METHODS: All adverse events (AEs) to MCC vaccine notified from 2005 to 2012 were obtained from the regional health authority.
RESULTS: Following 451,570 doses administered, 110 suspected AEs were notified (mean annual reporting rate: 2.8/10,000 doses). The most frequently AE reported was fever (60%), followed by swelling at the injection site (11%) and febrile seizures (10%). Overall, 77.3% of cases were not severe, while 21.8% required hospitalization. Almost four months after the receipt of the vaccine, a one-year-old infant was diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder with disturbance of speech, but any link with the vaccinations received was refuted. Most AEs (80.9%) occurred after co-administration with other vaccines, especially with MMR or MMRV vaccines (42.7%) or the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (33.7%).
DISCUSSION: Our study confirmed the high level of safety of MCC vaccine in Tuscany: AEs proved rare and all cases had only temporary and self-resolving consequences. As usually only the most severe suspected AEs are reported, the true proportion of AEs requiring hospitalization was most probably overestimated, and it is plausible that most of these cases were in fact only temporally related.","['Levi M', 'Donzellini M', 'Varone O', 'Sala A', 'Bechini A', 'Boccalini S', 'Bonanni P']",2014,55,4,J Prev Med Hyg,"Levi M, et al.

26133048,Children with breakthrough varicella infection requiring hospitalization in Turkey (VARICOMP Study 2008-2013).,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella in previously immunized individuals, known as ""breakthrough varicella"". While the majority of breakthrough cases are mild, some may be severe, requiring hospitalization in previously healthy children or children with an underlying condition.
METHODS: This report, as a part of the prospective national pediatric varicella hospitalizations study (including 29 centers, represent 50% of pediatric population) in Turkey, is aimed to evaluate breakthrough varicella infection requiring hospitalization before the routine use of single-dose live varicella vaccine in national program from 2008 to 2013 (<10% of the pediatric age group received a single-dose vaccine).
RESULTS: In the time period, 1939 children were hospitalized due to varicella infection in Turkey; 36 children (20 boys, 16 girls, mean age 68.0+37.6 months, all received single dose live varicella vaccine) with breakthrough varicella infection. Breakthrough varicella infection might be severe in previously healthy children (61.1%) and children with immune-compromising conditions (38.9%). The time elapsed between vaccination and hospitalization was approximately 5 years, and neurological complications, mainly encephalitis and meningitis, were the most common reason for hospitalization in previously healthy children.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric breakthrough varicella requiring hospitalization have been seen in Turkey, is mainly observed in previously healthy children at 5 years after a single-dose varicella vaccine. The varicella vaccine has been implemented as part of the National Immunization Program in Turkey in 2013 (a single dose at age 12 months). Further surveillance in the same settings could evaluate the effectiveness of national immunization with single-dose varicella vaccine at 12 months of age and potential need for second dose of vaccine.","['Dinleyici EC', 'Kurugol Z', 'Kara A', 'Tezer H', 'Tas MA', 'Guler E', 'Yasa O', 'Devrim I', 'Ciftci E', 'Ozdemir H', 'Somer A', 'Ozen M', 'Sensoy G', 'Dalgic N', 'Alhan E', 'VARICOMP Study Group']",2015,33,32,Vaccine,"Dinleyici EC, et al.

26130380,Varicella paediatric hospitalisations in Belgium: a 1-year national survey.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella universal vaccination (UV) has been implemented in many countries for several years. Nevertheless, varicella UV remains debated in Europe and few data are available on the real burden of infection. We assessed the burden of varicella in Belgium through analysis of hospitalised cases during a 1-year period.
METHODS: Data on children admitted to hospital with varicella were collected through a national network from November 2011 to October 2012. Inclusion criteria were either acute varicella or related complications up to 3 weeks after the rash.
RESULTS: Participation of 101 hospitals was obtained, covering 97.7% of the total paediatric beds in Belgium. 552 children were included with a median age of 2.1 years. Incidence of paediatric varicella hospitalisations reached 29.5/10(5) person-years, with the highest impact among those 0-4 years old (global incidence and odds of hospitalisation: 79/10(5) person-years and 1.6/100 varicella cases, respectively). Only 14% (79/552) of the cohort had an underlying chronic condition. 65% (357/552) of children had ≥1 complication justifying their admission, 49% were bacterial superinfections and 10% neurological disorders. Only a quarter of children (141/552) received acyclovir. Incidence of complicated hospitalised cases was 19/10(5) person-years. Paediatric intensive care unit admission and surgery were required in 4% and 3% of hospitalised cases, respectively. Mortality among Belgian paediatric population was 0.5/10(6) and fatality ratio 0.2% among our cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella demonstrated a substantial burden of disease in Belgian children, especially among the youngest.

26114827,Management and Prevention of Herpes Zoster Ocular Disease.,"Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) in people who have had chicken pox, usually resulting in a painful, unilateral, dermatomal, vesicular rash. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus occurs when the first division of cranial nerve V is involved. HZ is common, with approximately 1 million new cases per year in the United States, and occurs in 1 in 3 persons. Although the rate of HZ increases with age, over half of all cases occur under the age of 60 years. Complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus include eye disease, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and strokes. VZV has also been found in temporal arteritis biopsies. There is growing evidence that HZ is followed by chronic active VZV infection contributing to these complications. In view of this, and the efficacy of suppressive antiviral treatment in reducing recurrent herpes simplex keratitis, a randomized controlled trial of suppressive valacyclovir to reduce new or worsening anterior segment disease and/or PHN is needed. The zoster vaccine (ZV) is safe and effective in reducing the burden of illness, severity of PHN, and incidence of HZ. It is Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended for persons aged 60 years and above without impaired cellular immunity, and Food and Drug Administration approved for those aged 50 and older. It is most effective in preventing HZ in recipients in their 50s. Because of underusage of the ZV, it has not impacted the epidemiology of the disease.

26105052,Sialic Acids on Varicella-Zoster Virus Glycoprotein B Are Required for Cell-Cell Fusion.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the human Herpesvirus family that causes varicella (chicken pox) and zoster (shingles). VZV latently infects sensory ganglia and is also responsible for encephalomyelitis. Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a member of the sialic acid (SA)-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin family, is mainly expressed in neural tissues. VZV glycoprotein B (gB) associates with MAG and mediates membrane fusion during VZV entry into host cells. The SA requirements of MAG when associating with its ligands vary depending on the specific ligand, but it is unclear whether the SAs on gB are involved in the association with MAG. In this study, we found that SAs on gB are essential for the association with MAG as well as for membrane fusion during VZV infection. MAG with a point mutation in the SA-binding site did not bind to gB and did not mediate cell-cell fusion or VZV entry. Cell-cell fusion and VZV entry mediated by the gB-MAG interaction were blocked by sialidase treatment. N-glycosylation or O-glycosylation inhibitors also inhibited the fusion and entry mediated by gB-MAG interaction. Furthermore, gB with mutations in N-glycosylation sites, i.e. asparagine residues 557 and 686, did not associate with MAG, and the cell-cell fusion efficiency was low. Fusion between the viral envelope and cellular membrane is essential for host cell entry by herpesviruses. Therefore, these results suggest that SAs on gB play important roles in MAG-mediated VZV infection.","['Suenaga T', 'Matsumoto M', 'Arisawa F', 'Kohyama M', 'Hirayasu K', 'Mori Y', 'Arase H']",2015,290,32,J Biol Chem,"Suenaga T, et al.

26090802,Neuronal Subtype and Satellite Cell Tropism Are Determinants of Varicella-Zoster Virus Virulence in Human Dorsal Root Ganglia Xenografts In Vivo.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV), a human alphaherpesvirus, causes varicella during primary infection. VZV reactivation from neuronal latency may cause herpes zoster, post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and other neurologic syndromes. To investigate VZV neuropathogenesis, we developed a model using human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) xenografts in immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The SCID DRG model provides an opportunity to examine characteristics of VZV infection that occur in the context of the specialized architecture of DRG, in which nerve cell bodies are ensheathed by satellite glial cells (SGC) which support neuronal homeostasis. We hypothesized that VZV exhibits neuron-subtype specific tropism and that VZV tropism for SGC contributes to VZV-related ganglionopathy. Based on quantitative analyses of viral and cell protein expression in DRG tissue sections, we demonstrated that, whereas DRG neurons had an immature neuronal phenotype prior to implantation, subtype heterogeneity was observed within 20 weeks and SGC retained the capacity to maintain neuronal homeostasis longterm. Profiling VZV protein expression in DRG neurons showed that VZV enters peripherin+ nociceptive and RT97+ mechanoreceptive neurons by both axonal transport and contiguous spread from SGC, but replication in RT97+ neurons is blocked. Restriction occurs even when the SGC surrounding the neuronal cell body were infected and after entry and ORF61 expression, but before IE62 or IE63 protein expression. Notably, although contiguous VZV spread with loss of SGC support would be predicted to affect survival of both nociceptive and mechanoreceptive neurons, RT97+ neurons showed selective loss relative to peripherin+ neurons at later times in DRG infection. Profiling cell factors that were upregulated in VZV-infected DRG indicated that VZV infection induced marked pro-inflammatory responses, as well as proteins of the interferon pathway and neuroprotective responses. These neuropathologic changes observed in sensory ganglia infected with VZV may help to explain the neurologic sequelae often associated with zoster and PHN.","['Zerboni L', 'Arvin A']",2015,11,6,PLoS Pathog,Zerboni L and Arvin A.

26085158,The ORF61 Protein Encoded by Simian Varicella Virus and Varicella-Zoster Virus Inhibits NF-κB Signaling by Interfering with IκBα Degradation.,"UNLABELLED: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox upon primary infection and establishes latency in ganglia. Reactivation from latency causes herpes zoster, which may be complicated by postherpetic neuralgia. Innate immunity mediated by interferon and proinflammatory cytokines represents the first line of immune defense upon infection and reactivation. VZV is known to interfere with multiple innate immune signaling pathways, including the central transcription factor NF-κB. However, the role of these inhibitory mechanisms in vivo is unknown. Simian varicella virus (SVV) infection of rhesus macaques recapitulates key aspects of VZV pathogenesis, and this model thus permits examination of the role of immune evasion mechanisms in vivo. Here, we compare SVV and VZV with respect to interference with NF-κB activation. We demonstrate that both viruses prevent ubiquitination of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, whereas SVV additionally prevents IκBα phosphorylation. We show that the ORF61 proteins of VZV and SVV are sufficient to prevent IκBα ubiquitination upon ectopic expression. We further demonstrate that SVV ORF61 interacts with β-TrCP, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the degradation of IκBα. This interaction seems to inactivate SCF-mediated protein degradation in general, since the unrelated β-TrCP target Snail is also stabilized by ORF61. In addition to ORF61, SVV seems to encode additional inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway, since SVV with ORF61 deleted still prevented IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that SVV interferes with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB activation at multiple levels, which is consistent with the importance of these countermechanisms for varicella virus infection.
IMPORTANCE: The role of innate immunity during the establishment of primary infection, latency, and reactivation by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is incompletely understood. Since infection of rhesus macaques by simian varicella virus (SVV) is used as an animal model of VZV infection, we characterized the molecular mechanism by which SVV interferes with innate immune activation. Specifically, we studied how SVV prevents activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, a central factor in eliciting proinflammatory responses. The identification of molecular mechanisms that counteract innate immunity might ultimately lead to better vaccines and treatments for VZV, since overcoming these mechanisms, either by small-molecule inhibition or by genetic modification of vaccine strains, is expected to reduce the pathogenic potential of VZV. Moreover, using SVV infection of rhesus macaques, it will be possible to study how increasing the vulnerability of varicella viruses to innate immunity will impact viral pathogenesis.","['Whitmer T', 'Malouli D', 'Uebelhoer LS', 'DeFilippis VR', 'Früh K', 'Verweij MC']",2015,89,17,J Virol,"Whitmer T, et al.

26083834,"Pilot study of antibodies against varicella zoster virus and human immunodeficiency virus in relation to the risk of developing stroke, nested within a rural cohort in Uganda.","OBJECTIVE: The risk of stroke rises after episodes of herpes zoster and chickenpox, which are caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV). We conducted a pilot case-control study of stroke, nested within a long-standing cohort in Uganda (the General Population Cohort), to examine antibodies against VZV prior to diagnosis.
METHODS: We used stored sera to examine the evolution of IgG and IgM antibodies against VZV among 31 clinically confirmed cases of stroke and 132 matched controls. For each participant, three samples of sera were identified: one each, taken at or near the time of (pseudo)diagnosis, between 5 and 10 years prior to diagnosis and at 15 years prior to diagnosis.
RESULTS: All participants had detectable antibodies against VZV, but there were no significant differences between cases and controls in the 15 years prior to diagnosis. As a secondary finding, 16% (5/31) of cases and 6% (8/132) of controls had HIV (OR 3.0; 95% CI 0.8-10.1; P = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study to examine a biological measure of exposure to VZV prior to diagnosis of stroke and although we identified no significant association, in this small pilot, with limited characterisation of cases, we cannot exclude the possibility that the virus is causal for a subset. The impact of HIV on risk of stroke has not been well characterised and warrants further study.","['Asiki G', 'Stockdale L', 'Kasamba I', 'Vudriko T', 'Tumwekwase G', 'Johnston T', 'Kaleebu P', 'Kamali A', 'Seeley J', 'Newton R']",2015,20,10,Trop Med Int Health,"Asiki G, et al.

26081644,Successful rescue of disseminated varicella infection with multiple organ failure in a pediatric living donor liver transplant recipient: a case report and literature review.,"A 12-year-old female patient with biliary atresia underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Twelve months after the LDLT, she developed acute hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase 584 IU/L) and was diagnosed with disseminated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection with high level of serum VZV-DNA (1.5 × 10(5) copies/mL) and generalized vesicular rash. She had received the VZV vaccination when she was 5-years-old and had not been exposed to chicken pox before the LDLT, and her serum was positive for VZV immunoglobulin G at the time of the LDLT. Although she underwent treatment with intravenous acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin, and withdrawal of immunosuppressants, her symptoms worsened and were accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia, and encephalitis.

26073188,"Varicella-zoster virus infections of the central nervous system – Prognosis, diagnostics and treatment.","Both varicella and herpes zoster that are caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), are associated with central nervous system disease. Since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction, the opportunity to detect the virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has improved dramatically. As a result VZV is diagnosed as one of the most common viruses causing CNS disease and it has become evident that this disease includes a wide spectrum of different CNS manifestations. The most evaluated CNS manifestations are encephalitis which is associated with both varicella and herpes zoster and, cerebellitis which occurs predominantly in children with varicella. Other manifestations have been less widely investigated. The incidence of cerebrovascular disease caused by VZV has been only scarcely studied and, in addition, some data indicate that vasculitis might also be involved in other VZV CNS manifestations such as herpes zoster-associated encephalitis. For this reason, VZV CNS infection must be suspected in several CNS syndromes and diagnostics should be based on CSF analysis for detection of VZV DNA by PCR and/or intrathecal antibody production. The prognosis is reported as favourable in children but few follow-up studies are available. Moreover, in adults, the prognosis is reported to be good in overall terms, but later studies indicate more serious neurological sequelae including cognition. Despite considerable mortality and morbidity, so far also in vaccinating countries, few treatment studies are available. Further treatment studies including assessments of neurological and cognitive sequelae, are warranted.","['Grahn A', 'Studahl M']",2015,71,3,J Infect,"Grahn A and Studahl M.

26072679,Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Expression Induced by Varicella-Zoster Virus Infection Results in the Modulation of Virus Replication.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an important viral pathogen that is responsible for causing varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). VZV has been shown to suppress early anti-viral innate immune responses, but the exact mechanisms are not yet well understood. Here we demonstrate that host control of VZV is impaired by the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3. We used three different cell types to characterize VZV-induced anti-viral and inflammatory responses. Infection of human fibroblasts (MRC-5) and human macrophages (THP-1) with VZV triggered upregulation of anti-viral responsive gene expression (IFN-α, IFN-β) in the early phases of infection, followed by the waning of these IFNs in the late phases of infection. Conversely, VZV infection in keratinocytes (HaCaT) resulted in a persistent increase in type I IFN gene expression. Interestingly, increase in SOCS1 and 3 expressions coincided with a reduction in phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT3) in VZV-infected MRC-5 cells. Furthermore, VZV infection increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, -8, and IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10). Knockdown of SOCS3 inhibited viral replication and enhanced secretion levels of IL-6, whereas overexpression of SOCS3 did not affect viral replication efficiency and host response. In conclusion, our data suggest that VZV infection induces SOCS3 expression, resulting in modulation of type I IFN signaling and viral replication.","['Choi EJ', 'Lee CH', 'Shin OS']",2015,82,4,Scand J Immunol,"Choi EJ, et al.

26072038,Outbreak of varicella in a highly vaccinated preschool population.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella vaccine is available for private purchase in Beijing, with single dose recommended for children aged ≥12 months before 2013. Despite the success achieved in reducing varicella incidence, varicella outbreaks continued to occur, including in schools and kindergartens among highly vaccinated children. We investigated a varicella outbreak in a preschool with high varicella vaccination coverage in Haidian district, Beijing.
METHODS: Through questionnaires, data including children's medical and vaccination history were collected from their parents. A case of varicella was defined as an acute, generalized, maculopapulovesicular rash without other apparent cause in a child in the preschool from March 10 through March 29, 2010. Attack rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated children were calculated, and the analyses of vaccine effectiveness (VE) and of risk factors for breakthrough disease (varicella occurring >42 days after vaccination) were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 12 cases occurred during the outbreak, and ten of them (83.3%) had breakthrough varicella. The index case with mild varicella occurred in a child who had been vaccinated four years previously. Questionnaires were returned for all of 150 children in the preschool. Of all the 150 children, 144 (96.0%) had no prior history of varicella disease. Among these children, 135(93.7%) had received single-dose varicella vaccine before the outbreak. VE was 84.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 62.8%∼93.5%] in preventing varicella of any severity, and VE was 92.2% (95% CI: 81.4%∼96.8%) against moderate to severe varicella. Age at vaccination (<15 months vs. ≥15 months) and time since vaccination before the outbreak (<3 years vs. ≥3 years) were not associated with the increased risk of breakthrough varicella(P=0.124 and 1, respectively). All the varicella cases with vaccination history verified through immunization records had received varicella vaccine and measles-mumps-rubella vaccine >30 days apart.
CONCLUSIONS: Breakthrough infection with fever in vaccinated person may be as infectious as varicella in unvaccinated persons. High single-dose varicella vaccination coverage is effective in reducing varicella incidence, but not sufficient to prevent outbreak. To control varicella outbreak a second dose may deserve additional consideration.","['Fu J', 'Wang J', 'Jiang C', 'Shi R', 'Ma T']",2015,37,,Int J Infect Dis,"Fu J, et al.

26063085,Australian vaccine preventable disease epidemiological review series: measles 2000-2011.,"BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of measles vaccine to the vaccination schedule, the burden of measles has substantially fallen in Australia. Despite this, a number of recent measles outbreaks have occurred. The aim of this study was to examine the burden of measles in Australia using notification, hospitalisation and mortality data with the objectives of setting a baseline for comparison prior to the introduction of the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, the National Hospital Morbidity Database and the National Mortality Database to obtain notification, hospitalisation and death data, respectively from 2000 to 2011. Rates were calculated and compared over time by age group and jurisdiction.
RESULTS: Since 1993, measles notifications have fallen considerably in Australia. However, between 2000 and 2011, measles notification rates and hospitalisation rates fluctuated. Between 2000 and 2011, there were 990 measles notifications in Australia. The average annual notification rate was 0.4 per 100,000 population. Children aged 0-4 years were the most susceptible group, particularly infants less than 1 year of age (average annual rate, 1.6 per 100,000 population). High incidence was also observed in adolescents (average annual rate, 0.7 per 100,000 population) and young adults (average annual rate, 0.8 per 100,000 population). Jurisdictional variation occurred with differing patterns of notifications and hospitalisations.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a marked reduction in measles notifications and hospitalisations has occurred in the past decade, susceptible individuals should be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks and to maintain a low incidence of measles and Australia's elimination status.","['Chiew M', 'Dey A', 'Martin N', 'Wang H', 'Davis S', 'McIntyre PB']",2015,39,1,Commun Dis Intell Q Rep,"Chiew M, et al.

26062824,Environmental factors in the development of narcolepsy with cataplexy. A case-control study.,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological studies suggest the importance of environmental factors in the etiology of narcolepsy-cataplexy in genetically predisposed subjects.
AIM: To assess the role of environmental factors in the development of narcolepsy-cataplexy, using a case-control design with control subjects being matched for ethnicity and age.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were recruited through two outpatient clinics at the community of Madrid, ant the diagnosis of narcolepsy fulfilled the criteria of the International Classification on Sleep Disorders-2005. A questionnaire, including 54 environmental psychological stressor life events and 42 infectious diseases items, was administered to 54 patients. We specifically assessed the stressful factors and infectious diseases that occurred in the year preceding the onset of the first symptom of narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness and/or cataplexy). The same questionnaire was administered to 84 control subjects recruited from non-related family members of the same community.
RESULTS: Fifty four patients (55.6% males) answered the questionnaire, The mean age at onset of the first symptom was 21.6 ± 9.3 years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 36.5 ± 12.4 years. The main finding in narcoleptic patients as compared to control subjects was major changes in the 'number of arguments with partner, family, or friends' (odds ratio: 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.8-14.5). This can be interpreted as having a protective function and it suggests that psychological mechanisms are present since the beginning of the disease. As for the infectious factors, chickenpox was the most frequently reported. No significant differences were found in terms of total numbers of stress-related and infectious factors between cases and controls.
CONCLUSION: Prospective studies regarding the interaction between environmental and genetic factors are warranted.","['Peraita-Adrados R', 'del Rio-Villegas R', 'Vela-Bueno A']",2015,60,12,Rev Neurol,"Peraita-Adrados R, et al.

First, we evaluated the existence of clusters and spatio-temporal interaction; secondly, we used this information to find the locations of the spatio-temporal clusters via the space-time permutation model. The first method used detects any aggregation in our data but does not provide the spatial and temporal information. The second method gives the locations, areas and time-frame for the spatio-temporal clusters.

METHODS: In this study of 649 solid organ transplant recipients, followed prospectively for infectious disease events within the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study, we were interested to see if KIR genotype associated with virus infections other than CMV.
RESULT: We found that KIR B haplotypes (which have previously been linked to protection from CMV replication) were associated with protection from varicella zoster virus infection (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.91; P = 0.03). No significant associations were detected regarding the risk of herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr virus or BK polyomavirus infections.

26045284,Association rule mining in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).,"PURPOSE: Spontaneous adverse event reporting systems are critical tools for monitoring the safety of licensed medical products. Commonly used signal detection algorithms identify disproportionate product-adverse event pairs and may not be sensitive to more complex potential signals. We sought to develop a computationally tractable multivariate data-mining approach to identify product-multiple adverse event associations.
METHODS: We describe an application of stepwise association rule mining (Step-ARM) to detect potential vaccine-symptom group associations in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Step-ARM identifies strong associations between one vaccine and one or more adverse events. To reduce the number of redundant association rules found by Step-ARM, we also propose a clustering method for the post-processing of association rules.
RESULTS: In sample applications to a trivalent intradermal inactivated influenza virus vaccine and to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine and in simulation studies, we find that Step-ARM can detect a variety of medically coherent potential vaccine-symptom group signals efficiently. In the MMRV example, Step-ARM appears to outperform univariate methods in detecting a known safety signal.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach is sensitive to potentially complex signals, which may be particularly important when monitoring novel medical countermeasure products such as pandemic influenza vaccines. The post-processing clustering algorithm improves the applicability of the approach as a screening method to identify patterns that may merit further investigation.","['Wei L', 'Scott J']",2015,24,9,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Wei L and Scott J.

26041469,Systematic review of models assessing the economic value of routine varicella and herpes zoster vaccination in high-income countries.,"BACKGROUND: A systematic review was conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of routine varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination in high-income countries estimated by modelling studies.
METHODS: A PubMed search was performed to identify relevant studies published before October 2013. Studies were included in the review if they (i) evaluated the cost-effectiveness of routine childhood or adolescent varicella vaccination and/or HZ vaccination targeting the elderly, and if they (ii) reported results for high-income countries.
RESULTS: A total of 38 model-based studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Routine childhood or adolescent varicella vaccination was cost-effective or cost-saving from a payer perspective and always cost-saving from a societal perspective when ignoring its potential impact on HZ incidence due to reduced or absent exogenous boosting. The inclusion of the potential impact of childhood varicella vaccination on HZ led to net quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses or incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding commonly accepted thresholds. Additional HZ vaccination could partially mitigate this effect. Studies focusing only on the evaluation of HZ vaccination reported a wide range of results depending on the selected target age-group and the vaccine price, but most found HZ vaccination to be a cost-effective or marginally cost-effective intervention. Cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination was strongly dependent on the age at vaccination, the price of the vaccine, the assumed duration of protection and the applied cost per QALY threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: While HZ vaccination is mostly considered cost-effective, cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination primarily depends on the in- or exclusion of exogenous boosting in the model. As a consequence, clarification on the role of exogenous boosting is crucial for decision-making regarding varicella vaccination.","['Damm O', 'Ultsch B', 'Horn J', 'Mikolajczyk RT', 'Greiner W', 'Wichmann O']",2015,15,,BMC Public Health,"Damm O, et al.

26041441,Prospective surveillance of hospitalisations associated with varicella in New Zealand children.,"AIM: Varicella is a vaccine-preventable disease not notifiable in New Zealand (NZ), and varicella vaccine is not funded in the National Immunisation Schedule (NIS). Hospitalisations can occur because of bacterial secondary infection and other complications, which can result in long-term sequelae. Varicella may not be acknowledged in discharge coding when complications occur weeks after infection. Using the New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit (NZPSU), the aim of this study was to document the hospitalisation burden of this disease.
METHODS: Cases (0-14 years) of varicella and post-varicella complications requiring hospitalisation, including stroke syndromes where varicella occurred in the preceding 6 months, were notified to NZPSU between 1 November 2011 and 31 October 2013. Herpes zoster cases were excluded. Questionnaires were used to capture demographics, clinical features, management and short-term outcomes.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight notifications were received and 144 were confirmed cases. Overall incidence was 8.3/100,000 children per year. Fifty-two percent were women with a median age of 2.4 years. Māori and Pacific Island (PI) children accounted for 74% of hospitalisations, with incidence rate ratios compared with European children of 2.8 and 3.9, respectively (P < 0.01). Complications included: infection (75%), respiratory (11%), neurological (11%), electrolyte disturbance (6%) and haemorrhagic varicella (4%). Nine percent were immunocompromised. Median duration of hospital admission was 4 days with 9% requiring intensive care admission. There were no reported deaths; however, 19% had ongoing problems at discharge.
CONCLUSION: Varicella has more associated morbidity than commonly perceived in immunocompetent children. Māori and PI children are more likely to have complications.

Varicella is a highly-contagious disease, with attack rates of up to 90% among susceptible individuals. In closed communities, the implementation of outbreak control measures is critical.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of children exposed to varicella at CG, the implemented prophylaxis measures and their effectiveness.
METHODS: Prospective, cohort study. Children exposed to varicella at CG between2008 and 2013, their demographic and clinical characteristics, immunization and/or history of varicella, prophylaxis measures, and secondary attack rate were assessed.
RESULTS: N: 107. Fifty-three percent (n: 57) were girls. Their median age was 84 months old [interquartile range (IQR): 24-144]. Ninety-five percent (n: 102) had an underlying disease [hemato-oncological disease: 39% (n: 42); neurological disease: 18% (n: 19); congenital heart disease: 9% (n: 10); and post-operative period: 65 (n: 6)]. Fifty percent had some degree of immunosuppression (n: 54). Twenty-nine percent (n: 31) referred to have had varicella; 27% (n: 29) indicated that they never had the infection; and 41% (n: 44) did not recall a history of varicella.

25981883,Dangers of vaccine refusal near the herd immunity threshold: a modelling study.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood vaccination remains the focus of heated public debate. Parents struggle to understand the potential risks associated with vaccination but both parents and physicians assume that they understand the risks associated with infection. This study was done to characterise how modern vaccination practices have altered patient risks from infection.
METHODS: In this modelling study, we use mathematical analysis to explore how modern-era vaccination practices have changed the risks of severe outcomes for some infections by changing the landscape for disease transmission. We show these effects using published data from outbreaks in the USA for measles, chickenpox, and rubella. Calculation of risk estimation was the main outcome of this study.
FINDINGS: Our calculations show that negative outcomes are 4·5 times worse for measles, 2·2 times worse for chickenpox, and 5·8 times worse for rubella than would be expected in a pre-vaccine era in which the average age at infection would have been lower.
INTERPRETATION: As vaccination makes preventable illness rarer, for some diseases, it also increases the expected severity of each case. Because estimates of case risks rely on data for severity generated during a pre-vaccine era they underestimate negative outcomes in the modern post-vaccine epidemiological landscape. Physicians and parents should understand when making decisions about their children's health and safety that remaining unvaccinated in a predominantly vaccine-protected community exposes their children to the most severe possible outcomes for many preventable diseases.

25979278,The social contact hypothesis under the assumption of endemic equilibrium: Elucidating the transmission potential of VZV in Europe.,"The basic reproduction number R0 and the effective reproduction number R are pivotal parameters in infectious disease epidemiology, quantifying the transmission potential of an infection in a population. We estimate both parameters from 13 pre-vaccination serological data sets on varicella zoster virus (VZV) in 12 European countries and from population-based social contact surveys under the commonly made assumptions of endemic and demographic equilibrium. The fit to the serology is evaluated using the inferred effective reproduction number R as a model eligibility criterion combined with AIC as a model selection criterion. For only 2 out of 12 countries, the common choice of a constant proportionality factor is sufficient to provide a good fit to the seroprevalence data. For the other countries, an age-specific proportionality factor provides a better fit, assuming physical contacts lasting longer than 15 min are a good proxy for potential varicella transmission events. In all countries, primary infection with VZV most often occurs in early childhood, but there is substantial variation in transmission potential with R0 ranging from 2.8 in England and Wales to 7.6 in The Netherlands. Two non-parametric methods, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) and a random forest approach, are used to explain these differences in R0 in terms of relevant country-specific characteristics. Our results suggest an association with three general factors: inequality in wealth, infant vaccination coverage and child care attendance. This illustrates the need to consider fundamental differences between European countries when formulating and parameterizing infectious disease models.","['Santermans E', 'Goeyvaerts N', 'Melegaro A', 'Edmunds WJ', 'Faes C', 'Aerts M', 'Beutels P', 'Hens N']",2015,11,,Epidemics,"Santermans E, et al.

25970524,Clinical benefits of routine varicella vaccination for adults.,"Varicella is a highly contagious disease caused by varicella zoster virus. In children, it is generally a mild to moderate illness while it is often more severe in adults, with serious complications as dehydration, pneumonia, bleeding problems, infection or inflammation of the brain, secondary bacterial infections, sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, bone infections, joint infections and deaths. Some groups of adults are at major risk of complications, in particular immunocompromised persons as subjects with impaired humoral immunity and who is receiving systemic steroids, persons who live or work in environments in which transmission of varicella is likely, health-care personnel and pregnant women. After the introduction of Universal Mass Vaccination (UMV), the first mathematical models suggested that vaccination will lead to a shift in the average age at infection from children to adults with an increasing numbers of complicated forms, nevertheless new models predicted that, although an upward shift in the age at infection may occur, the overall morbidity due to varicella is likely to decrease. Current literature seems to suggest that for public health authorities the key action to prevent an increase of varicella incidence among adults is to achieve high vaccination coverage among babies and adolescents in countries who adopted UMV.","['Germinario C', 'Gallone MS', 'Cappelli MG', 'Tafuri S']",2015,11,6,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Germinario C, et al.

25964168,"Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of zoster vaccine in subjects on chronic/maintenance corticosteroids.","BACKGROUND: This randomized, placebo-controlled study assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of live virus zoster vaccine (ZV) in individuals receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid therapy (daily dose equivalent of 5-20mg prednisone) for ≥2 weeks prior to vaccination and ≥6 weeks postvaccination.
METHODS: Subjects were followed for adverse experiences (AEs), exposure to varicella or herpes zoster (HZ), or development of varicella/varicella-like or HZ/HZ-like rashes for 42 days postvaccination (primary safety follow-up period) and for serious AEs (SAEs) through Day 182 postvaccination (secondary follow-up period). Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody titers by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) were measured at baseline and at Week 6 postvaccination.
RESULTS: The proportions of subjects reporting systemic AEs and SAEs were similar in both groups. A higher percentage of subjects reported injection-site AEs in the ZV group (21.5%) than in the placebo group (12.1%). One SAE of ophthalmic HZ (onset Day 16 postvaccination) was reported in the ZV group and deemed vaccine-related by the study investigator; however, PCR testing confirmed the presence of wild-type (not vaccine strain) VZV. Geometric mean titer (GMT) at 6 weeks postvaccination was higher for ZV recipients than placebo recipients, with estimated geometric mean fold rises (GMFR) of 2.3 (CI: 2.0, 2.7) and 1.1 (CI: 1.0, 1.2) respectfully.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults ≥60 years old on chronic/maintenance corticosteroids, ZV was generally well tolerated and immunogenic. The VZV-specific gpELISA antibody GMT at 6 weeks postvaccination and the GMFR from baseline to 6 weeks postvaccination were higher in the ZV group than in the placebo group.","['Russell AF', 'Parrino J', 'Fisher CL', 'Spieler W', 'Stek JE', 'Coll KE', 'Su SC', 'Xu J', 'Li X', 'Schlienger K', 'Silber JL']",2015,33,27,Vaccine,"Russell AF, et al.

25926648,Recombination of Globally Circulating Varicella-Zoster Virus.,"UNLABELLED: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpesvirus, which during primary infection typically causes varicella (chicken pox) and establishes lifelong latency in sensory and autonomic ganglia. Later in life, the virus may reactivate to cause herpes zoster (HZ; also known as shingles). To prevent these diseases, a live-attenuated heterogeneous vaccine preparation, vOka, is used routinely in many countries worldwide. Recent studies of another alphaherpes virus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, demonstrate that live-attenuated vaccine strains can recombine in vivo, creating virulent progeny. These findings raised concerns about using attenuated herpesvirus vaccines under conditions that favor recombination. To investigate whether VZV may undergo recombination, which is a prerequisite for VZV vaccination to create such conditions, we here analyzed 115 complete VZV genomes. Our results demonstrate that recombination occurs frequently for VZV. It thus seems that VZV is fully capable of recombination if given the opportunity, which may have important implications for continued VZV vaccination. Although no interclade vaccine wild-type recombinant strains were found, intraclade recombinants were frequently detected in clade 2, which harbors the vaccine strains, suggesting that the vaccine strains have already been involved in recombination events, either in vivo or in vitro during passages in cell culture. Finally, previous partial and complete genomic studies have described strains that do not cluster phylogenetically to any of the five established clades. The additional VZV strains sequenced here, in combination with those previously published, have enabled us to formally define a novel sixth VZV clade.
IMPORTANCE: Although genetic recombination has been demonstrated to frequently occur for other human alphaherpesviruses, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, only a few ancient and isolated recent recombination events have hitherto been demonstrated for VZV. In the present study, we demonstrate that VZV also frequently undergoes genetic recombination, including strains belonging to the clade containing the vOKA strain.","['Norberg P', 'Depledge DP', 'Kundu S', 'Atkinson C', 'Brown J', 'Haque T', 'Hussaini Y', 'MacMahon E', 'Molyneaux P', 'Papaevangelou V', 'Sengupta N', 'Koay ES', 'Tang JW', 'Underhill GS', 'Grahn A', 'Studahl M', 'Breuer J', 'Bergström T']",2015,89,14,J Virol,"Norberg P, et al.

25917799,Varicella zoster virus immunity: A primer.,"Varicella zoster (VZV) is among the most prevalent viruses affecting the human race. The majority of us experience primary infection as varicella in childhood and remain latently infected, with occasional reactivation as the infectious entity, shingles. Rarely, VZV causes severe and disseminated disease, which can be fatal despite the availability of highly active antiviral agents. VZV is the only herpesvirus against which effective vaccines have been developed and widely implemented in several countries, further complicating its epidemiology. The immunological correlates of protection against varicella remain incompletely understood. Here we provide a brief overview of evidence from animal models and observational studies that define immunologic risk factors for severe varicella, and thus the most important elements of VZV immunity. Although circulating VZV-specific antibody can prevent primary infection, innate and cellular responses appear much more important in limiting its severity and duration. Improved understanding of these protective factors may assist us in developing more effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of severe varicella.","['Duncan CJ', 'Hambleton S']",2015,71 Suppl 1,,J Infect,Duncan CJ and Hambleton S.

25916861,Increased large unstained cells value in varicella patients: A valuable parameter to aid rapid diagnosis of varicella infection.,"Varicella is a highly contagious infection caused by varicella zoster virus. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate between other viral infections such as Kaposi's varicelliform eruption (KVE) and disseminated herpes zoster (HZ). The large unstained cells (LUC) value is a differential count parameter reported by routing hematology analysis. LUC have been studied previously, but never been reported in the context of varicella or in dermatological published work. The aim of this study was to compare the LUC values in varicella patients with that in KVE and disseminated HZ patients. Sixty-nine varicella patients, 30 KVE patients and 11 disseminated HZ patients were included in this retrospective study. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 or GraphPad Prism version 5.0. The mean percentage of LUC (%LUC) in varicella patients was higher than the upper limit of normal reference range and it was increased compared to %LUC of both KVE (P < 0.0001) and disseminated HZ (P = 0.0051) patients. %LUC of varicella patients significantly decreased with clinical improvements (P = 0.0017). %LUC was significantly increased in varicella patients and corresponded with clinical improvements. Patients with %LUC of 3.55 or more favor the diagnosis of varicella over both KVE and disseminated HZ with 71.01% sensitivity and 84.44% specificity. We suggest that %LUC can assist in making a precise diagnosis of varicella in confusing cases.","['Shin D', 'Lee MS', 'Kim DY', 'Lee MG', 'Kim DS']",2015,42,8,J Dermatol,"Shin D, et al.

25914731,The clinical and epidemiological evolution of varicella in Romania during 2004 and 2013.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella, a vaccine preventable disease (VPD) is one of the most common communicable diseases in Romania. The objectives of our study were to describe the epidemiological evolution of varicella in Romania between 2004 and 2013 and the clinical characteristics of the cases admitted to NIID between 2011 and 2013.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An epidemiological retrospective study was conducted by using the information reported quarterly by general practitioners and hospitals at the national level. There is no system for the surveillance of severe cases in Romania, so, to describe the clinical characteristics of varicella cases, a second retrospective study was developed, in which the patients hospitalized in the NIID, within the period 2011-2013, were included. Questionnaires were completed by using data from the clinical observation forms. Collected information included demographic, clinical and laboratory data, complications, date of onset and admission, length of stay, admission and discharge diagnosis. Data were processed and analyzed by using Microsoft Excel program.
RESULTS: A total of 504,844 cases were reported of at the national level between 2004 and 2013, with a mean incidence of 238.2/ 100,000 inhabitants. The most affected age group was 5-9 years old (incidence 1362.7/ 100,000 inhabitants). The study conducted in NIID, registered 353 patients hospitalized with varicella between 2011 and 2013. Most of the hospitalized cases (88.8%) were under 10 years old and many (72.6 %) attended a community. The majority of cases had rash (98.6%) and fever (79.9%). The main complications were pneumonia (46.2%), bacterial infection (16.1%) and encephalitis (2.5%).
DISCUSSIONS: Varicella is a very common disease in Romania, which may develop complications. A specific surveillance system should be introduced in order to provide accurate epidemiological, clinical and laboratory information to assess whether varicella is a public health problem in Romania and if the introduction of vaccination in NIP is recommended. However, given the large number of current cases in Romania, a solution may be a sentinel surveillance system type.","['Rafila A', 'Pitigoi D', 'Arama A', 'Stanescu A', 'Buicu F']",2015,8,1,J Med Life,"Rafila A, et al.

We assessed patient attitudes towards vaccination, knowledge of vaccine recommendations, and uptake of recommended vaccines.
METHODS: Patients attending IBD clinics completed a self-administered, structured, paper-based questionnaire. We collected demographic data, medical and immunisation history, self-reported patient uptake, knowledge, and perceptions of childhood and adult vaccinations.
RESULTS: The prevalence of treatment with biologicals, steroids, thiopurines, and methotrexate among the 300 respondents were 37.3%, 16.0%, 16.0%, and 5.7%, respectively. Self-reported vaccine completion was reported by 45.3% of patients. Vaccination uptake rates were 61.3% for influenza, 10.3% for pneumococcus, 61.0% for hepatitis B, 52.0% for hepatitis A, 26.0% for varicella, 20.7% for meningococcus, 5.3% for herpes zoster, and 11.0% for herpes papilloma virus [females only]. Significant predictors of vaccine completion were annual vaccination review by family physician (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82) or gastroenterologist [OR = 1.72], current steroid use [OR = 1.28], and current or prior treatment with biologicals [OR = 1.42]. The majority of patients reported that the primary responsibility to ensure vaccine completion lies with the patient [41.7%] and the family physician [32.3%]. Uncertainty about indications, fears of side effects, and concerns regarding vaccine safety were the most commonly reported reasons for non-uptake [22.0%, 20.7%, and 5.3%, respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of recommended vaccines among IBD patients is suboptimal. Annual vaccination reviews by both family physician and gastroenterologist may improve vaccine uptake.

25908267,Multi-disease analysis of maternal antibody decay using non-linear mixed models accounting for censoring.,"Biomedical studies often generate repeated measures of multiple outcomes on a set of subjects. It may be of interest to develop a biologically intuitive model for the joint evolution of these outcomes while assessing inter-subject heterogeneity. Even though it is common for biological processes to entail non-linear relationships, examples of multivariate non-linear mixed models (MNMMs) are still fairly rare. We contribute to this area by jointly analyzing the maternal antibody decay for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, allowing for a different non-linear decay model for each infectious disease. We present a general modeling framework to analyze multivariate non-linear longitudinal profiles subject to censoring, by combining multivariate random effects, non-linear growth and Tobit regression. We explore the hypothesis of a common infant-specific mechanism underlying maternal immunity using a pairwise correlated random-effects approach and evaluating different correlation matrix structures. The implied marginal correlation between maternal antibody levels is estimated using simulations. The mean duration of passive immunity was less than 4 months for all diseases with substantial heterogeneity between infants. The maternal antibody levels against rubella and varicella were found to be positively correlated, while little to no correlation could be inferred for the other disease pairs. For some pairs, computational issues occurred with increasing correlation matrix complexity, which underlines the importance of further developing estimation methods for MNMMs.","['Goeyvaerts N', 'Leuridan E', 'Faes C', 'Van Damme P', 'Hens N']",2015,34,20,Stat Med,"Goeyvaerts N, et al.

Recently chicken pox has been reported in adults with more severe systemic and neurological complications. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a life threatening disorder if not treated in time. We report a patient with post varicella CVT as a rare complication of primary Varicella zoster virus.
CASE REPORT: Vasculitic arterial infarction is known while venous stroke has rarely been reported with Varicella-zoster virus infection. Here, we report an immunocompetent 30 yr old male who developed chickenpox after contact with his daughter two month back. He presented with acute neurological deficit, one week after onset of skin lesion. MR venography revealed non-visualisation of left transverse sinus and left sigmoid sinus suggestive of venous sinus thrombosis.
CONCLUSION: Varicella infection is rarely associated with venous sinus thrombosis.

25843508,[Varicella vaccine effectiveness in schoolchildren in outbreaks in a semi-urban area].,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the varicella vaccine in school outbreaks during the academic year 2009-2010.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective cohort study in public day-care centers and/or schools in an area in the region of Murcia. Spain. The participants were all children of 1 to 12 years who were in the same classroom where there was an outbreak of varicella. The main measurements were the sociodemographic, clinical and vaccination data, as well as variables related to varicella disease obtained through a questionnaire self-completed by parents, and from the computerized regional immunization registry (VACUSAN).
RESULTS: A total of 51 varicella outbreaks were detected, with a median of 3 cases per outbreak at both educational levels. The overall vaccination coverage was 10.7% (95% CI 8.63 to 13.18), always being higher in Spanish schoolchildren versus foreign (OR: 21.21, 95% CI: 2.92 to 153.92, P<.001). Discrepancies were found between the vaccine questionnaire data and vaccination program (kappa=0.50, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.58, P<.001). According to VACUSAN, the overall attack rate was 59.7 (95% CI: 55.82 to 63.43) in unvaccinated and 6.5 (95% CI: 2.54 to 15.45) in vaccinated children. An overall effectiveness of 89.1% (95% CI: 74.55 to 95.35) and 100% was obtained for 1 and 2 doses of vaccine, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high effectiveness of varicella vaccine, emphasizing that the administration of two doses of vaccine produces an adequate and optimal protection against varicella disease. A discrepancy was found between the information provided by parents and official records. Finally, there was a lower vaccination coverage in the immigrant community.","['Romera-Guirado FJ', 'Molina-Salas Y', 'Pérez-Martín JJ', 'Ruzafa-Martínez M']",2016,84,1,An Pediatr (Barc),"Romera-Guirado FJ, et al.

With the aim of providing an overview of the epidemiology of varicella in Europe and addressing the different strategies and the experiences so far, we performed a review of epidemiological studies done in Europe from 2004 to 2014. Varicella is mainly a disease of childhood, but sero-epidemiological studies show regional differences in the proportion of susceptible adults. Hospitalisation due to varicella is not common, but complications and hospitalisation mainly affect previously healthy children, which underlines the importance of not dismissing varicella as a disease of little importance. The experience with universal vaccination in Europe shows that vaccination leads to a rapid reduction of disease incidence. Vaccine effectiveness is high and a protective herd effect is obtained. Experience with vaccination in Europe has not been long enough, though, to draw conclusions on benefits and drawbacks with vaccination as well as the capacity for national programs in Europe to maintain a sufficiently high coverage to prevent a change in age group distribution to older children and young adults or on the impact that varicella immunisation may have on the epidemiology of shingles.","['Helmuth IG', 'Poulsen A', 'Suppli CH', 'Mølbak K']",2015,33,21,Vaccine,"Helmuth IG, et al.

The neutralization antibody titers of eleven IVIG preparations from four companies were examined using VZV and CMV with and without complement. The neutralizing antibody titers of intact IgG preparations were three to six times higher after addition of complement. The effectiveness of the sulfonated IgG preparation was not enhanced by complement, but desulfonated IgG regained enhanced neutralization activity with complement. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) toward VZV-infected cells was observed with both intact and sulfonated IVIG and guinea pig splenocytes, but ADCC toward CMV-infected cells was not, although NK cell activity toward cells infected with VZV or CMV was detected by splenocytes. Sulfonated IVIG had no complement-activated neutralization of VZV and CMV but retained ADCC toward VZV with less activity after dilution than with intact IVIG. Because sulfonated IVIG is converted to the intact form after intravenous administration, it would show complement-enhanced neutralization and ADCC activity similar to that of intact IVIG in vivo. In this study we showed the effects of intact and sulfonated IgG on the functional activity of IgG against VZV and CMV.","['Yajima M', 'Shiraki A', 'Daikoku T', 'Oyama Y', 'Yoshida Y', 'Shiraki K']",2015,21,6,J Infect Chemother,"Yajima M, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We defined a case of varicella with maculopapulovesicular rash without other apparent cause in students or staff of the school and residents of neighboring villages of Khalet and Roady since 23(rd) March to 14(th) October, 2009. We line listed case patients and collected information on age, sex, residence, date of onset, symptoms, signs, traveling, treatment history, and vaccination status. The outbreak was described by time, place, and person characteristics. Diagnosis was confirmed epidemiologically and serologically; first to chickenpox, measles, and german measles viruses.
RESULTS: We identified 505 case patients from mixed outbreaks of varicella, measles, and german measles (30/505 clinically, 467/505 epidemiologically linked and 8/505 laboratory confirmed case patients from a study population of 3280. We investigated the suspected outbreak with case definition of varicella but measles 20/3280 (0.60%) and rubella 34/3280 (1.03%) cases were also observed. The overall attack rate (AR) was 15% while in school; it was 22% but highest (56%) in Nursery up to 4(th) standard with index case in first standard. Sex-specific AR was (23%) more in boys. Triple concurrent infection caused 05% complications but no death was reported. Severity of the symptoms was more in 5(th) standard onwards with 49-249 lesions and severer in poor villages Roady and Khalet (P < 0.05). Only 4% were immunized against varicella/german measles privately. Seventeen percent of the cases went for traditional treatment vs modern medicine (P < 0.001). 5/10 samples for IgM antibodies for chickenpox and 2/10 samples were positive for rubella.
CONCLUSIONS: Triple infection of varicella, measles, and rubella was confirmed epidemiologically and serologically. We recommended local authorities for MMRV in the school and near villages with aggressive IEC activities in affected areas.","['Gupta SN', 'Gupta N', 'Gupta S']",2015,4,1,J Family Med Prim Care,"Gupta SN, et al.

25795313,Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) origin of DNA replication oriS influences origin-dependent DNA replication and flanking gene transcription.,"The VZV genome has two origins of DNA replication (oriS), each of which consists of an AT-rich sequence and three origin binding protein (OBP) sites called Box A, C and B. In these experiments, the mutation in the core sequence CGC of the Box A and C not only inhibited DNA replication but also inhibited both ORF62 and ORF63 expression in reporter gene assays. In contrast the Box B mutation did not influence DNA replication or flanking gene transcription. These results suggest that efficient DNA replication enhances ORF62 and ORF63 transcription. Recombinant viruses carrying these mutations in both sites and one with a deletion of the whole oriS were constructed. Surprisingly, the recombinant virus lacking both copies of oriS retained the capacity to replicate in melanoma and HELF cells suggesting that VZV has another origin of DNA replication.","['Khalil MI', 'Sommer MH', 'Hay J', 'Ruyechan WT', 'Arvin AM']",2015,481,,Virology,"Khalil MI, et al.

25794504,A comparison of herpes simplex virus type 1 and varicella-zoster virus latency and reactivation.,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1; human herpesvirus 1) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV; human herpesvirus 3) are human neurotropic alphaherpesviruses that cause lifelong infections in ganglia. Following primary infection and establishment of latency, HSV-1 reactivation typically results in herpes labialis (cold sores), but can occur frequently elsewhere on the body at the site of primary infection (e.g. whitlow), particularly at the genitals. Rarely, HSV-1 reactivation can cause encephalitis; however, a third of the cases of HSV-1 encephalitis are associated with HSV-1 primary infection. Primary VZV infection causes varicella (chickenpox) following which latent virus may reactivate decades later to produce herpes zoster (shingles), as well as an increasingly recognized number of subacute, acute and chronic neurological conditions. Following primary infection, both viruses establish a latent infection in neuronal cells in human peripheral ganglia. However, the detailed mechanisms of viral latency and reactivation have yet to be unravelled. In both cases latent viral DNA exists in an 'end-less' state where the ends of the virus genome are joined to form structures consistent with unit length episomes and concatemers, from which viral gene transcription is restricted. In latently infected ganglia, the most abundantly detected HSV-1 RNAs are the spliced products originating from the primary latency associated transcript (LAT). This primary LAT is an 8.3 kb unstable transcript from which two stable (1.5 and 2.0 kb) introns are spliced. Transcripts mapping to 12 VZV genes have been detected in human ganglia removed at autopsy; however, it is difficult to ascribe these as transcripts present during latent infection as early-stage virus reactivation may have transpired in the post-mortem time period in the ganglia. Nonetheless, low-level transcription of VZV ORF63 has been repeatedly detected in multiple ganglia removed as close to death as possible. There is increasing evidence that HSV-1 and VZV latency is epigenetically regulated. In vitro models that permit pathway analysis and identification of both epigenetic modulations and global transcriptional mechanisms of HSV-1 and VZV latency hold much promise for our future understanding in this complex area. This review summarizes the molecular biology of HSV-1 and VZV latency and reactivation, and also presents future directions for study.","['Kennedy PG', 'Rovnak J', 'Badani H', 'Cohrs RJ']",2015,96,Pt 7,J Gen Virol,"Kennedy PG, et al.

The immune responses of guinea pigs to the intradermal (i.d.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of a heat-inactivated or live VZV vaccine were investigated. Relative to nonimmunized animals, a single 399-PFU dose of vaccine induced nonsignificant increases in gamma interferon (IFN-γ), granzyme B, and perforin mRNA expression in the splenocytes of all groups, while two i.d. administrations of the inactivated vaccine increased IFN-γ mRNA expression significantly (P < 0.005). A single 1,995-PFU dose significantly increased the expression of IFN-γ mRNA in the groups receiving the vaccine either i.d. (P < 0.005) or s.c. (P < 0.05), that of granzyme B mRNA in the groups immunized i.d. with the inactivated (P < 0.005) or live (P < 0.005) vaccine, and that of perforin mRNA in the animals that received the inactivated vaccine i.d. (P < 0.005). Importantly, increases in the expression of IFN-γ (P = 0.025), granzyme B (P = 0.004), and perforin (P > 0.05) mRNAs were observed in the animals immunized i.d. with 1,995 PFU of inactivated vaccine relative to those immunized s.c. with the same dose. The proportion of animals expressing IFN-γ mRNA mirrored the proportion expressing IFN-γ protein (correlation coefficient of 0.88). VZV glycoprotein-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies were produced with no significant intergroup differences. A booster i.d. administration of the 399-PFU dose of heat-inactivated vaccine enhanced the antibody responses. These results demonstrate that i.d. administration of an inactivated VZV vaccine can be an efficient mode of immunization against VZV.","['Sarkadi J', 'Jankovics M', 'Fodor K', 'Kis Z', 'Takacs M', 'Visontai I', 'Jankovics I', 'Gonczol E']",2015,22,5,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Sarkadi J, et al.

25765966,"Immunogenicity and safety of a combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella live vaccine (ProQuad ®) administered concomitantly with a booster dose of a hexavalent vaccine in 12-23-month-old infants.","BACKGROUND: Concomitant administration of vaccines can facilitate vaccination uptake, provided that no clinically significant effect on either vaccine is identified. We investigated the concomitant administration, during the second year of life, of one dose of the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine (ProQuad(®)) with a booster dose of a hexavalent vaccine.
METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label study, participants were randomized to 3 groups: Group 1, concomitant administration of one dose of ProQuad(®) and a booster of hexavalent vaccine; Group 2, one dose of ProQuad(®) alone; Group 3, a booster dose of hexavalent vaccine alone. Two serum samples were collected, within 7 days prior to vaccination and Days 42-56 post-vaccination for antibody testing.
RESULTS: Antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b following concomitant administration of ProQuad(®) and hexavalent vaccine were non-inferior compared with those following the individual vaccines. Antibody response rates to these antigens were all >95% in all groups. Antibody titres for the pertussis antigens following concomitant administration were also non-inferior to those following the individual vaccines. Antibody titres for the other valences were numerically comparable between groups with the exception of hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, tetanus and poliomyelitis, which were higher in the concomitant than in the non-concomitant groups. The safety profiles of each vaccination regimen were comparable, with the exception of solicited ProQuad(®)-related injection-site reactions (Days 0-4), which occurred more frequently in the concomitant than in the non-concomitant groups.
CONCLUSION: These immunogenicity data support the concomitant administration of ProQuad(®) with a hexavalent vaccine.

LAVs are recommended before LT for patients ≥ 6 months of age. However, the evidence supporting this practice is limited. Patients were enrolled before and after LT. Clinical data for patients were obtained from medical records. Serum antibody titers were evaluated at the time of enrollment and prospectively. Serum antibody titers were measured with a hemagglutination inhibition test for measles and rubella and with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for varicella and mumps. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the factors that affect the serostatus. Serological analyses of 49 patients immunized before LT (median age, 45 months; male, 35%) were performed. Underlying diseases were biliary atresia (n = 27; 55%), metabolic diseases (n = 13; 27%), fulminant hepatic failure (n = 5; 10%), and others (n = 4; 8%). The seropositivity rate after each vaccine was 46.9% (measles), 89.4% (rubella), 67.5% (varicella), and 48.8% (mumps). Factors independently associated with seronegativity were a vaccination age < 12 months for measles (P = .002), a lower body weight for varicella (P = 0.01), and underlying diseases other than biliary atresia for mumps (P = .004). No serious adverse event was observed during the study period. The immunogenicity of LAVs before LT was high for rubella but low for the others. Before LT, further vaccination strategies are needed for patients. In addition, serological follow-up may be indicated for patients with factors associated with seronegativity.","['Funaki T', 'Shoji K', 'Miyata I', 'Sakamoto S', 'Kasahara M', 'Yoshii H', 'Miyairi I', 'Saitoh A']",2015,21,6,Liver Transpl,"Funaki T, et al.

25761709,The impact of demographic changes on the epidemiology of herpes zoster: Spain as a case study.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella upon first exposure and may reactivate later in life into herpes zoster (HZ), with a risk that is thought to be reduced by re-exposures to VZV. Given the decades-long time scales of reactivation and its dependence on the accumulation of re-exposure episodes, adopting a long-term perspective may be useful to correctly interpret current epidemiological trends of VZV. In this study, we investigate the possible impact of demographic changes on varicella and HZ in Spain, using an age-structured mathematical model informed with historical demographic data and calibrated against age-specific profiles of varicella seroprevalence and HZ incidence data. The model qualitatively reproduces the remarkable growth of HZ incidence observed in Spain between 1997 and 2004, before the introduction of varicella vaccination programmes. We demonstrate that this growth may be partially ascribed to the reduction of varicella circulation that followed the overall decline of the birth rate in the twentieth century. Model predictions further suggest that, even under the most optimistic projections, HZ incidence will continue its rise until at least 2040. Considering the effect of demographic changes can help interpreting variations in epidemiological trends of HZ, contributing to a more accurate evaluation of vaccination programmes against VZV.","['Marziano V', 'Poletti P', 'Guzzetta G', 'Ajelli M', 'Manfredi P', 'Merler S']",2015,282,1804,Proc Biol Sci,"Marziano V, et al.

25760518,Evaluation of a vaccination strategy by serosurveillance data: The case of varicella.,"Serological studies have many important epidemiologic applications. They can be used to investigate acquisition of various infections in different populations, measure the induction of an immune response in the host, evaluate the persistence of antibody, identify appropriate target groups and the age for vaccination. Serological studies can also be used to determine the vaccine efficacy. Since 1995 a varicella vaccine is available and it has been recommended in several countries (e.g. USA, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Ecuador, etc.). Nevertheless few varicella seroprevalence studies in countries that adopted an URV are available. It is related to the relatively recent introduction of the vaccination and to the lack of structured and collaborative surveillance systems based on serosurvey at national or regional level. Varicella seroprevalence data collected before the introduction of vaccination strategies allowed to establish the age of vaccination (e.g., indicated the opportunity to offer the vaccine to Italian susceptible adolescents). In the post-vaccination era, seroprevalence data demonstrated vaccine as immunogenic and excluded an increase of the age of infection linked to the vaccination strategy. New seroprevalence studies should be performed to answer to open questions, such as the long-term immunity and the change of the herpes zoster epidemiological pattern related to the vaccine.","['Tafuri S', 'Gallone MS', 'Gallone MF', 'Cappelli MG', 'Chironna M', 'Germinario C']",2015,11,4,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Tafuri S, et al.

A serosurvey was conducted to evaluate the impact of extensive vaccination in these ""pilot"" Regions.
DESIGN: Samples were collected in compliance with current legislation and after the approval of the Ethics Committee. The qualitative and quantitative determination of antibodies (IgG) against varicella was performed using an ELISA assay with high sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: 1,470 samples were analyzed. After the decrease of seropositivity associated with the decay of passively acquired antibody titer, there was a progressive increase of seroprevalence in the other age groups. The comparison with what was recorded in two studies conducted with similar assays in the periods 1996/97 and 2003/04, showed a significant increase in seroprevalence following extensive immunization, particularly in the age classes 1 year, 2-4 years and 5-9 years. The proportion of seropositivity in the age classes 1 year and 2-4 years has more than doubled.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old male patient was referred to the National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa City, Japan with iridocyclitis in his right eye. On examination, intraocular pressure was 30 mmHg in the right eye, and biomicroscopy revealed ciliary injection, corneal epithelial edema, mutton fat keratic precipitates, flare, and infiltrating cells in the anterior chamber. Serological tests were negative for anti-VZV antibodies, but VZV-DNA copies of 1.28×10(7) copies/mL were detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using the aqueous humor obtained from the right eye. Iridocyclitis was reduced by administration of oral valaciclovir in addition to corticosteroid eye drops, and serum anti-VZV antibodies were first detected after 4 months' administration. When ocular inflammation was resolved after 6 months, VZV-DNA could not be detected in the aqueous humor any more.
CONCLUSION: VZV-associated uveitis may develop in an adult with undetectable serum anti-VZV antibodies. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction of the aqueous humor is the key investigation necessary for the diagnosis in such cases.","['Mine I', 'Ishikawa S', 'Takeuchi M']",2015,9,,Clin Ophthalmol,"Mine I, et al.

25738815,Laboratory investigations of vaccinated patients with varicella.,"BACKGROUND: Accompanying varicella vaccination in children in Germany recommended with one (2004) and two (2009) doses, sentinel surveillance of varicella with a sample (n∼900) of private physicians was established in 2005. Physicians reported monthly aggregated data on all varicella cases and case-based on vaccinated patients, of whom skin lesion samples were laboratory investigated to identify varicella-zoster virus (VZV). We analyzed the impact of vaccination frequency on the number of cases and on laboratory results within the sentinel.
METHODS: Swabs were obtained with a Teflon tip and sent together with a case-based questionnaire to the reference laboratory. VZV wild-type and vaccine-type was identified by polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) and pyrosequencing methods. Case-based data and laboratory results were analyzed descriptively.
RESULTS: From April 2005 to March 2014, of all monthly reported cases (n=111,456) 4789 were vaccinated and eligible for further analysis. No differences were found between laboratory investigated and not investigated cases (1017 vs. 3772) except that the proportion of cases vaccinated twice was higher in lab-cases (29.4% vs. 16.1%). PCR remained negative in 69.6% (197/283) of breakthrough-cases vaccinated twice, in comparison to 22.7% (147/649) breakthrough-cases vaccinated once. VZV was confirmed in 500 (81) patients with breakthrough varicella after one (two) vaccination(s); identification of VZV wild-type, vaccine-type, or no further differentiation was possible in 485 (72), 5 (6), and 10 (3) cases, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Varicella breakthrough disease is rare in Germany and suspected clinical cases require laboratory confirmation. The lower confirmation rate of VZV after two vaccine doses suggests a better protection compared to one dose.","['Siedler A', 'Dettmann M', 'Tolksdorf K', 'Polte C', 'Walter C', 'Ehlers B']",2015,33,16,Vaccine,"Siedler A, et al.

25726457,"The impact of 2-dose routine measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccination in France on the epidemiology of varicella and zoster using a dynamic model with an empirical contact matrix.","PURPOSE: Varicella has a high incidence affecting the vast majority of the population in France and can lead to severe complications. Almost every individual infected by varicella becomes susceptible to herpes zoster later in life due to reactivation of the latent virus. Zoster is characterized by pain that can be long-lasting in some cases and has no satisfactory treatment. Routine varicella vaccination can prevent varicella. The vaccination strategy of replacing both doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) with a combined MMR and varicella (MMRV) vaccine is a means of reaching high vaccination coverage for varicella immunization. The objective of this analysis was to assess the impact of routine varicella vaccination, with MMRV in place of MMR, on the incidence of varicella and zoster diseases in France and to assess the impact of exogenous boosting of zoster incidence, age shift in varicella cases, and other possible indirect effects.
METHODS: A dynamic transmission population-based model was developed using epidemiological data for France to determine the force of infection, as well as an empirically derived contact matrix to reduce assumptions underlying these key drivers of dynamic models. Scenario analyses tested assumptions regarding exogenous boosting, vaccine waning, vaccination coverage, risk of complications, and contact matrices.
FINDINGS: The model provides a good estimate of the incidence before varicella vaccination implementation in France. When routine varicella vaccination is introduced with French current coverage levels, varicella incidence is predicted to decrease by 57%, and related complications are expected to decrease by 76% over time. After vaccination, it is observed that exogenous boosting is the main driver of change in zoster incidence. When exogenous boosting is assumed, there is a temporary increase in zoster incidence before it gradually decreases, whereas without exogenous boosting, varicella vaccination leads to a gradual decrease in zoster incidence. Changing vaccine efficacy waning levels and coverage assumptions are still predicted to result in overall benefits with varicella vaccination.
IMPLICATIONS: In conclusion, the model predicted that MMRV vaccination can significantly reduce varicella incidence. With suboptimal coverage, a limited age shift of varicella cases is predicted to occur post-vaccination with MMRV. However, it does not result in an increase in the number of complications.

25721380,"Cost-effectiveness of routine varicella vaccination using the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine in France: an economic analysis based on a dynamic transmission model for varicella and herpes zoster.","PURPOSE: Each year in France, varicella and zoster affect large numbers of children and adults, resulting in medical visits, hospitalizations for varicella- and zoster-related complications, and societal costs. Disease prevention by varicella vaccination is feasible, wherein a plausible option involves replacing the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine with the combined MMR and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. This study aimed to: (1) assess the cost-effectiveness of adding routine varicella vaccination through MMRV, using different vaccination strategies in France; and (2) address key uncertainties, such as the economic consequences of breakthrough varicella cases, the waning of vaccine-conferred protection, vaccination coverage, and indirect costs.
METHODS: Based on the outputs of a dynamic transmission model that used data on epidemiology and costs from France, a cost-effectiveness model was built. A conservative approach was taken regarding the impact of varicella vaccination on zoster incidence by assuming the validity of the hypothesis of an age-specific boosting of immunity against varicella.
FINDINGS: The model determined that routine MMRV vaccination is expected to be a cost-effective option, considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of €20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved; routine vaccination was cost-saving from the societal perspective. Results were driven by a large decrease in varicella incidence despite a temporary initial increase in the number of zoster cases due to the assumption of exogenous boosting. In the scenario analyses, despite moderate changes in assumptions about incidence and costs, varicella vaccination remained a cost-effective option for France.
IMPLICATIONS: Routine vaccination with MMRV was associated with high gains in quality-adjusted life-years, substantial reduction in the occurrences of varicella- and zoster-related complications, and few deaths due to varicella. Routine MMRV vaccination is also expected to provide reductions in costs related to hospitalizations, medication use, and general-practitioner visits, as well as indirect costs, and it is expected to be a cost-effective intervention in France (GSK study identifier: HO-12-6924).","['Littlewood KJ', 'Ouwens MJ', 'Sauboin C', 'Tehard B', 'Alain S', 'Denis F']",2015,37,4,Clin Ther,"Littlewood KJ, et al.

25714052,Trends in varicella mortality in the United States: Data from vital statistics and the national surveillance system.,"This manuscript describes trends in US varicella mortality using national vital statistics system data for 2008-2011, the first years of the routine 2-dose varicella vaccination program, and characteristics of varicella deaths reported to CDC during 1996-2013. We obtained data on deaths with varicella as underlying or contributing cause from the 2008-2011 Mortality Multiple Cause-of Death records and calculated rates to compare with the prevaccine and mature 1-dose varicella vaccination program eras. We also reviewed available records of varicella deaths reported to CDC through the national varicella death surveillance. The annual average age-adjusted mortality rate for varicella as the underlying cause was 0.05 per million population during 2008-2011, an 87% reduction from the prevaccine years. Varicella deaths among persons aged <20 y declined by 99% in 2008-2011 compared with prevaccine years. There was a 70% decline in varicella mortality rates among those <20 y in 2008-2011 compared to 2005-2007. Among the 83 deaths reported to CDC during 1996-2013 classified as likely due to varicella, 24 (29%) were among immunocompromised individuals. Five were among persons previously vaccinated with 1 dose of varicella vaccine. In conclusion, although the US varicella vaccination program has significantly reduced varicella disease burden, there are still opportunities to prevent varicella and its associated morbidity and mortality through routine varicella vaccination, catch-up vaccination, and ensuring that household contacts of immunocompromised persons have evidence of immunity.","['Leung J', 'Bialek SR', 'Marin M']",2015,11,3,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Leung J, et al.

25713285,Epidemiology of pediatric herpes zoster after varicella infection: a population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: There are limited population-based data regarding pediatric herpes zoster (HZ).
METHODS: Children aged <12 years with varicella infections between 2000 and 2006 were identified from a national population-based database and followed-up for a diagnosis of HZ until December 2008. Since a routine varicella vaccination program was started in 2004, vaccinated children without medically attended varicella were identified between 2004 and 2006, and followed-up for a diagnosis of HZ until December 2008.
RESULTS: Of 27 517 children with medically attended varicella, 428 developed HZ. The incidence of HZ was 262.1 per 100 000 person-years. Of 25 132 vaccinated children without medically attended varicella, 106 developed HZ. The incidence of HZ was 93.3 per 100 000 person-years. The mean duration from varicella to HZ was 4.12 years. Children diagnosed with varicella at aged <2 years had a higher incidence (P < .001) and shorter duration (P = .04) than those diagnosed aged ≧2 years. Children diagnosed with varicella aged ≥2 but <8 years had a significantly increased incidence of HZ after than before the vaccination program (relative risk = 1.85 at 3 years of follow-up, P = .03). Children with varicella infections had a significantly greater risk of HZ than vaccinated children without a history of varicella (relative risk = 2.31 at 4 years of follow-up, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the population-based epidemiologic characteristics of pediatric HZ among those who contracted varicella. In the early postvaricella vaccination period, an increased HZ incidence was observed among children with varicella infection aged ≥2 years.","['Wen SY', 'Liu WL']",2015,135,3,Pediatrics,Wen SY and Liu WL.

25712420,The relationship between herpes zoster and stroke.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infects >95 % of the world population. Typically, varicella (chickenpox) results from primary infection. The virus then becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. In immunocompromised individuals, VZV reactivates and causes herpes zoster (shingles), pain, and rash in 1-2 dermatomes. Multiple case reports showed a link between stroke and zoster, and recent studies have emerged which reveal that VZV infection of the cerebral arteries directly causes pathological vascular remodeling and stroke (VZV vasculopathy). In the past few years, several large epidemiological studies in Taiwan, Denmark, and the U.K. demonstrated that zoster is a risk factor for stroke and that antiviral therapy may reduce this risk. Herein, the history, clinical features, and putative mechanisms of VZV vasculopathy, as well as recent epidemiological studies demonstrating that zoster increases the risk of stroke, are discussed.","['Nagel MA', 'Gilden D']",2015,15,4,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,Nagel MA and Gilden D.

He developed right sided periorbital varicella gangrenosa which is a form of necrotizing fasciitis secondary to skin infection. Patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir, antibiotics, amphotericin B, extensive debridement and later reconstruction of upper eyelid with skin grafting. Aggressive treatment helped preventing the eyeball and orbital involvement which would have necessitated orbital exenteration. However delayed presentation resulted in necrosis of orbicularis oculi and underlying tissue which resulted in graft retraction and lid dysfunction.

25699494,Cytokine levels are associated with the severity of varicella infections.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella is a highly contagious disease. Epidemics of varicella are seen every year globally and present a threat to public health, especially in China and other developing countries.
METHODOLOGY: Clinical and laboratory findings of 865 varicella patients admitted to Beijing You'an Hospital, China, between January 2011 and December 2013 were collected and analyzed. Patients with isolated complication were grouped as SI (skin infection, n = 132) and LD (liver damage, n = 89). Two hundred and one patients without complications were grouped as control (mild group). Levels of T-cell subtypes and eight serum cytokines and were also tested. Levels of IFNg and IL-6 were monitored prospectively in another 12 grouped patients.
RESULTS: SI was complicated in 21.7% (188/865) of varicella cases, and LD was complicated in 16.8% (145/865). The rates of SI and LD in varicella patients increased rapidly in the past three years. No laboratory findings were associated with SI or LD (all p > 0.05). IL-6 and IFNg levels were correlated with amniotic membrane extract (AME) (p = 0.044 and p = 0.038). Their levels peaked at day 1 of admission, and then started to decline.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of serious complications has become more common in recent years. IL-6 and IFNg may possibly be used as early serum markers for identifying patients at risk of developing complications such as skin infections in varicella.","['Hao M', 'Wang X', 'Du J', 'Liu L', 'Jiao Y', 'Wu H', 'Zheng J', 'Li W']",2015,9,2,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Hao M, et al.

25693586,Bilateral paramedian thalamic syndrome after infection.,"BACKGROUND: Although bilateral paramedian thalamic infarctions occur more frequently in adults than in children, they are rare entities at any age. The syndrome is thought to result from occlusion of the artery of Percheron, which arises as a common trunk from one of the posterior cerebral arteries to supply both paramedian thalamic regions. We describe two children with acute ischemic infarction involving both paramedian thalami developing after infection.
PATIENTS: The first patient developed mutism with ataxia after chicken pox infection. The second child developed headache, somnolence, agitation, and speech dysfunction following an upper respiratory tract infection. Bilateral thalamic lesions were documented on magnetic resonance imaging of both children.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral infarctions of the paramedian thalamus may result in severe illness and impairment. Common clinical manifestations include disorientation, confusion, hypersomnolence, deep coma and ""coma vigil,"" or akinetic mutism (awake unresponsiveness), as well as severe memory impairment.","['Kamaşak T', 'Sahin S', 'Eyüboğlu İ', 'Reis GP', 'Cansu A']",2015,52,2,Pediatr Neurol,"Kamaşak T, et al.

The present study was an open label, randomized, controlled, phase III, multicentre trial, conducted to evaluate and compare the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a freeze dried live attenuated Oka strain Varicella Vaccine (VR 795 Oka strain) with Varilrix (Oka-RIT strain) in children. A total of 268 healthy Indian children aged 12 months to 12 y with baseline VZV IgG antibody (<100 mIU/ mL) were enrolled, and 256 children completed the study. The extent of rise of VZV IgG antibody titer assessed as 3-fold and 4-fold rise from baseline was found to be significantly higher (89.1% and 85.2%) in the test group as compared to control group (73.4% and 61.7%). The post-vaccination GMT of the test group was significantly higher (112.5 mIU/mL) as compared with the control group (67.8 mIU/mL) (P < 0.001). The seroconversion rate considering the 5 gp ELISA units/ml equivalent to 10mIU/ml were similar in the control (96.5%) and the test (98.3%) groups.

25665961,Effectiveness and safety of immunization with live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines for pediatric liver transplantation recipients.,"BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation recipients are at high risk for severe complications due to infections because of being treated with immunosuppressive drugs that affect the immune system. Vaccination for liver transplantation candidates is generally recommended before surgery, but the opportunities for vaccination prior to transplantation in pediatric candidates are often limited by severe disease conditions.
METHODS: The participants in this study comprised 39 pediatric recipients of living donor liver transplantation performed between 2005 and 2013. Criteria for administering live-attenuated (measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella) and inactivated (hepatitis B, pertussis, and Japanese encephalitis) vaccines were as follows: (1) >1 year after transplantation; (2) no use of systemic steroids to treat acute rejection within the last 6 months; (3) serum trough concentration of tacrolimus <5 ng/mL; (4) no severe immunosuppression according to blood examinations; and (5) provision of written informed consent. Median age at transplantation was 17 months, and median period from transplantation to the beginning of immunization was 18 months.
RESULTS: Seroprotection rates for measles, rubella, mumps, varicella, hepatitis B, pertussis, and Japanese encephalitis after post-transplant immunization were 44% (11/25), 70% (19/27), 48% (12/25), 32% (6/19), 83% (19/23), 87% (13/15), and 88% (7/8), respectively. Seroprotection rates for measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella after second vaccination for recipients with primary vaccine failure after first vaccination were 100% (8/8), 50% (1/2), 71% (5/7), and 50% (5/10), respectively. While four recipients contracted mumps and eight contracted varicella before immunization, one recipient developed varicella after immunization. No serious systemic adverse events were observed in vaccinated recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: Seroprotection rates for measles, mumps, and varicella appeared low in children after the first post-transplantation vaccination. Immunizations with four live-attenuated and three inactivated vaccines were safe and effective for pediatric liver transplantation recipients who were not severely immunosuppressed.","['Kawano Y', 'Suzuki M', 'Kawada J', 'Kimura H', 'Kamei H', 'Ohnishi Y', 'Ono Y', 'Uchida H', 'Ogura Y', 'Ito Y']",2015,33,12,Vaccine,"Kawano Y, et al.

We describe a 38-month-old girl with necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome following varicella. She was previously healthy and vaccinated against varicella at 12 months of age. She had been diagnosed with varicella three days prior to presenting at our facility; she developed fever, vomiting, and painful swelling on her left flank. Her skin lesions worsened, she became lethargic, and had episodes of hypotension and coagulopathy. Necrotizing fasciitis on the left abdominal wall, buttocks, and left thigh was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging, and group A Streptococcus was isolated from a tissue culture. She was diagnosed as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and successfully treated with repeated surgical debridement and fasciotomy, in addition to intensive antibiotics. Our experience suggests that necrotizing fasciitis in patients with varicella should be considered to be a rare complication even with widespread vaccine use.

25636148,Arsenic exposure and prevalence of the varicella zoster virus in the United States: NHANES (2003-2004 and 2009-2010).,"BACKGROUND: Arsenic is an immunotoxicant. Clinical reports observe the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in people who have recovered from arsenic poisoning and in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia that have been treated with arsenic trioxide.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between arsenic and the seroprevalence of VZV IgG antibody in a representative sample of the U.S.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 3,348 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 and 2009-2010 pooled survey cycles. Participants were eligible if they were 6-49 years of age with information on both VZV IgG and urinary arsenic concentrations. We used two measures of total urinary arsenic (TUA): TUA1 was defined as the sum of arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid, and TUA2 was defined as total urinary arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine.
RESULTS: The overall weighted seronegative prevalence of VZV was 2.2% for the pooled NHANES sample. The geometric means of TUA1 and TUA2 were 6.57 μg/L and 5.64 μg/L, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, race, income, creatinine, and survey cycle, odds ratios for a negative VZV IgG result in association with 1-unit increases in natural log-transformed (ln)-TUA1 and ln-TUA2 were 1.87 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.44) and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.97), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional analysis, urinary arsenic was inversely associated with VZV IgG seroprevalence in the U.S.

Vaccination is a recommended preventive measure. There are no studies evaluating the practice of vaccination in patients with early RA.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency of vaccination and the orientation (by the doctor) about vaccines among patients with early RA diagnosis.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study including patients from the early RA Brasilia cohort. Demographic data, disease activity index (Disease Activity Score 28 - DAS28), functional disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire - HAQ), and data on treatment and vaccination after diagnosis of RA were analyzed.
RESULTS: 68 patients were evaluated, 94.1% women, mean age 50.7±13.2 years. DAS28 was 3.65±1.64, and HAQ was 0.70. Most patients (63%) had vaccination card. Only five patients (7.3%) were briefed by the doctor about the use of vaccines. Patients were vaccinated for MMR (8.8%), tetanus (44%), yellow fever (44%), hepatitis B (22%), influenza (42%), H1N1 (61.76%), pneumonia (1.4%), meningitis (1.4%), and chickenpox (1.4%). All patients vaccinated with live attenuated virus were undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, and were vaccinated inadvertently, without medical supervision. There was no association between the use of any vaccine and disease activity, functional disability, years of education, lifestyle, and comorbidities.

25619214,"[Analysis of protective effect of using chickenpox live attenuated vaccine among 4-17 years old children in Minhang district, Shanghai].","OBJECTIVES: To survey on the vaccination of varicella live attenuated vaccine among 4-17 children in Minhang District, and analyze the protective effect against varicella.
METHODS: We collected outbreak chickenpox cases reported from infectious disease report system and surveillance units in Minhang district from 1st May in 2012 to 30th Apr in 2013. The 1: 3 matched case-control study was conducted to questionnaire the legal guardian of the cases and control group, and calculate the protective effect and effective term of protection. The survey included vaccination, chickenpox exposure history, previous history of varicella illness, suffering from the symptoms of chickenpox, the vaccinations brand, etc. The criteria of accepted case were those healthy students who were in the same class with those chickenpox cases. The accepted matched controlling data were those children who were from the same class with outbreak chickenpox cases without varicelliform eruption, similar live condition, the closest house, the same gender, the closest age. This study investigated 390 cases of patients and the control group included 1 170 cases. Chi-square test was used to compare the vaccination of cases and controls, as well as the incidence of chickenpox vaccination different brands VarV, Mantel-Haenzel chi-square test was applied to compare the protective effect of the two groups.
RESULTS: VarV overall vaccination rate was 68.3% (1 065/1 560), among them, the case group coverage was 45.1% (176/390), significantly lower than the control group (76.0% (889/1 170)) (χ² = 128.55, P < 0.01). The coverage in children of 4-10 years old group was 88.4% (375/424), significantly higher than the 11-17 years old group (60.7% (690/1 136)) (χ² = 109.40, P < 0.01). The overall protective effect of VarV was 78.10% (71.82%-82.98%).Vaccinated group incidence ratio was 16.5% (176/1 065), significantly lower than the unvaccinated group (43.2% (214/495)) (χ² = 128.55, P < 0.01). The chickenpox risk of the children who were vaccinated was lower than those who were not, and the OR (95%CI) was 0.22(0.17-0.28) . Proportion of the fever and the typical symptoms of varicella zoster were 26.1% (46/176), 8.0% (14/176) in the children vaccinated VarV, significantly lower than children without VarV vaccination history (54.7% (117/214) , 18.2% (39/214) ) (χ² values were 32.33 and 8.67, respectively. P values both <0.01). The varicella incidence was 17.4% (139/797) in children vaccinated domestic VarV, and it was 13.8% (37/268) in the group of imported VarV (χ² = 1.92, P = 0.184) . The average duration of effective protection period for domestic and imported VarV was (6.2 ± 2.7), (6.3 ± 3.4) years (F = 2.24, P = 0.136).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of varicella incidence and the proportion of fever or typical varicella zoster were lower in the one dose of VarV vaccinated; Effective protective effect was consistent in the children with domestic or imported VarV vaccination.","['Du Y', 'Yu F', 'Zhang L', 'Wang X', 'Jin B', 'Wang Y', 'Mei K', 'Lu J', 'Jiang L']",2014,48,12,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Du Y, et al.

25611033,Survey of Immunization Practices in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Among Pediatric Gastroenterologists.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine vaccination practices of pediatric gastroenterologists, as well as barriers to following immunization guidelines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: Institutions listed in the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition clinical research registry and/or ImproveCareNow were contacted. A total of 657 physicians from 129 institutions were asked to complete a 16-question electronic survey.
RESULTS: A total of 178 physicians (27.1%) responded, of whom 55% were male and 83.1% practiced in an academic setting. A total of 11 physicians (6.2%) do not routinely assess vaccination status, whereas 63.5% assess at the time of diagnosis, 29.8% at ""well"" visits, and 44.4% before initiating immunosuppression. At diagnosis, 51.1% verbally inquire about immunization status, 30.9% obtain records, and 9.0% obtain serology.The influenza (78%), hepatitis B (84%), and varicella (82%) vaccines were most frequently assessed. Fewer than 55.5% of physicians reviewed other vaccines. Physicians using a reminder mechanism were more likely to review immunizations at established visits (41.1% vs 20.8%), and before transfer to an adult gastroenterologist (14.4% vs 2.6%). Lack of coordination of care with primary care practitioners (41%), poor access to immunization records (36%), and inability to offer vaccinations in their immediate area (55%) are barriers to vaccination. Only 28% believed that primary care practitioners were solely responsible for immunizations.
CONCLUSIONS: There is practice variation among pediatric gastroenterologists in assessment of immunizations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including the specific vaccines assessed, and timing and method of assessment. Inability to coordinate care, access immunization records, and offer vaccines through their medical practice are barriers to adhering to immunization guidelines.","['Lester R', 'Lu Y', 'Tung J']",2015,61,1,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Lester R, et al.

Clinical, histopathological and direct immunoflourescence evaluation is important for the diagnosis of this entity. We report a case of LPP in a 5-year-old girl child probably triggered by an episode of preceding varicella. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology and immunofluorescence examination.

25586860,The role of temperature in reported chickenpox cases from 2000 to 2011 in Japan.,"Annual periodicities of reported chickenpox cases have been observed in several countries. Of these, Japan has reported a two-peaked, bimodal annual cycle of reported chickenpox cases. This study investigated the possible underlying association of the bimodal cycle observed in the surveillance data of reported chickenpox cases with the meteorological factors of temperature, relative humidity and rainfall. A time-series analysis consisting of the maximum entropy method spectral analysis and the least squares method was applied to the chickenpox data and meteorological data of 47 prefectures in Japan. In all of the power spectral densities for the 47 prefectures, the spectral lines were observed at the frequency positions corresponding to the 1-year and 6-month cycles. The optimum least squares fitting (LSF) curves calculated with the 1-year and 6-month cycles explained the underlying variation of the chickenpox data. The LSF curves reproduced the bimodal and unimodal cycles that were clearly observed in northern and southern Japan, respectively. The data suggest that the second peaks in the bimodal cycles in the reported chickenpox cases in Japan occurred at a temperature of approximately 8·5 °C.","['Harigane K', 'Sumi A', 'Mise K', 'Kobayashi N']",2015,143,12,Epidemiol Infect,"Harigane K, et al.

25575412,Sentinel physician's network in Reunion Island: a tool for infectious diseases surveillance.,"UNLABELLED: The surveillance of infectious diseases in Reunion Island is based on a sentinel network of family physicians (FPs) coordinated by the Indian Ocean regional institute for public health surveillance (French acronym OI Cire). The objectives are to identify and monitor outbreaks of influenza, gastroenteritis, and chicken pox, and to characterize circulating influenza viruses. The network can monitor other potentially epidemic diseases.
METHOD: The Réunion sentinel network ensures a continuous and permanent surveillance. Physicians send their weekly activity data to the Cire that collects, processes, and interprets it; they also collect samples for biological surveillance of influenza. Statistical thresholds, based on historical data and the estimated numbers of incident cases, are calculated to follow the trend, detect outbreaks, and quantify their impact.
RESULTS: The network currently includes 56 FPs and pediatricians, accounting for 6.5% of FPs on the island. The network has clarified the seasonality of influenza during the austral winter and identified the seasonality of acute diarrhea with an epidemic peak when school starts in August. The sentinel FPs's reports allowed monitoring the epidemic trend and estimating the number of cases during the 2005 and 2006 chikungunya outbreaks and 2009 influenza A (H1N1) outbreaks.
CONCLUSION: The network has proven its contribution, responsiveness, and reliability for epidemiological surveillance during outbreak. It is an essential tool for infectious diseases surveillance in Reunion Island.","['Brottet E', 'Jaffar-Bandjee MC', 'Rachou E', 'Polycarpe D', 'Ristor B', 'Larrieu S', 'Filleul L']",2015,45,01월 02일,Med Mal Infect,"Brottet E, et al.

25569568,A 'cocoon immunization strategy' among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A 'cocoon strategy' is defined as the strategy of protecting vulnerable patients from infectious diseases by vaccinating those in close contact with them. In our study, we evaluate the vaccination status among children living with patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to determine the realization of the cocoon strategy and to identify characteristics associated with pediatric vaccine refusal.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A self-completed survey was conducted on 136 hospitalized patients with IBD. The survey comprised questions about household child vaccination coverage, the reasons for vaccine refusal, and the history of infectious diseases among the patients.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients reported living with children. Forty percent of children were vaccinated with at least one of the recommended vaccines. Most frequently, children received pneumococcal (26%) and rotaviruses (22%) vaccines. The most common reason for nonimmunization was patients' opinion that immunizations are not necessary for them (52%). There was a statistically significant association between the nonreimbursed vaccines coverage and the educational level of the patients (P<0.0001). Despite the fact that 28% of the patients could not definitively recall varicella infection, none of them and none of the children in their household had been vaccinated against chickenpox.
CONCLUSION: The use of nonmandatory vaccines recommended in family members of patients with IBD is insufficient. Further vaccine promotion and education of patients as well as their healthcare providers is required. A particular concern is associated with the pneumococcal, influenza, rotaviruses, and varicella infections. Nonimmunized and varicella-zoster virus-seronegative patients should be vaccinated, and in case of immunosuppression, vaccination of children in the household is required.","['Waszczuk K', 'Waszczuk E', 'Mulak A', 'Szenborn L', 'Paradowski L']",2015,27,3,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Waszczuk K, et al.

32226323,Aerosol-Transmitted Infections-a New Consideration for Public Health and Infection Control Teams.,"Since the emergence of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2003 reemergence of avian A/H5N1, the emergence of the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1, the 2012 emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the 2013 emergence of avian A/H7N9 and the 2014 Ebola virus outbreaks, the potential for the aerosol transmission of infectious agents is now routinely considered in the investigation of any outbreak. Although many organisms have traditionally been considered to be transmitted by only one route (e.g. direct/indirect contact and/or faecal-orally), it is now apparent that the aerosol transmission route is also possible and opportunistic, depending on any potentially aerosol-generating procedures, the severity of illness and the degree and duration of pathogen-shedding in the infected patient, as well as the environment in which these activities are conducted.This article reviews the evidence and characteristics of some of the accepted (tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox, whooping cough) and some of the more opportunistic (influenza, ","['Tang JW', 'Wilson P', 'Shetty N', 'Noakes CJ']",2015,7,3,Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,"Tang JW, et al.

In contrast to the situation in temperate climates, not all adults are infected during childhood. Therefore, hospital staff are tested when first employed; of those aged between 20-29 years, 40% do not have antibodies against the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). We describe three cases of adults, aged 37, 51 and 90 years respectively, who presented with chickenpox. Compared to children, the clinical course in adults is more severe with the potential risk of life-threatening complications. In pregnancy or concomitant T cell immune deficiency, risk of a fulminant course is even higher. Treatment with aciclovir or valaciclovir is effective and associated with few side-effects. Passive immunization with VZV-immunoglobulin is indicated within 96 hours of exposure, typically followed by acyclovir or valaciclovir. As migration occurs from low endemic tropical areas to high endemic temperate areas, we should be aware of the risk of adult chickenpox in these migrants.","['Hanssen JL', 'Schakel GJ', 'Fontilus-Rohoman JM', 'Eeftinck Schattenkerk JK']",2015,160,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Hanssen JL, et al.

25534179,Seasonal variation and trend of chicken pox in the southern region of Saudi Arabia (2007-2012).,"INTRODUCTION: Chicken pox is a contagious disease caused by varicella zoster virus. Children are most susceptible to infection. In 1998, the WHO recommended that routine childhood varicella vaccination be considered in countries where the disease is a relatively important public health concern. There are few data on the trends of chicken pox. We aimed to evaluate the trend of chicken pox in Saudi Arabia (KSA) during the period 2007-2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected by retrospective review of the existing anonymous surveillance records and book registries of chicken pox cases at the preventive medicine department of Armed Forces Hospital of the Southern Region of Saudi Arabia from 2007 to 2012. The collected data included the number, age, and sex of registered cases.
RESULTS: A seasonal pattern was clearly demonstrated, with peak in March and April. There was also a decreasing trend from 2007 to 2012. Most cases occurred in the age group 4-15 years. The number of infected male patients was a little higher compared with female patients. These results indicate success in controlling the disease in the southern region of Saudi Arabia, which may be attributed to the implementation of public health interventions targeted at reducing infectious diseases (such as the introduction of varicella zoster vaccine in 2008).
RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend that a future study be conducted on the severity of chicken pox infection in adults (hospitalization, complications, and death) and a national survey among adults for the seroprevalence of markers of infection with varicella zoster.","['Saleh N', 'Al Moghazy B']",2014,89,3,J Egypt Public Health Assoc,Saleh N and Al Moghazy B.

25529291,Factors that affect voluntary vaccination of children in Japan.,"Some important vaccinations are not included in the routine childhood immunization schedule in Japan. Voluntary vaccinations are usually paid as an out-of-pocket expense. Low voluntary vaccination coverage rates and high target disease incidence are assumed to be a consequence of voluntary vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to explore factors associated with voluntary vaccination patterns in children. We conducted an online survey of 1243 mothers from a registered survey panel who had at least one child 2 months to <3 years of age. The voluntary vaccination mainly correlated positively with annual household income and mothers' positive opinions about voluntary vaccinations, but negatively with number of children. Financial support, especially for low income households and households with more than one child, may motivate parents to vaccinate their children. Communication is also an important issue. More opportunities for education and information about voluntary vaccinations should be provided to mothers without distinguishing between voluntary and routine vaccination.","['Shono A', 'Kondo M']",2015,33,11,Vaccine,Shono A and Kondo M.

25518427,Lack of evidence that avian oncogenic viruses are infectious for humans: a review.,"Chickens may be infected with three different oncogenic viruses: avian leukosis virus (ALV), reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), and Marek's disease herpesvirus (MDV). Several epidemiological studies have suggested a link between these viruses and different types of cancer in people working in poultry processing plants and with multiple sclerosis. In this article, we analyze the epidemiological evidence that these viruses are causative agents for human cancer, followed by description of the relevant key characteristics of ALV, REV, and MDV. Finally, we discuss the biological evidence or lack thereof that avian tumor viruses are involved in the etiology of human cancer and multiple sclerosis (MS). The recent primary epidemiologic articles that we reviewed as examples were only hypothesis-generating studies examining massive numbers of risk factors for associations with various imprecise, non-viral-specific outcomes. The studies lacked precise evidence of exposure to the relevant viruses and the statistical methods failed to adjust for the large risks of false-positive claims. ALV subgroups A-D and J have been eradicated in the United States from the pure lines down to the parent stocks by the breeder companies, which have greatly reduced the incidence of infection in layer flocks and broilers. As a consequence, potential exposure of humans to these viruses has greatly diminished. Infection of humans working in processing plants with ALV-A and ALV-B is unlikely, because broilers are generally resistant to infection with these two subgroups. Moreover, these viruses enter cells by specific receptors present on chicken, but not on mammalian, cells. Infection of mammalian cell cultures or animals with ALV-A, ALV-B, and ALV-J has not been reported. Moreover, humans vaccinated with exogenous or endogenous ALV-contaminated vaccines against yellow fever, measles, and mumps did not become antibody- or virus-positive for ALV. The risks for human infection with REV are similarly limited. First of all, REV also has been eradicated from pure lines down to parent stock by breeder companies in the United States. Broilers can still become infected with REV through infection with fowl pox virus containing REV. However, there is no indication that REV can infect human cells. Low levels of antibodies to ALV and REV in human sera have been reported by a few groups. Absorption of sera with chicken antigens reduced the antibody titers, and there was no clear association with contacts with poultry. Possible cross-reactions with human endogenous or exogenous retroviruses were not considered in these publications. MDV is typically associated with infection of chickens, and almost all experimental data show that MDV cannot infect mammalian cells or animals, including nonhuman primates. One study reports the presence of MDV gD DNA in human sera, but this finding could not be confirmed by another group. A Medline search of the term ""gene expression in human cancers"" was negative for publications with avian retroviruses or MDV. In conclusion, there is no indication that avian oncogenic viruses are involved in human cancer or MS or even able to infect and replicate in humans.","['Schat KA', 'Erb HN']",2014,58,3,Avian Dis,Schat KA and Erb HN.

25483695,Hospitalization with varicella and shingles before and after introduction of childhood varicella vaccination in Germany.,"In Germany, one dose of varicella vaccination has been recommended for children aged <24 months since 2004, and 2 doses have been recommended since 2009. Vaccination coverage (VC) is above 80% for one dose and 60% for 2 doses. In this study, data on varicella- and shingles-associated hospitalizations before and after vaccine introduction were assessed. Based on ICD-coded data of the main diagnosis of hospitalized cases from 1995-2012 in Germany, annual age-adjusted and age-specific hospitalization incidences (cases/100,000; HI) were calculated. HI means 1995-2003 (pre-vaccination-period) versus 2005-2012 (post-vaccination-period) were compared. Age-specific trends and annual percentage change rates (APC) were assessed by joinpoint regression. Overall age-adjusted varicella-HI decreased from 3.3/100,000 pre-vaccination to 1.9/100,000 post vaccination. The decline was greatest in regions with the highest VC. The post-vaccination decline was greatest in children aged <1, 1-4, and 5-9 y, who had APCs of -18.2,-27.2 and -15.2, respectively, and significant joinpoints. In all other age groups no post-vaccination joinpoints were detected or they did not lead to a consistent trend. Age-adjusted shingles-HI increased from 8.8/100,000 (1995) to 16.8/100,000 (2012). Shingles-HI increased in all age groups with no significant post-vaccination joinpoints, except in children<1 and 1-4 y, where APCs of -5.6 and -3.6 were detected. Varicella vaccination significantly reduced varicella-HI in children below 10 y, but was not definitely related to varicella-HI in older age groups. A consistent increase of shingles-HI began before varicella vaccination was introduced and was not affected by vaccination.","['Siedler A', 'Dettmann M']",2014,10,12,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Siedler A and Dettmann M.

25483542,"The impact of ten years of infant universal Varicella vaccination in Sicily, Italy (2003-2012).","INTRODUCTION: Universal varicella vaccination in Sicily was introduced in infant population since 2003, with a rapidly increasing coverage. Aim of the present study was to analyze changes in the epidemiology of varicella since the introduction of universal vaccination.
METHODS: The study was performed by analyzing Sicilian administrative/clinical data on varicella case notifications and hospitalizations from 2003 to 2012 (ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis codes 052 and 052.×). MMR+V and V coverage were also calculated for each birth cohort. Moreover, blood samples drawn in 2013/2014 from general population stratified by age were tested for varicella antibodies.
RESULTS: From 2003 to 2012, 15 433 varicella cases were notified with a decreasing temporal trend (1.1/1000 population in 2003 to 0.1/1000 in 2012) (P < 0.001). In the same period, a total of 1145 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of varicella, with a 6-fold reduced risk of hospitalization over time (from 4.8 to 0.8/100 000 population per year; P < 0.001). Varicella vaccination coverage rates increased from 40% (2001 birth cohort) to 85% (2010 birth cohort), and inversely correlated with both notification and hospitalization rates (P < 0.001). Finally, 80.0% of subjects enrolled in the seroepidemiological survey were positive for varicella and seroprevalence increased significantly with age in both sexes (P < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: The results show the impact of infant universal varicella vaccination in Sicily. Noteworthy, notifications and hospitalizations for varicella have significantly decreased after the introduction of universal vaccination, confirming the effectiveness of the adopted strategy.","['Amodio E', 'Tramuto F', 'Cracchiolo M', 'Sciuto V', 'De Donno A', 'Guido M', 'Rota MC', 'Gabutti G', 'Vitale F']",2015,11,1,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Amodio E, et al.

25483538,"Effectiveness of vaccination against varicella in children under 5 years in Puglia, Italy 2006-2012.","In Italy, between 2003 and 2010, 8/21 Regions recommended varicella routine vaccination (URV). The National Immunization Plan (PNPV) 2012-2014 scheduled the introduction of URV nationwide in 2015, following the results achieved by the eight Regions.   Puglia adopted varicella URV in 2006. This study describes epidemiology and costs of varicella in Puglia between 2003 and 2012. One-dose Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) against varicella of any severity and severe hospitalized cases in children was also evaluated. Vaccination coverage (VC) was estimated from the regional immunization registry. Incidence and hospitalization rates were calculated from computerised surveillance system for communicable diseases and hospital discharge registry (ICD9-CM codes: 052.x), respectively. URV impact was assessed by Incidence Rate Ratios (IIRs) and Hospitalization Risk Ratios (HRRs). Hospitalization costs were also evaluated. VE was estimated using the screening method, where PPV was VC in children aged &lt;72 months and PCV was the proportion of cases vaccinated among notified or hospitalized cases, respectively. One-dose VC in children aged ≤ 24 months increased from 49% in the birth cohort 2006 to 91.1% in the cohort 2010; 2-dose VC was 64.8% and 28.8% in the 2005 and 1997 cohort, respectively. Comparing pre and post-vaccination era, incidence declined from 122.5 ×100 000 in 2003-2005 to 13.7 in 2009-2012 (IRR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.10-0.12), hospitalization rate from 3.9 ×100 000 to 1.1 (HRR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.21-0.4), hospitalization costs from 319 000 Euros/year to 106 000. One-dose VE against varicella of any severity and severe hospitalized disease was 98.8% and 99%, respectively. Our findings strongly support varicella URV introduction into the Italian Essential Health Interventions, as scheduled by 2015.","['Tafuri S', 'Fortunato F', 'Cappelli MG', 'Cozza V', 'Bechini A', 'Bonanni P', 'Martinelli D', 'Prato R']",2015,11,1,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Tafuri S, et al.

25483522,Reducing the burden of Herpes Zoster in Italy.,"Herpes Zoster (HZ) is a viral disease with painful neuro-dermatologic manifestations. Incidence increases with age. In Italy, the estimated incidence is 6.3 cases/1000 person/year; hospital admissions are less than 2%, 69% in patients aged over 65 years. The most frequent complication of HZ is Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) characterized by metameric pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. In Italy 20.6% and 9.2% of HZ patients experience PHN after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Available antiviral and analgesic treatments are relatively unsatisfactory in reducing pain and length of the disease. Prevention has recently become possible with the live attenuated vaccine Oka/Merck. Clinical studies show a reduction of 51% in the incidence of the disease, 61% of its burden and 67% of PHN in vaccinees. Protection seems to be long lasting and vaccine safety matches registration requirements. Available evidence suggests that the costs for QALY (less than € 20 000) and avoided cases is favorable. Due to the heavy burden of disease, it is time to offer this vaccination to elderly population.","['Gabutti G', 'Franco E', 'Bonanni P', 'Conversano M', 'Ferro A', 'Lazzari M', 'Maggi S', 'Rossi A', 'Scotti S', 'Vitale F', 'Volpi A', 'Greco D']",2015,11,1,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Gabutti G, et al.

25475956,Vaccination against varicella as post-exposure prophylaxis in adults: a quantitative assessment.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella can be severe in adults. When universal vaccination is not adopted, post-exposure prophylaxis has been recommended in adults with uncertain history of varicella to reduce the burden of the disease in adults, however its impact is not quantified.
METHODS: We developed a Bayesian probabilistic framework to estimate the impact of post-exposure prophylaxis in adults. We hypothesized that post-exposure vaccination would be proposed only after varicella exposure in close relatives. Information regarding the nature of the culprit exposure was obtained from a sample of 221 adult varicella cases. The lifelong probability that adults aged 18 would be infected with varicella was determined using data from the French Sentinelles surveillance network. Estimates of post-exposure vaccination efficacy were then used to compute the number of cases and hospitalizations prevented in adults.
RESULTS: Familial exposure to varicella was reported by 81 adult cases out of 221. The probability of infection after exposure was 32%, so that six exposures on average were necessary to explain the observed cumulated lifetime incidence of varicella in non-immune 18 years old and over adults. Among the 35% of the 18 years old population with uncertain history of varicella, 11% would truly be non-immune. Post-exposure vaccination would prevent 26% of the cases (13 cases prevented per 100,000 adults per year) and 31% of the hospitalizations (0.2 hospitalizations prevented per 100,000 adults per year) if vaccination acceptance was 70%. An average of 16 adults would be vaccinated to avert one varicella case.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-exposure vaccination is associated with a substantial decrease in the burden of the disease in adults in a country where universal vaccination is not recommended. This quantitative information may help inform professionals to uphold the recommendation.","['Souty C', 'Boos E', 'Turbelin C', 'Blanchon T', 'Hanslik T', 'Boëlle PY']",2015,33,3,Vaccine,"Souty C, et al.

At present, the incidence of rheumatic fever is decreasing in these countries, giving way to an increasing occurrence of invasive streptococcal group A infections with high level of morbidity and mortality. Streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis, a specific entity, emerged these last decades, often in association with chickenpox. The introduction of the varicella vaccine in the province of Quebec routine immunization program, was followed by a significant decrease in the number of necrotizing fasciitis or other skin and soft-tissues infections in our pediatric population. However, in our experience at the CHU Sainte-Justine, this immunization program has not been helpful to reduce the overall incidence of invasive group A streptococcal infections. Conversely, an increase in the number of pleuro-pulmonary and osteo-articular infections was observed.","['Ovetchkine P', 'Bidet P', 'Minodier P', 'Frère J', 'Bingen E', 'in memoriam']",2014,21 Suppl 2,,Arch Pediatr,"Ovetchkine P, et al.

VZV vaccination of children reduces exposure to chickenpox in the population and it has been hypothesized that this could increase the prevalence of shingles. This 'exogenous boosting' effect of VZV raises an important equity concern: introducing a vaccination program could advance the health of one population group (children) at the expense of another (adults and elderly). We discuss the program's justifiability from two ethical perspectives, classic utilitarianism and contractualism. Whereas the former framework might offer a foundation for the case against introducing this vaccination, the latter offers a basis to justify it.","['Luyten J', 'Ogunjimi B', 'Beutels P']",2014,32,52,Vaccine,"Luyten J, et al.

25424949,One-dose vaccination associated with attenuated disease severity of adolescent and adult varicella cases in Beijing's Fengtai District.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the number of varicella cases in adults has significantly increased in Beijing. However, the effect of the vaccination on varicella-related characteristics among adults has not been studied.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using data from the Infectious Disease Reporting System and the Immunization Information System, we compared the epidemiology and disease severity in breakthrough and unvaccinated varicella cases in adolescents and adults (≥ 15 year-old) from 2008 to 2011 in Beijing's Fengtai district, China. The results showed that the age (P = 0.003),contact history (90% vs. 73%, P = 0.019) and outbreak cases (10% vs. 1%, P < 0.0001) were significantly differently distributed between the two groups and that both the incidence of moderate-to-severe cases (26% vs. 45%, P = 0.035, OR = 0.446) and varicella-associated fever (49% vs. 66%, P = 0.068, OR = 0.534) were either significantly lower or trended to be lower in the breakthrough group than in the unvaccinated group. Additionally,vaccine effectiveness against moderate-to-severe cases of varicella was 55.4%.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, these results indicate that vaccination against varicella among adolescents and adults affected the epidemiology and attenuated the disease severity of the cases.

25410871,Abortive intrabronchial infection of rhesus macaques with varicella-zoster virus provides partial protection against simian varicella virus challenge.,"UNLABELLED: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human neurotropic alphaherpesvirus and the etiological agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (HZ, shingles). Previously, inoculation of monkeys via the subcutaneous, intratracheal, intravenous, or oral-nasal-conjunctival routes did not recapitulate all the hallmarks of VZV infection, including varicella, immunity, latency, and reactivation. Intrabronchial inoculation of rhesus macaques (RMs) with simian varicella virus (SVV), a homolog of VZV, recapitulates virologic and immunologic hallmarks of VZV infection in humans. Given that VZV is acquired primarily via the respiratory route, we investigated whether intrabronchial inoculation of RMs with VZV would result in a robust model. Despite the lack of varicella and viral replication in either the lungs or whole blood, all four RMs generated an immune response characterized by the generation of VZV-specific antibodies and T cells. Two of 4 VZV-inoculated RMs were challenged with SVV to determine cross-protection. VZV-immune RMs displayed no varicella rash and had lower SVV viral loads and earlier and stronger humoral and cellular immune responses than controls. In contrast to the results for SVV DNA, no VZV DNA was detected in sensory ganglia at necropsy. In summary, following an abortive VZV infection, RMs developed an adaptive immune response that conferred partial protection against SVV challenge. These data suggest that a replication-incompetent VZV vaccine that does not establish latency may provide sufficient protection against VZV disease and that VZV vaccination of RMs followed by SVV challenge provides a model to evaluate new vaccines and therapeutics against VZV.
IMPORTANCE: Although VZV vaccine strain Oka is attenuated, it can cause mild varicella, establish latency, and in rare cases, reactivate to cause herpes zoster (HZ). Moreover, studies suggest that the HZ vaccine (Zostavax) only confers short-lived immunity. The development of more efficacious vaccines would be facilitated by a robust animal model of VZV infection. The data presented in this report show that intrabronchial inoculation of rhesus macaques (RMs) with VZV resulted in an abortive VZV infection. Nevertheless, all animals generated a humoral and cellular immune response that conferred partial cross-protection against simian varicella virus (SVV) challenge. Additionally, VZV DNA was not detected in the sensory ganglia, suggesting that viremia might be required for the establishment of latency. Therefore, VZV vaccination of RMs followed by SVV challenge is a model that will support the development of vaccines that boost protective T cell responses against VZV.","['Meyer C', 'Engelmann F', 'Arnold N', 'Krah DL', 'ter Meulen J', 'Haberthur K', 'Dewane J', 'Messaoudi I']",2015,89,3,J Virol,"Meyer C, et al.

25358998,Varicella zoster virus vaccines: potential complications and possible improvements.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (shingles). After primary infection, the virus remains latent in sensory ganglia, and reactivates upon weakening of the cellular immune system due to various conditions, erupting from sensory neurons and infecting the corresponding skin tissue. The current varicella vaccine (v-Oka) is highly attenuated in the skin, yet retains its neurovirulence and may reactivate and damage sensory neurons. The reactivation is sometimes associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a severe pain along the affected sensory nerves that can linger for years, even after the herpetic rash resolves. In addition to the older population that develops a secondary infection resulting in herpes zoster, childhood breakthrough herpes zoster affects a small population of vaccinated children. There is a great need for a neuro-attenuated vaccine that would prevent not only the varicella manifestation, but, more importantly, any establishment of latency, and therefore herpes zoster. The development of a genetically-defined live-attenuated VZV vaccine that prevents neuronal and latent infection, in addition to primary varicella, is imperative for eventual eradication of VZV, and, if fully understood, has vast implications for many related herpesviruses and other viruses with similar pathogenic mechanisms.","['Silver B', 'Zhu H']",2014,29,5,Virol Sin,Silver B and Zhu H.

Following a successful vaccination programme, the incidence of varicella in Australia was modelled to decrease and the incidence of zoster to increase, based on a theoretical decrease in boosting of zoster immunity following a decrease in wild varicella virus circulation due to vaccination. Incidence risks (consultation proportions for varicella and zoster) were directly age-standardised to the Melbourne population in 2000, when varicella vaccine was first available. Age-standardised varicella incidence risk peaked in 2000 and halved by 2012. Age-standardised zoster incidence risk remained constant from 1998 to 2002, but had almost doubled by 2012. The increase in zoster consultations largely reflected increases in people younger than 50 years-old. Although causality cannot be inferred from ecological studies, it is generally agreed that the decrease in varicella incidence is due to increasing varicella vaccine coverage. The possible indirect effect of the vaccine on zoster incidence is less clear and ongoing monitoring of zoster is required.","['Kelly HA', 'Grant KA', 'Gidding H', 'Carville KS']",2014,19,41,Euro Surveill,"Kelly HA, et al.

25331144,Herpes zoster on the face in the elderly.,"Herpes zoster is a localised disease caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that enters the cutaneous nerve endings during an earlier episode of chicken pox, travels to the dorsal root ganglia, and remains in latent form. The condition is characterised by occurrence of multiple, painful, unilateral vesicles and ulceration, and shows a typical single dermatome innervated by single dorsal root or cranial sensory ganglion. Involvement of three or more dermatomes is known as disseminated zoster and seen in immunocompromised individuals. Complications of herpes zoster include ocular sequelae, bacterial superinfection of the lesions, meningoencephalitis and postherpetic neuralgia. The incidence of herpes zoster increases with age and immunosuppression, therefore prompt management is necessary to avoid morbidity and mortality in these individuals. We present two case reports of herpes zoster, one involving the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve while the other involves all branches of the trigeminal nerve.","['Nair P', 'Gharote H', 'Singh P', 'Jain-Choudhary P']",2014,2014,,BMJ Case Rep,"Nair P, et al.

25321068,"Vaccination coverage among children in kindergarten - United States, 2013-14 school year.","State and local vaccination requirements for school entry are implemented to maintain high vaccination coverage and protect schoolchildren from vaccine-preventable diseases. Each year, to assess state and national vaccination coverage and exemption levels among kindergartners, CDC analyzes school vaccination data collected by federally funded state, local, and territorial immunization programs. This report describes vaccination coverage in 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) and vaccination exemption rates in 46 states and DC for children enrolled in kindergarten during the 2013-14 school year. Median vaccination coverage was 94.7% for 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine; 95.0% for varying local requirements for diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine; and 93.3% for 2 doses of varicella vaccine among those states with a 2-dose requirement. The median total exemption rate was 1.8%. High exemption levels and suboptimal vaccination coverage leave children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases. Although vaccination coverage among kindergartners for the majority of reporting states was at or near the 95% national Healthy People 2020 targets for 4 doses of DTaP, 2 doses of MMR, and 2 doses of varicella vaccine, low vaccination coverage and high exemption levels can cluster within communities. Immunization programs might have access to school vaccination coverage and exemption rates at a local level for counties, school districts, or schools that can identify areas where children are more vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases. Health promotion efforts in these local areas can be used to help parents understand the risks for vaccine-preventable diseases and the protection that vaccinations provide to their children.","['Seither R', 'Masalovich S', 'Knighton CL', 'Mellerson J', 'Singleton JA', 'Greby SM', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']",2014,63,41,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Seither R, et al.

25314141,Varicella-zoster DNA in saliva of patients with meningoencephalitis: a preliminary study.,"OBJECTIVES: Since the routine use of polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) in diagnosing herpes infections, varicella-zoster virus is increasingly recognized as a cause of varicella-zoster meningoencephalitis (VZV ME) among immunocompetent patients. We were interested to determine whether patients with VZV ME had VZV DNA in their saliva during the acute phase of the illness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five consecutive patients who underwent a lumbar puncture for diagnostic purposes were included in the study. The cerebrospinal fluid was examined for the presence of VZV DNA by PCR, and patients with positive findings were treated with acyclovir. The saliva was later analyzed in a blinded fashion for the presence of VZV DNA.
RESULTS: VZV DNA was found in saliva in four of five (80%) patients with PCR confirmed VZV ME (sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.84, and likelihood ratio 5). This was significantly more than in patients with non-zoster viral ME (0%, P = 0.009), parainfectious headache (12%, P = 0.03) and controls (9.5%, P = 0.007). In immunocompromised patients with systemic lymphoma and AIDS, VZV DNA was present at a similar rate (67%, P = 0.6).
CONCLUSIONS: We have found VZV DNA in saliva of patients with PCR confirmed VZV ME at a higher proportion than in controls and patients with non-VZV viral ME. This finding might be of clinical importance, especially in immunocompetent individuals with suspected VZV ME where the results of genetic and immunological testing are not conclusive.","['Pollak L', 'Mehta SK', 'Pierson DL', 'Sacagiu T', 'Avneri Kalmanovich S', 'Cohrs RJ']",2015,131,6,Acta Neurol Scand,"Pollak L, et al.

25313676,Does antibody binding to diverse antigens predict future infection?,"We studied diverse antigen binding in hosts and the outcome of parasitism. We used captive-bred F1 descendants of feral rock pigeons (Columba livia) challenged with blood-feeding flies (Hippoboscidae) and a protozoan parasite (Haemoproteus). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and immunoblots were used to test (i) whether pre-infection IgY antigen binding predicts parasite fitness and (ii) whether antigen binding changes after infection. Assays used extracts from three pigeon parasites (northern fowl mite, Salmonella bacteria and avian pox virus), as well as nonparasitic molecules from cattle, chicken and keyhole limpet. Binding to hippoboscid and S. enterica extracts were predictive of hippoboscid fly fitness. Binding to extracts from hippoboscids, pox virus and nonparasitic organisms was predictive of Haemoproteus infection levels. Antigen binding to all extracts increased after parasite challenge, despite the fact that birds were only exposed to flies and Haemoproteus. Immunoblots suggested innate Ig binding to parasite-associated molecular markers and revealed that new antigens were bound in extracts after infection. These data suggest that host antibody binding to diverse antigens predicts parasite fitness even when the antigens are not related to the infecting parasite. We discuss the implications of these data for the study of host-parasite immunological interaction.","['Owen JP', 'Waite JL', 'Holden KZ', 'Clayton DH']",2014,36,11,Parasite Immunol,"Owen JP, et al.

25297839,Genetic variation in the HLA region is associated with susceptibility to herpes zoster.,"Herpes zoster, commonly referred to as shingles, is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV initially manifests as chicken pox, most commonly in childhood, can remain asymptomatically latent in nerve tissues for many years and often re-emerges as shingles. Although reactivation may be related to immune suppression, aging and female sex, most inter-individual variability in re-emergence risk has not been explained to date. We performed a genome-wide association analyses in 22,981 participants (2280 shingles cases) from the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. Using Cox survival and logistic regression, we identified a genomic region in the combined and European ancestry groups that has an age of onset effect reaching genome-wide significance (P>1.0 × 10(-8)). This region tags the non-coding gene HCP5 (HLA Complex P5) in the major histocompatibility complex. This gene is an endogenous retrovirus and likely influences viral activity through regulatory functions. Variants in this genetic region are known to be associated with delay in development of AIDS in people infected by HIV. Our study provides further suggestion that this region may have a critical role in viral suppression and could potentially harbor a clinically actionable variant for the shingles vaccine.","['Crosslin DR', 'Carrell DS', 'Burt A', 'Kim DS', 'Underwood JG', 'Hanna DS', 'Comstock BA', 'Baldwin E', 'de Andrade M', 'Kullo IJ', 'Tromp G', 'Kuivaniemi H', 'Borthwick KM', 'McCarty CA', 'Peissig PL', 'Doheny KF', 'Pugh E', 'Kho A', 'Pacheco J', 'Hayes MG', 'Ritchie MD', 'Verma SS', 'Armstrong G', 'Stallings S', 'Denny JC', 'Carroll RJ', 'Crawford DC', 'Crane PK', 'Mukherjee S', 'Bottinger E', 'Li R', 'Keating B', 'Mirel DB', 'Carlson CS', 'Harley JB', 'Larson EB', 'Jarvik GP']",2015,16,1,Genes Immun,"Crosslin DR, et al.

25282129,Global mortality from conditions with skin manifestations.,"BACKGROUND: Global Burden of Disease Study is a research database containing systematically compiled information from vital statistics and epidemiologic literature to inform research, public policy, and resource allocation.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare mortality among conditions with skin manifestations in 50 developed and 137 developing countries from 1990 to 2010.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study to calculate mean age-standardized mortality (per 100,000 persons) across countries for 10 disease categories with skin manifestations. We compared differences in mortality from these disorders by time period (year 1990 vs year 2010) and by developing versus developed country status.
RESULTS: Melanoma death rates were 5.6 and 4.7 times greater in developed compared with developing countries in 1990 and 2010, respectively. Measles death rates in 1990 and 2010 were 345 and 197 times greater in developing countries, and corresponding syphilis death rates were 33 and 45 times greater.
LIMITATIONS: Inability to adjust for patient-, provider-, and geographic-level confounders may limit the accuracy and generalizability of these results.
CONCLUSION: The mortality burden from skin-related conditions differs between developing and developed countries, with the greatest differences observed for melanoma, measles, and syphilis. These results may help prioritize and optimize efforts to prevent and treat these disorders.","['Boyers LN', 'Karimkhani C', 'Naghavi M', 'Sherwood D', 'Margolis DJ', 'Hay RJ', 'Williams HC', 'Naldi L', 'Coffeng LE', 'Weinstock MA', 'Dunnick CA', 'Pederson H', 'Vos T', 'Dellavalle RP']",2014,71,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Boyers LN, et al.

It can cause a variety of serious and life-threatening complications. Generally, the most frequent complication of varicella in healthy children is bacterial superinfection, but empyema after VZV infection is a rare condition. This case report describes a previously healthy 21-month-old boy who attended nursery school with a recent varicella and group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis outbreak and who presented with a 7 day history of vesicular rash along with progressive fever. Due to continued mild cough and prolonged fever, however, chest radiography was done, which showed a right pleural effusion. Further computed tomography showed a right pulmonary empyema, and purulent material was drained and eventually grew GABHS.

25250786,"Estimating the effectiveness of early control measures through school absenteeism surveillance in observed outbreaks at rural schools in Hubei, China.","BACKGROUND: School absenteeism is a common data source in syndromic surveillance, which allows for the detection of outbreaks at an early stage. Previous studies focused on its correlation with other data sources. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of control measures based on early warning signals from school absenteeism surveillance in rural Chinese schools.
METHODS: A school absenteeism surveillance system was established in all 17 primary schools in 3 adjacent towns in the Chinese region of Hubei. Three outbreaks (varicella, mumps, and influenza-like illness) were detected and controlled successfully from April 1, 2012, to January 15, 2014. An impulse susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model was used to fit the epidemics of these three outbreaks. Moreover, it simulated the potential epidemics under interventions resulting from traditional surveillance signals. The effectiveness of the absenteeism-based control measures was evaluated by comparing the simulated datasets.
RESULTS: The school absenteeism system generated 52 signals. Three outbreaks were verified through epidemiological investigation. Compared to traditional surveillance, the school absenteeism system generated simultaneous signals for the varicella outbreak, but 3 days in advance for the mumps outbreak and 2-4 days in advance for the influenza-like illness outbreak. The estimated excess protection rates of control measures based on early signals were 0.0%, 19.0-44.1%, and 29.0-37.0% for the three outbreaks, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although not all outbreak control measures can benefit from early signals through school absenteeism surveillance, the effectiveness of early signal-based interventions is obvious. School absenteeism surveillance plays an important role in reducing outbreak spread.","['Fan Y', 'Yang M', 'Jiang H', 'Wang Y', 'Yang W', 'Zhang Z', 'Yan W', 'Diwan VK', 'Xu B', 'Dong H', 'Palm L', 'Liu L', 'Nie S']",2014,9,9,PLoS One,"Fan Y, et al.

25236583,A seroprevalence survey on varicella among adults in the vaccination era in Apulia (Italy).,"In 2006, the Apulia Region (Italy) introduced universal routine vaccination (URV) against varicella disease. The coverage for one dose of varicella vaccine at 24 month of age reached 91.1% in 2010 birth-cohort. Vaccination coverage for the second dose at 5-6 years was 64.8% for the cohort 2005, and 28.8% for adolescents born in 1997. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pattern of immunity/susceptibility to varicella in Apulian adults by a seroprevalence survey carried out 6 years after the introduction of URV. The study was carried out from May 2011 to June 2012 among blood donors of the Department of Transfusion Medicine of Policlinico General Hospital in Bari. Subjects were enrolled by a convenience sample. For each enrolled patient we collected a sample of serum of 5 ml. Anti-VZV IgG in collected sera were analyzed by chemiluminescence (CLIA). We enrolled 1769 subject; 1365 (77.2%) were male with a mean age of 38.4 ± 11.7 years. 93% (95% CI=91.7-94.1) of enrolled subject presented a titre of anti-VZV IgG >164 mIU/mL. GMT of anti-VZV IgG titre was 1063.4 mIU/ml and no difference was observed between different age group. According to our data, URV did not seem to have any impact on susceptibility among adults and in particular we did not note any cluster of susceptible subjects among young adults. Also in the vaccination era, we did not note that the average age of infection shifts among adults and then we could exclude an increase of case of complicated varicella related to the URV.","['Tafuri S', 'Gallone MS', 'Cappelli MG', 'Gallone MF', 'Larocca AM', 'Germinario C']",2014,32,48,Vaccine,"Tafuri S, et al.

Presumptive evidence of immunity to MMRV is recommended for HCP. The aim of this investigation was to examine the seroprevalence of MMRV in Japanese HCP and the association with history or vaccination in terms of occupational safety. To improve infection control at our hospital, we also assessed their immune status by implementing prevaccination antibody screening and an immunization program with postvaccination serological testing. We implemented seroprevalence surveys on MMRV antibodies among 243 newly and 2,664 previously hired HCP in a Japanese tertiary care hospital. Self-administered questionnaires about history of MMRV and vaccination with or without written documentation were completed for newly hired HCP. Prevaccination and postvaccination serological tests were performed using virus-specific IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Indeed, only a few HCP accurately remembered or had written records of their disease or vaccination history. After our immunization program was implemented, the seropositivity rate reached levels as high as ~98% for measles, rubella, and varicella, and increased to ~80% for mumps. Our program was cost-effective, and no severe adverse reactions were reported. The prevaccination antibody screening for HCP would be helpful, given the lack of written vaccination records or documented disease history, and is also useful for the prevention of adverse reactions associated with unnecessary vaccination. It is important for infection control practitioners to comprehend the immune status of HCP against MMRV, and then provide an appropriate immunization program for susceptible HCP.","['Kanamori H', 'Tokuda K', 'Ikeda S', 'Endo S', 'Ishizawa C', 'Hirai Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Aoyagi T', 'Hatta M', 'Gu Y', 'Yano H', 'Weber DJ', 'Kaku M']",2014,234,2,Tohoku J Exp Med,"Kanamori H, et al.

25222565,Control of varicella in the post-vaccination era in Australia: a model-based assessment of catch-up and infant vaccination strategies for the future.,"In Australia, varicella vaccine was universally funded in late 2005 as a single dose at 18 months. A school-based catch-up programme for children aged 10-13 years without a history of infection or vaccination was funded until 2015, when those eligible for universal infant vaccination would have reached the age of high school entry. This study projects the impact of discontinuing catch-up vaccination on varicella and zoster incidence and morbidity using a transmission dynamic model, in comparison with alternative policy options, including two-dose strategies. At current vaccine coverage (83% at 2 years and 90% at 5 years), ceasing the adolescent catch-up programme in 2015 was projected to increase varicella-associated morbidity between 2035 and 2050 by 39%. Although two-dose infant programmes had the lowest estimated varicella morbidity, the incremental benefit from the second dose fell by 70% if first dose coverage increased from 83% to 95% by age 24 months. Overall zoster morbidity was predicted to rise after vaccination, but differences between strategies were small. Our results suggest that feasibility of one-dose coverage approaching 95% is an important consideration in estimating incremental benefit from a second dose of varicella vaccine.","['Gao Z', 'Wood JG', 'Gidding HF', 'Newall AT', 'Menzies RI', 'Wang H', 'McIntyre PB', 'MacIntyre CR']",2015,143,7,Epidemiol Infect,"Gao Z, et al.

25219564,Varicella-zoster virus immunity among health care workers in Catalonia.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunity among healthcare workers (HCWs). Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: HCWs attending voluntary periodic health examinations between June 2008 and December 2010.
SETTING: Six public hospitals and five primary care areas in Catalonia, Spain.
METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was given to eligible HCWs. Variables including age, sex, professional category, type of centre, history of varicella infection, and VZV vaccination were collected. The study was carried out using a convenience sample. The prevalence of antibodies and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of the history of clinical VZV infection or vaccination were calculated. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR and ORa) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine the variables associated with antibody prevalence.
RESULTS: Of 705 HCWs who agreed to participate, 644 were finally included. The overall prevalence of antibodies to varicella was 94.9% (95% CI: 92.9-96.4). Of the variables studied, only age was associated with serological susceptibility to VZV. HCWs aged 25-35 years had the highest serological susceptibility (8.1%, 95% CI: 4.6-13.0). The prevalence of antibodies was 96% in subjects reporting previous VZV infection or vaccination, compared with 93% in subjects who did not report these states or did not know.
CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of serologically-susceptible HCWs found in this study indicates the need to develop for screening and vaccination strategies in Catalonia. Due to the high capacity of propagation of the VZV in health settings and its consequences, VZV vaccination programmes in HCWs should be reinforced.","['Urbiztondo L', 'Bayas JM', 'Broner S', 'Costa J', 'Esteve M', 'Campins M', 'Borrás E', 'Domínguez A', 'Working Group for the Study of the Immune Status in Healthcare Workers of Catalonia']",2014,32,45,Vaccine,"Urbiztondo L, et al.

This paper describes the safety following a 2-dose regimen of MMRV administered to children in the second year of life.
METHODS: Safety data from five clinical studies were combined for all children who were scheduled to receive two doses of MMRV ∼3-6 months apart. All vaccinated children were followed for safety following each dose of MMRV.
RESULTS: Of 3112 children who received a first dose of MMRV, 2780 (89.3%) received a second dose of MMRV. Overall, 70.5% and 57.7% of children reported ≥1 adverse experiences following first and second doses of MMRV, respectively. Injection-site redness was statistically significantly higher postdose 2 than postdose 1, while injection-site pain/tenderness was statistically significantly higher postdose 1 compared to postdose 2. Rashes were statistically significantly lower postdose 2 compared to postdose 1. Ten febrile seizures (8 postdose 1, 2 postdose 2) were reported following MMRV vaccination. The incidence of febrile seizures postdose 1 of MMRV was 0.26% (8/3019) compared to 0.07% (2/2695) postdose 2 of MMRV.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of two doses of MMRV has an acceptable safety profile in children 12 to 23 months of age. There is a small increase in the risk of febrile seizures following the first dose of MMRV as compared to the component vaccines, but the risk for any individual child is relatively low.","['Klopfer SO', 'Stek JE', 'Petrecz M', 'Reisinger KS', 'Black SB', 'Goveia MG', 'Nicholson O', 'Gardner JL', 'Grosso AD', 'Brown ML', 'Kuter BJ', 'Schödel FP']",2014,32,52,Vaccine,"Klopfer SO, et al.

25211543,"Assessment of varicella surveillance and outbreak control practices - United States, 2012.","Case-based varicella (chickenpox) surveillance is important for monitoring the impact of the varicella vaccination program. In 2002, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) recommended that all states move toward case-based varicella surveillance by 2005; in 2003, varicella was made nationally notifiable. To ease the transition to case-based reporting, CSTE and CDC recommended starting with sentinel site or outbreak surveillance and then moving to statewide case-based surveillance when feasible. To gauge progress in varicella surveillance, in 2012 CDC and CSTE developed a survey for assessing varicella surveillance practices, which CSTE administered to all states and the District of Columbia (DC). As of 2012, varicella was reportable in 44 (86.3%) of the 51 jurisdictions surveyed, of which 37 (84.1%) conduct statewide case-based surveillance. Of the 38 jurisdictions conducting statewide or sentinel site varicella case-based surveillance, more than 84% reported collecting information on age, sex, and race/ethnicity (all 97.4%), vaccination status (94.7%), outbreak association (86.8%), and disease severity (84.2%). Nineteen (43.2%) of the 44 jurisdictions where reporting was mandated transmitted varicella-specific data to CDC using Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging. Currently, HL7 messaging is the only mechanism available for states to send varicella-specific data to CDC. Although public health agencies have made much progress to strengthen varicella surveillance throughout the United States, strategies are needed to facilitate transmission of varicella-specific data to CDC from all jurisdictions, using HL7 messaging, and to increase the number of jurisdictions collecting the varicella-specific data necessary to monitor varicella epidemiology and the impact of the vaccination program nationally.","['Lopez AS', 'Lichtenstein M', 'Schmid SD', 'Bialek S']",2014,63,36,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Lopez AS, et al.

25184898,Shingles vaccination: background and advice for community nurses.,"Shingles (or zoster) is a reactivation of an existing varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. During the initial infection, VZV causes a systemic disease known as varicella or chickenpox, and this initial infection normally occurs early in childhood in the absence of routine vaccination. Although varicella is normally a mild disease, shingles is associated with significant morbidity and some mortality, particularly in older people. The most significant severe consequence is post-herpetic neuralgia. There is an effective vaccine available for this, known as Zostavax, which is a live-attenuated VZV vaccine. Guidelines in the UK recommend that this is offered to everyone when they become 70 years of age, plus those aged 79 years as part of a catch-up campaign, with those between these ages not being eligible. It is important for all health-care professionals, including district and community nurses, to proactively promote this vaccine, so that those eligible can make an informed decision about whether to receive it.",['Purssell E'],2014,19,9,Br J Community Nurs,Purssell E.

Although older individuals can also be affected or vaccinated, outbreaks among adults are rare. We investigated a small outbreak of varicella in B-cell lymphoma patients for elucidation of risk factor of the disease. We experienced four cases of varicella after an index herpes zoster case. All varicella cases were confirmed varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection by PCR. All varicella cases occurred in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients receiving rituximab-containing chemotherapy. On the other hand, only three of the 18 non-varicella patients in the same room were receiving rituximab-containing chemotherapy (P = 0.005). All varicella patients had detectable serum anti-varicella zoster virus IgG antibodies before chemotherapy. Even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to the virus, lymphoma patients treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy can possibly become re-infected with varicella. These findings suggest that zoster patients should be strictly isolated in hematology and oncology ward, and prophylactic acyclovir should be considered for such patients when exposed to zoster/varicella.","['Okamoto A', 'Abe A', 'Okamoto M', 'Kobayashi T', 'Inaguma Y', 'Tokuda M', 'Yanada M', 'Morishima S', 'Kanie T', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Tsuzuki M', 'Mizuta S', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Yatsuya H', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Emi N']",2014,20,12,J Infect Chemother,"Okamoto A, et al.

25177074,Varicella and herpes zoster hospitalizations before and after implementation of one-dose varicella vaccination in Australia: an ecological study.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) hospitalization following the availability and subsequent National Immunization Programme funding of one-dose varicella vaccination in Australia.
METHODS: Varicella vaccination coverage for children born between 2001 and 2009 was obtained from the Australian Childhood Immunization Register. Principal or any coded varicella or HZ hospitalizations were retrieved from the national hospital morbidity database from 1998 to 2010. Trends in hospitalization rates in different age groups and indigenous status were assessed. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated between periods before and after implementation of immunization programme funding.
FINDINGS: In the first year of the funded immunization programme, varicella vaccine coverage reached 75% in children aged 24 months and more than 80% in children aged 60 months. Compared with the pre-vaccine period, varicella hospitalization rates during the funded programme were significantly lower for age groups younger than 40 years; with the greatest reduction in children aged 18-59 months (IRR: 0.25; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.22-0.29). Indigenous children had a higher varicella hospitalization rate compared with non-indigenous children before vaccine implementation (IRR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.7), but afterwards reached equivalence (IRR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.7-1.6). The age-standardized HZ hospitalization rate declined between the periods (IRR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97).
CONCLUSION: Rapid attainment of high coverage reduced varicella hospitalizations in the targeted age group, particularly for indigenous children, but also in non-targeted age groups, with no increase in HZ hospitalizations. This suggests high one-dose varicella vaccine coverage can have a substantial impact on severe disease.","['Heywood AE', 'Wang H', 'Macartney KK', 'McIntyre P']",2014,92,8,Bull World Health Organ,"Heywood AE, et al.

25163043,Improving pediatric immunization rates: description of a resident-led clinical continuous quality improvement project.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increased emphasis is being placed on the continuous quality improvement (CQI) education of residents of all specialties. This article describes a resident-led continuous quality improvement (CQI) project, based on a novel curriculum, to improve the immunization rates of children under 2 years old at the Madsen Family Health Center (MHC).
METHODS: All third-year residents were trained in the FOCUS-PDSA CQI methodology through concurrent didactic lectures and experience leading the CQI team. The CQI team included clinical staff led by a third-year family medicine resident and mentored by a member of the family medicine faculty. Immunization records were distributed to provider-medical assistant teamlets daily for each pediatric patient scheduled in clinic as the intervention. Compliance with the intervention (process measure), as well as immunization rates at 2 and 5 months post-intervention (outcome measure), were monitored.
RESULTS: Immunization records were printed on 84% of clinic days from October 24, 2011 to March 31, 2012. The percentage of patients immunized at baseline was 66%. The percentage immunized as of December 31, 2011 was 96% and was 91% as of March 31, 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: An important educational experience was organized for third-year family medicine residents through learning CQI skills, leading a CQI team, and directing a CQI project to completion. Significant improvement in the percentage of patients under 2 years old immunized at the MHC was achieved by presenting provider-medical assistant teamlets with immunization records of all pediatric patients on the daily clinic schedule.","['Jones KB', 'Gren LH', 'Backman R']",2014,46,8,Fam Med,"Jones KB, et al.

25142604,Intrabronchial infection of rhesus macaques with simian varicella virus results in a robust immune response in the lungs.,"UNLABELLED: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Primary VZV infection is believed to occur via the inhalation of virus either in respiratory droplets or from shedding varicella lesions or by direct contact with infectious vesicular fluid. However, the ensuing immune response in the lungs remains incompletely understood. We have shown that intrabronchial inoculation of rhesus macaques with simian varicella virus (SVV), a homolog of VZV, recapitulates the hallmarks of acute and latent VZV infection in humans. In this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the host immune response to acute SVV infection in the lungs and peripheral blood. We report that acute SVV infection results in a robust innate immune response in the lungs, characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors as well as an increased frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) that corresponded with alpha interferon (IFN-α) production and a rapid decrease in viral loads in the lungs. This is followed by T and B cell proliferation, antibody production, T cell differentiation, and cytokine production, which correlate with the complete cessation of viral replication. Although terminally differentiated CD8 T cells became the predominant T cell population in bronchoalveolar lavage cells, a higher percentage of CD4 T cells were SVV specific, which suggests a critical role for these cells in the resolution of primary SVV infection in the lungs. Given the homology between SVV and VZV, our data provide insight into the immune response to VZV within the lung.
IMPORTANCE: Although primary VZV infection occurs primarily via the respiratory route, the host response in the lungs and its contribution to the cessation of viral replication and establishment of latency remain poorly understood. The difficulty in accessing lung tissue and washes from individuals infected with VZV has hampered efforts to address this knowledge gap. SVV infection of rhesus macaques is an important model of VZV infection of humans; therefore, we utilized this animal model to gain a comprehensive view of the kinetics of the immune response to SVV in the lung and its relationship to the resolution of acute infection in respiratory tissues. These data not only advance our understanding of host immunity to VZV, a critical step in developing new vaccines, but also provide additional insight into immunity to respiratory pathogens.","['Haberthur K', 'Meyer C', 'Arnold N', 'Engelmann F', 'Jeske DR', 'Messaoudi I']",2014,88,21,J Virol,"Haberthur K, et al.

Valganciclovir (V-GCV), a valine ester pro-drug of GCV orally administrable, has recently shown great activity against CMV infections, but there are no reports of its clinical efficacy against VZV. We here report a case history of a patient with positive serologic test for VZV, who underwent allogeneic HSCT and developed an atypical varicella-like illness. First-line therapy with foscarnet had to be discontinued due rapid development of renal impairment (creatinine: 2.60 mg/dL, urea: 130.6 mg/dL) and therefore was switched to V-GCV. The renal impairment and skin lesions of the patient fully recovered after few days of therapy, even though the patient had complete lymphocyte depletion. This is the first case of a patient with chickenpox-like illness treated successfully with V-GCV.","['Maximova N', 'Antonio P', 'Marilena G', 'Rovere F', 'Tamaro P']",2015,123,1,APMIS,"Maximova N, et al.

25106793,"The dynamical consequences of seasonal forcing, immune boosting and demographic change in a model of disease transmission.","The impact of seasonal effects on the time course of an infectious disease can be dramatic. Seasonal fluctuations in the transmission rate for an infectious disease are known mathematically to induce cyclical behaviour and drive the onset of multistable and chaotic dynamics. These properties of forced dynamical systems have previously been used to explain observed changes in the period of outbreaks of infections such as measles, varicella (chickenpox), rubella and pertussis (whooping cough). Here, we examine in detail the dynamical properties of a seasonally forced extension of a model of infection previously used to study pertussis. The model is novel in that it includes a non-linear feedback term capturing the interaction between exposure and the duration of protection against re-infection. We show that the presence of limit cycles and multistability in the unforced system give rise to complex and intricate behaviour as seasonal forcing is introduced. Through a mixture of numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis, we identify and explain the origins of chaotic regions of parameter space. Furthermore, we identify regions where saddle node lines and period-doubling cascades of different orbital periods overlap, suggesting that the system is particularly sensitive to small perturbations in its parameters and prone to multistable behaviour. From a public health point of view - framed through the 'demographic transition' whereby a population׳s birth rate drops over time (and life-expectancy commensurately increases) - we argue that even weak levels of seasonal-forcing and immune boosting may contribute to the myriad of complex and unexpected epidemiological behaviours observed for diseases such as pertussis. Our approach helps to contextualise these epidemiological observations and provides guidance on how to consider the potential impact of vaccination programs.","['Dafilis MP', 'Frascoli F', 'McVernon J', 'Heffernan JM', 'McCaw JM']",2014,361,,J Theor Biol,"Dafilis MP, et al.

Reassurance of vaccine safety remains critical for population health. This study systematically reviewed the literature on the safety of routine vaccines recommended for children in the United States.
METHODS: Data sources included PubMed, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices statements, package inserts, existing reviews, manufacturer information packets, and the 2011 Institute of Medicine consensus report on vaccine safety. We augmented the Institute of Medicine report with more recent studies and increased the scope to include more vaccines. Only studies that used active surveillance and had a control mechanism were included. Formulations not used in the United States were excluded. Adverse events and patient and vaccine characteristics were abstracted. Adverse event collection and reporting was evaluated by using the McHarm scale. We were unable to pool results. Strength of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or insufficient.
RESULTS: Of 20 478 titles identified, 67 were included. Strength of evidence was high for measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine and febrile seizures; the varicella vaccine was associated with complications in immunodeficient individuals. There is strong evidence that MMR vaccine is not associated with autism. There is moderate evidence that rotavirus vaccines are associated with intussusception. Limitations of the study include that the majority of studies did not investigate or identify risk factors for AEs; and the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported.
CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious AEs; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide.","['Maglione MA', 'Das L', 'Raaen L', 'Smith A', 'Chari R', 'Newberry S', 'Shanman R', 'Perry T', 'Goetz MB', 'Gidengil C']",2014,134,2,Pediatrics,"Maglione MA, et al.

25081072,[Natural killer cell cytotoxic activity in critical pediatric patients with suspected hemophagocytic syndrome].,"AIM: To determine the role of natural killer (NK) cytotoxic activity in patients with suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (HLH).
DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted from September 2008 to February 2014.
SCOPE: The study was carried out in the Hematological Oncology Laboratory of Hospital Infantil Universitario Niño Jesús, Madrid (Spain).
PATIENTS: We analyzed 30 peripheral blood samples from intensive care patients with suspected HLH. There were 18 males and 12 females, with a mean age of 4.7 years (range 0.2-22). NK cell cytotoxicity was compared with healthy controls according to age and sex.
INTERVENTION: In vitro NK cell cytotoxicity against the K562 cell line was determined by time-resolved fluorescence (Europium-TDA) under resting conditions, after interleukin 15 stimulation, and following block with Fas ligand antibody.
VARIABLE OF INTEREST: NK cell cytotoxicity.
RESULTS: A total of 20 patients showed a significant decrease of NK cell activity compared with controls (P=.001). Nine of these patients were diagnosed with primary HLH. A total of 10 patients were diagnosed with secondary HLH. Cytotoxic activity was normal in 10 subjects. None of them were diagnosed with HLH. Interleukin 15 stimulation increased NK cell cytotoxicity in secondary HLH, and blocking Fas ligand on NK cells decreased cytotoxic activity in primary HLH patients (P=.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, NK cell cytotoxic activity measured by time-resolved fluorescence is a simple and useful clinical diagnostic test for HLH. Interleukin 15 stimulation and Fas ligand blocking on NK cells could help differentiate between primary and secondary HLH.","['Martínez I', 'Fernández L', 'Valentín J', 'Castillo C', 'Chamorro C', 'Pérez-Martínez A']",2015,39,4,Med Intensiva,"Martínez I, et al.

25071735,Varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein expression differentially induces the unfolded protein response in infected cells.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpesvirus that spreads to children as varicella or chicken pox. The virus then establishes latency in the nervous system and re-emerges, typically decades later, as zoster or shingles. We have reported previously that VZV induces autophagy in infected cells as well as exhibiting evidence of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR): XBP1 splicing, a greatly expanded Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and CHOP expression. Herein we report the results of a UPR specific PCR array that measures the levels of mRNA of 84 different components of the UPR in VZV infected cells as compared to tunicamycin treated cells as a positive control and uninfected, untreated cells as a negative control. Tunicamycin is a mixture of chemicals that inhibits N-linked glycosylation in the ER with resultant protein misfolding and the UPR. We found that VZV differentially induces the UPR when compared to tunicamycin treatment. For example, tunicamycin treatment moderately increased (8-fold) roughly half of the array elements while downregulating only three (one ERAD and two FOLD components). VZV infection on the other hand upregulated 33 components including a little described stress sensor CREB-H (64-fold) as well as ER membrane components INSIG and gp78, which modulate cholesterol synthesis while downregulating over 20 components mostly associated with ERAD and FOLD. We hypothesize that this expression pattern is associated with an expanding ER with downregulation of active degradation by ERAD and apoptosis as the cell attempts to handle abundant viral glycoprotein synthesis.","['Carpenter JE', 'Grose C']",2014,5,,Front Microbiol,Carpenter JE and Grose C.

25063723,Central nervous system complications of varicella-zoster virus.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the spectrum of central nervous system complications of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in children admitted to The Hospital for Sick Children between January 1999 and December 2012.
STUDY DESIGN: Children aged 1 month to 18 years (n = 84) admitted with neurologic manifestations associated with a characteristic VZV rash or a confirmatory laboratory test (positive lesion scraping or cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction) were included in the study. Acute neurologic complications were included if they occurred within 4 weeks of VZV infection. Stroke was considered related to VZV if it occurred within 6 months of VZV infection, the neuroimaging was characteristic, and other causes were excluded.
RESULTS: Clinical syndromes included acute cerebellar ataxia (n = 26), encephalitis (n = 17), isolated seizures (n = 16), stroke (n = 10), meningitis (n = 10), Guillain-Barré syndrome (n = 2), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n = 2), and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (n = 1). In those with acute complications (nonstroke), neurologic symptoms occurred a median of 5 days after rash onset (range -6 to +16). The time between rash onset and stroke ranged from 2 weeks to 26 weeks (median 16.0 weeks). Three children with encephalitis died. Residual neurologic sequelae at one year occurred in 9 of 39 (23%) of children with follow-up data. Only 4 children were reported to have received the varicella vaccine.
CONCLUSION: Neurologic complications of VZV infection continue to occur despite the availability of an effective vaccine. Neurologic symptom onset can predate the appearance of the VZV exanthem and in rare cases may occur in the absence of an exanthem.","['Science M', 'MacGregor D', 'Richardson SE', 'Mahant S', 'Tran D', 'Bitnun A']",2014,165,4,J Pediatr,"Science M, et al.

25062334,Herpes zoster stromal keratitis after varicella vaccine booster in a pediatric patient.,"PURPOSE: In this study, the case of a healthy pediatric patient who presented with herpes zoster (HZ) stromal keratitis after vaccination with live attenuated varicella vaccine (Varivax) and subsequent booster is described.
METHOD: This is a retrospective case review.
RESULTS: A 6-year-old girl with no medical history presented with HZ ophthalmicus and stromal keratitis. She had received the original Varivax vaccine at 1 year of age and a booster 1 year before presentation. Topical prednisolone acetate was started with subsequent improvement in inflammation and visual acuity. However, the patient was unable to be completely tapered off the steroids because of reactivation.
CONCLUSIONS: HZ ophthalmicus with stromal keratitis is a rare but potentially damaging manifestation of the varicella zoster virus in the pediatric population. Long-term data regarding reactivation rates in the post-vaccination era are still limited. Close follow-up is needed to ensure resolution of the infiltrates, and reactivation may require long-term steroid therapy.","['Krall P', 'Kubal A']",2014,33,9,Cornea,Krall P and Kubal A.

A 49-year-old woman presented with fever and rash for 3 days. Blood examination revealed marked thrombocytopenia (2.7 × 10(4)/μL). Varicella infection was diagnosed after elevated levels of varicella zoster virus IgM and IgG antibodies were observed 2 weeks later. In this case, thrombocytopenia was due to varicella infection, and the mechanism was estimated to be non-immunological. Because varicella infection complicated by thrombocytopenia may result in fatal bleeding, thrombocytopenia in patients with varicella warrants close attention.","['Shibusawa M', 'Motomura S', 'Hidai H', 'Tsutsumi H', 'Fujita A']",2014,67,4,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Shibusawa M, et al.

Current treatments are acyclovir (ACV) and its derivatives, foscarnet and brivudine (BVdU). Additional antiviral compounds with increased potency and specificity are needed to treat VZV, especially to treat post-herpetic neuralgia. We evaluated β-l-1-[5-(E-2-bromovinyl)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-(dioxolan-4-yl)] uracil (l-BHDU, 1) and 5'-O-valyl-l-BHDU (2) in three models of VZV replication: primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), skin organ culture (SOC) and in SCID-Hu mice with skin xenografts. The efficacy of l-BHDU in vivo and its drug-drug interactions were previously not known. In HFFs, 200μM l-BHDU was noncytotoxic over 3days, and l-BHDU treatment reduced VZV genome copy number and cell to cell spread. The EC50 in HFFs for l-BHDU and valyl-l-BHDU were 0.22 and 0.03μM, respectively. However, l-BHDU antagonized the activity of ACV, BVdU and foscarnet in cultured cells. Given its similar structure to BVdU, we asked if l-BHDU, like BVdU, inhibits 5-fluorouracil catabolism. BALB/c mice were treated with 5-FU alone or in combination with l-BHDU or BVdU. l-BHDU did not interfere with 5-FU catabolism. In SCID-Hu mice implanted with human skin xenografts, l-BHDU and valyl-l-BHDU were superior to ACV and valacyclovir. The maximum concentration (Cmax) levels of l-BHDU were determined in mouse and human tissues at 2h after dosing, and comparison of concentration ratios of tissue to plasma indicated saturation of uptake at the highest dose. For the first time, an l-nucleoside analog, l-BHDU, was found to be effective and well tolerated in mice.","['De C', 'Liu D', 'Zheng B', 'Singh US', 'Chavre S', 'White C', 'Arnold RD', 'Hagen FK', 'Chu CK', 'Moffat JF']",2014,110,,Antiviral Res,"De C, et al. β-l-1-[5-(E-2-bromovinyl)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-(dioxolan-4-yl)] uracil (l-BHDU) prevents varicella-zoster virus replication in a SCID-Hu mouse model and does not interfere with 5-fluorouracil catabolism. β-l-1-[5-(E-2-bromovinyl)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-(dioxolan-4-yl)] uracil (l-BHDU) prevents varicella-zoster virus replication in a SCID-Hu mouse model and does not interfere with 5-fluorouracil catabolism. 2014; 110:10-9. doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.07.007",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25051026/
25046553,Vaccine-associated varicella and rubella infections in severe combined immunodeficiency with isolated CD4 lymphocytopenia and mutations in IL7R detected by tandem whole exome sequencing and chromosomal microarray.,"In areas without newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), disease-defining infections may lead to diagnosis, and in some cases, may not be identified prior to the first year of life. We describe a female infant who presented with disseminated vaccine-acquired varicella (VZV) and vaccine-acquired rubella infections at 13 months of age. Immunological evaluations demonstrated neutropenia, isolated CD4 lymphocytopenia, the presence of CD8(+) T cells, poor lymphocyte proliferation, hypergammaglobulinaemia and poor specific antibody production to VZV infection and routine immunizations. A combination of whole exome sequencing and custom-designed chromosomal microarray with exon coverage of primary immunodeficiency genes detected compound heterozygous mutations (one single nucleotide variant and one intragenic copy number variant involving one exon) within the IL7R gene. Mosaicism for wild-type allele (20-30%) was detected in pretransplant blood and buccal DNA and maternal engraftment (5-10%) demonstrated in pretransplant blood DNA. This may be responsible for the patient's unusual immunological phenotype compared to classical interleukin (IL)-7Rα deficiency. Disseminated VZV was controlled with anti-viral and immune-based therapy, and umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation was successful. Retrospectively performed T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analyses completed on neonatal Guthrie cards identified absent TREC. This case emphasizes the danger of live viral vaccination in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) patients and the importance of newborn screening to identify patients prior to high-risk exposures. It also illustrates the value of aggressive pathogen identification and treatment, the influence newborn screening can have on morbidity and mortality and the significant impact of newer genomic diagnostic tools in identifying the underlying genetic aetiology for SCID patients.","['Bayer DK', 'Martinez CA', 'Sorte HS', 'Forbes LR', 'Demmler-Harrison GJ', 'Hanson IC', 'Pearson NM', 'Noroski LM', 'Zaki SR', 'Bellini WJ', 'Leduc MS', 'Yang Y', 'Eng CM', 'Patel A', 'Rodningen OK', 'Muzny DM', 'Gibbs RA', 'Campbell IM', 'Shaw CA', 'Baker MW', 'Zhang V', 'Lupski JR', 'Orange JS', 'Seeborg FO', 'Stray-Pedersen A']",2014,178,3,Clin Exp Immunol,"Bayer DK, et al.

25046399,Development of an IFN-γ ELISpot assay to assess varicella-zoster virus-specific cell-mediated immunity following umbilical cord blood transplantation.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). For this reason, antiherpetic prophylaxis is administrated systematically to pediatric UCBT recipients to prevent complications associated with VZV infection, but there is no strong, evidence based consensus that defines its optimal duration. Because T cell mediated immunity is responsible for the control of VZV infection, assessing the reconstitution of VZV specific T cell responses following UCBT could provide indications as to whether prophylaxis should be maintained or can be discontinued. To this end, a VZV specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay was developed to characterize IFN-γ production by T lymphocytes in response to in vitro stimulation with irradiated live attenuated VZV vaccine. This assay provides a rapid, reproducible and sensitive measurement of VZV specific cell mediated immunity suitable for monitoring the reconstitution of VZV specific immunity in a clinical setting and assessing immune responsiveness to VZV antigens.  ","['Salem Fourati I', 'Grenier AJ', 'Jolette É', 'Merindol N', 'Ovetchkine P', 'Soudeyns H']",2014,,89,J Vis Exp,"Salem Fourati I, et al.

25036047,"Incidence of pneumococcal and varicella disease in HIV-infected children and adolescents in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 1996-2011.","BACKGROUND: To define the burden of hospitalization due to 2 vaccine-preventable infections, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and varicella zoster (VZ), among HIV-infected children in the UK and Ireland.
METHODS: Analysis of hospitalizations of HIV-infected children <18 years receiving pediatric care and reported to the Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study (CHIPS) between 1996 and 2011.
RESULTS: Admissions for IPD and VZ combined accounted for ~5% of all hospital admissions for HIV-infected children each year. When compared with background rates for healthy children, the admission rate ratio for HIV-infected children on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) was 16.7, 14.8 and 126.7 for IPD, varicella and herpes zoster, respectively, and 156.7, 86.1 and 470, respectively, for HIV-infected children not on cART. Those admitted with IPD or VZ were more likely to have Centers for Disease Control stage B/C at presentation with HIV than those without such admissions (36.8% for IPD, 29.7% for VZ and 22.1% for no IPD or VZ, P = 0.006), and were more likely to subsequently commence cART (94.7%, 91.3% and 80.2% respectively, P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear increased risk of admission with IPD or VZ in HIV-infected compared with uninfected children, magnified in those who have not yet commenced cART. It is anticipated that the introduction of new guidelines will result in improved vaccine uptake and thereby reduce the burden of IPD and VZ disease. Subsequent evaluation will assess the impact of these guidelines.","['Payne H', 'Judd A', 'Donegan K', 'Okike IO', 'Ladhani SN', 'Doerholt K', 'Heath PT']",2015,34,2,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Payne H, et al.

25030069,[Stroke in children. Experience in an emergency service].,"AIMS: To describe the characteristics of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in patients treated in a paediatric emergency department and to detect clinical differences, depending on whether the condition was ischaemic or haemorrhagic.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: An analytical, observation-based, retrospective study was conducted in the paediatric emergency department of a tertiary care hospital. The sample included patients aged between 1 month and 18 years who were treated in the service over a period of 10 years (January 2001 to December 2011) with a final diagnosis of CVD. Haemorrhages due to traumatic injury or secondary to tumours, thrombosis of the venous sinuses and patients who were not treated in the service were all excluded.
RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 61 patients, 39 (63.9%) of whom were males, with a mean age of 4.6 years (range: 1.3 months-17.5 years). Of them, 26 (42.6%) presented ischaemic CVD and 35 (57.4%) had haemorrhagic CVD. Headache (n = 20; 57.1%; p = 0.008) and vomiting (n = 25; 71.4%; p = 0.001) are more frequent in haemorrhagic CVD, and hemiparesis (n = 17; 65.4%; p < 0.001) and facial palsy (n = 7; 26.9%; p = 0.001) in ischaemic CVD. The main causes of haemorrhagic CVD are arteriovenous malformations (n = 17; 38.6%) and the ischaemic ones are triggered by arteriopathies (n = 6; 42.3%). On discharge from hospital, 27 (44.3%) presented different degrees of disability and 6 (9.8%) died.
CONCLUSIONS: CVD is a rare entity, although it presents a high morbidity and mortality rate. Haemorrhagic CVD is seen to predominate slightly and it is observed how haemorrhagic CVD presents more often with signs of intracranial hypertension, while the ischaemic form tends to have more neurological focus.","['Huici-Sánchez M', 'Escuredo-Argullós L', 'Trenchs-Sáinz de la Maza V', 'Luaces-Cubells C']",2014,59,3,Rev Neurol,"Huici-Sánchez M, et al.

25009579,Computational modeling of interventions and protective thresholds to prevent disease transmission in deploying populations.,"Military personnel are deployed abroad for missions ranging from humanitarian relief efforts to combat actions; delay or interruption in these activities due to disease transmission can cause operational disruptions, significant economic loss, and stressed or exceeded military medical resources. Deployed troops function in environments favorable to the rapid and efficient transmission of many viruses particularly when levels of protection are suboptimal. When immunity among deployed military populations is low, the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks increases, impacting troop readiness and achievement of mission objectives. However, targeted vaccination and the optimization of preexisting immunity among deployed populations can decrease the threat of outbreaks among deployed troops. Here we describe methods for the computational modeling of disease transmission to explore how preexisting immunity compares with vaccination at the time of deployment as a means of preventing outbreaks and protecting troops and mission objectives during extended military deployment actions. These methods are illustrated with five modeling case studies for separate diseases common in many parts of the world, to show different approaches required in varying epidemiological settings.","['Burgess C', 'Peace A', 'Everett R', 'Allegri B', 'Garman P']",2014,2014,,Comput Math Methods Med,"Burgess C, et al.

One of the most sensitive tests for detecting VZV antibodies after vaccination is the fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) test. Unfortunately, this test is labor-intensive, somewhat subjective to read, and not commercially available. Therefore, we developed a highly quantitative and high-throughput luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay to detect antibody to VZV glycoprotein E (gE). Tests of children who received the varicella vaccine showed that the gE LIPS assay had 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity, a viral capsid antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) had 67% and 87% specificity, and a glycoprotein ELISA (not commercially available in the United States) had 94% sensitivity and 74% specificity compared with the FAMA test. The rates of antibody detection by the gE LIPS and glycoprotein ELISA were not statistically different. Therefore, the gE LIPS assay may be useful for detecting VZV antibodies in varicella vaccine recipients. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no.

24954057,Vaccines for post-exposure prophylaxis against varicella (chickenpox) in children and adults.,"BACKGROUND: The prevention of varicella (chickenpox) using live attenuated varicella vaccines has been demonstrated both in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and in population-based immunisation programmes in countries such as the United States and Australia. Many countries do not routinely immunise children against varicella and exposures continue to occur. Although the disease is often mild, complications such as secondary bacterial infection, pneumonitis and encephalitis occur in about 1% of cases, usually leading to hospitalisation. The use of varicella vaccine in persons who have recently been exposed to the varicella zoster virus has been studied as a form of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of vaccines for use as PEP for the prevention of varicella in children and adults.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March week 1, 2014), EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2014) and LILACS (1982 to March 2014). We searched for unpublished trials registered on the clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP websites.
SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs and quasi-RCTs of varicella vaccine for PEP compared with placebo or no intervention. The outcome measures were efficacy in prevention of clinical cases and/or laboratory-confirmed clinical cases and adverse events following vaccination.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted and analysed data using Review Manager software.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified three trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The included trials varied in study quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up and outcomes measured and, as such, were not suitable for meta-analysis. We identified high or unclear risk of bias in two of the three included studies. Overall, 13 out of 56 vaccine recipients (23%) developed varicella compared with 42 out of 54 placebo (or no vaccine) recipients (78%). Of the vaccine recipients who developed varicella, the majority only had mild disease (with fewer than 50 skin lesions). In the three trials, most participants received PEP within three days following exposure; too few participants were vaccinated four to five days post-exposure to ascertain the efficacy of vaccine given more than three days after exposure. No included trial reported on adverse events following immunisation.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: These small trials suggest varicella vaccine administered within three days to children following household contact with a varicella case reduces infection rates and severity of cases. We identified no RCTs for adolescents or adults. Safety was not adequately addressed.","['Macartney K', 'Heywood A', 'McIntyre P']",2014,2014,6,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Macartney K, et al.

24952415,"Antibody levels to tetanus, diphtheria, measles and varicella in patients with primary immunodeficiency undergoing intravenous immunoglobulin therapy: a prospective study.","BACKGROUND: Patients with antibody deficiencies depend on the presence of a variety of antibody specificities in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to ensure continued protection against pathogens. Few studies have examined levels of antibodies to specific pathogens in IVIG preparations and little is known about the specific antibody levels in patients under regular IVIG treatment. The current study determined the range of antibodies to tetanus, diphtheria, measles and varicella in IVIG products and the levels of these antibodies in patients undergoing IVIG treatment.
METHODS: We selected 21 patients with primary antibody deficiencies who were receiving regular therapy with IVIG. Over a period of one year, we collected four blood samples from each patient (every 3 months), immediately before immunoglobulin infusion. We also collected samples from the IVIG preparation the patients received the month prior to blood collection. Antibody levels to tetanus, diphtheria, measles and varicella virus were measured in plasma and IVIG samples. Total IgG levels were determined in plasma samples.
RESULTS: Antibody levels to tetanus, diphtheria, varicella virus and measles showed considerable variation in different IVIG lots, but they were similar when compared between commercial preparations. All patients presented with protective levels of antibodies specific for tetanus, measles and varicella. Some patients had suboptimal diphtheria antibody levels. There was a significant correlation between serum and IVIG antibodies to all pathogens, except tetanus. There was a significant correlation between diphtheria and varicella antibodies with total IgG levels, but there was no significant correlation with antibodies to tetanus or measles.
CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the variation in specific antibody levels between batches of the same brand of IVIG. Apart from the most common infections to which these patients are susceptible, health care providers must be aware of other vaccine preventable diseases, which still exist globally.","['Nobre FA', 'Gonzalez IG', 'Simão RM', 'de Moraes Pinto MI', 'Costa-Carvalho BT']",2014,15,,BMC Immunol,"Nobre FA, et al.

The KiGGS first interview follow-up is a telephone interview study that collected, among other things, data on a number of chronic and vaccine-preventable diseases in 2009-2012 and is a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal study based on a population registry sample from the 167 KiGGS study points. The analysis is based on 12,368 respondents (7913 KiGGS follow-up participants aged 7-17 years, response 72 % and 4455 newly recruited 0- to 6-year-olds, response 42 %). Based on parent reports the lifetime prevalence of both chickenpox and pertussis has decreased in the population targeted by recently changed vaccination recommendations. For measles the prevalence remained unsatisfactorily high in each investigated age group. Of the children and adolescents aged 0-17 years 16 % (95 % confidence interval CI 15.2-17.0 %) had a long-standing chronic health condition according to the parents. Of these, however, only one in five was affected in their routine daily activities. The lifetime prevalence in 7- to 17-year-olds was 1.2 % (0.9-1.6) for epilepsy (0.4 % for the past 12 months), 5.0 % (4.4-5.7) for migraine, 0.2 % (0.1-0.3) for diabetes and in 0 to 6-year-olds 2.0 % (1.5-2.6) for heart conditions and 3.1 % (2.5-3.8) for febrile seizures with a -prevalence in 0 to 2-year-olds which are most affected of 1.0 % (0.6-1.6) in the past 12 months. The vast majority of children and adolescents in Germany are in good or very good health as suggested by other results reported in this issue; however, chronic conditions are not rare and need continuous monitoring. These results confirm that implementation of the vaccination recommendations of the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) can lead to effective prevention of infectious diseases in Germany.","['Neuhauser H', 'Poethko-Müller C', 'KiGGS Study Group']",2014,57,7,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"Neuhauser H, et al.

24942129,Acute cerebellitis in varicella: a ten year case series and systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Acute cerebellitis (AC) is the most common neurological complication of varicella. Nevertheless, it has been scarcely studied. The objective of this study were to asses the occurrence of AC among children hospitalized for varicella and to analyze its specific clinical picture and outcome.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children admitted to the hospital for varicella between 1st October 2003 and 1st June 2013 and we compared our results with literature. Children were all unvaccinated for varicella.
RESULTS: In our case series, AC was found out in 48 out of 457 patients (10.5%). The highest frequency of AC was observed in children from 1 to 5 years of age (60.9%). The most characteristic symptom of AC was a broad-based gait disturbance that progressed gradually over the course of a few days (95.8%). Other common symptoms included slurred speech (37.5%), vomiting (31.25%), headache (29.16%), dysmetry (25%) and tremor (22.91%). After a long hospitalization (median of 11 days), all but one children were dismissed without invalidating sequelae.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study may help to better address the problem of varicella cerebellar complications in hospitalized children and to monitor changes over time caused by an increase in vaccination coverage.","['Bozzola E', 'Bozzola M', 'Tozzi AE', 'Calcaterra V', 'Longo D', 'Krzystofiak A', 'Villani A']",2014,40,,Ital J Pediatr,"Bozzola E, et al.

Due to this, we proposed to discover the serological status for varicella, rubella, mumps and measles in the workers of a tertiary hospital in Madrid.
METHODS: We have conducted a retrospective epidemiological study of 1060 health workers, obtaining information such as age, sex, service area, employment status, pre-exposure vaccination and post-vaccination serology and vaccination status.
RESULTS: In the population studied, 90.1% were protected against varicella, 65.6% against mumps, 95.6% against rubella and 92.9% against measles. There is no better protection against these illnesses for workers who treat patients directly, workers who treat immunosuppressed patients or for workers in services or units with a higher risk of infection.
CONCLUSION: There is no better protection against varicella, rubella, mumps and measles for the workers who have higher risk of infection at work; and the workers who treat patients, that if they suffer these diseases, this could put their health at risk.","['Rodríguez ML', 'Martínez D', 'Santos-Sancho JM', 'Borda JR', 'Orero A']",2014,27,2,Rev Esp Quimioter,"Rodríguez ML, et al.

24932994,"The effects of school holidays on transmission of varicella zoster virus, England and Wales, 1967-2008.","BACKGROUND: Changes in children's contact patterns between termtime and school holidays affect the transmission of several respiratory-spread infections. Transmission of varicella zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox, has also been linked to the school calendar in several settings, but temporal changes in the proportion of young children attending childcare centres may have influenced this relationship.
METHODS: We used two modelling methods (a simple difference equations model and a Time series Susceptible Infectious Recovered (TSIR) model) to estimate fortnightly values of a contact parameter (the per capita rate of effective contact between two specific individuals), using GP consultation data for chickenpox in England and Wales from 1967-2008.
RESULTS: The estimated contact parameters were 22-31% lower during the summer holiday than during termtime. The relationship between the contact parameter and the school calendar did not change markedly over the years analysed.
CONCLUSIONS: In England and Wales, reductions in contact between children during the school summer holiday lead to a reduction in the transmission of VZV. These estimates are relevant for predicting how closing schools and nurseries may affect an outbreak of an emerging respiratory-spread pathogen.","['Jackson C', 'Mangtani P', 'Fine P', 'Vynnycky E']",2014,9,6,PLoS One,"Jackson C, et al.

24932179,Acute retinal necrosis in childhood.,"BACKGROUND: Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a viral syndrome consisting of uveitis/vitritis, occlusive vasculitis and peripheral necrosis. Few incidents are reported in children. The etiology is reactivated herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Treatment with acyclovir is often used. The administration of oral glucocorticosteroids is of unproven benefit. Prognosis is variable but poor.
METHODS: Three weeks after contracting mild chickenpox, a healthy 4-year-old girl developed blurred vision in her right eye. Severely reduced visual acuity was noted, together with anterior uveitis, 'mutton-fat' precipitates and vitral flare. Retinal vasculitis with necrosis was present. Serology for toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus and HIV was negative, while HSV and VZV IgG antibodies were positive. She was treated with 30 mg/kg of intravenous methylprednisolone (3 days), 30 mg of oral prednisone (3 days), and tapering for 8 weeks. Intravenous acyclovir was given for 10 days, followed by oral acyclovir for 4 months. Aspirin (100 mg/day) was given for 4 months.
RESULTS: At 12 months, the girl felt good. Her right eye acuity was 6/9, with an intraocular pressure of 17 mm Hg. The peripheral retina showed scarring but no detachment.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a once-daily high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy in one of the youngest known ARN cases. Pulsed steroid therapy was based on its known effectiveness in vasculitis, which is the main pathophysiology in ARN. There was no evidence of steroid-related viral over-replication. Our case achieved an excellent clinical and ophthalmic recovery in spite of the poor prognosis. The positive result of this case report provides a basis for further evaluation of high-dose steroid pulse therapy in ARN.","['Pikkel YY', 'Pikkel J']",2014,5,2,Case Rep Ophthalmol,Pikkel YY and Pikkel J.

24919344,[Pregnancy and vaccinoprevention].,"Vaccinations protect woman and her fetus against different infectious diseases, but their application on pregnant should be extremely responsible. In this review I present information about some infectious diseases and vaccines during pregnancy. Women, planning to get pregnant should be advised to do serological tests in order to find out their immune status against some infections, leading to fetal congenital malformations (rubella, chicken pox, hepatitis B) and if necessary to get vaccinated at least a month before pregnancy. Despite the lack of vaccines against Cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus 19 and Toxoplasma gondii it is good to know woman's immune status against these infections in order to clarify the clinical approach in case of future contact with sick or carriers. Parvovirus 19 could cause fetal death, while CMV could be transmitted to the child. Immune women wouldn't get sick and wouldn't transmit Toxoplasmagondii to the fetus during pregnancy. Recommended vaccines before pregnancy include vaccines against flu, human papilloma virus, MMR (morbilli, measles, rubella), Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough), chicken pox. CDC-Atlanta recommends during pregnancy two vaccines--against flu, in case it wasn't done before pregnancy, and Tdap during every pregnancy between 27-th and 36-th gestation week. Whooping cough is very dangerous for the baby during the first two months after birth, while it is not yet vaccinated. From this point of view it is of best interest of the mother to have strong immunity in order to transfer antibodies during breastfeeding, as well as for the father and the rest who will take care for the newborn child to be vaccinated against whooping cough. During pregnancy vaccinations against tuberculosis, morbilli, measles, rubella, meningococcal disease, typhoid fever and chicken pox are contraindicated. In case of contact vaccinations against rabies, anthrax, small pox, poliomyelitis and yellow fever should be taken into consideration. Immediately after birth, if the vaccination against whooping cough is missed young mother vaccination is recommended. The vaccination is one of the greatest achievements of the modern medicine, but it is still an object of vigorous attacks, concerning used products safety. One of the most spreading fears is about sterility after vaccination. Over a period of three years (2009-2012) 563 women were vaccinated by SACMEH against HPV. Forty two of them (13.40%) interrupt vaccination due to pregnancy (18 of them after the first shot and 24 after the second shot). Our observations show, that this vaccine is carried out good by the patients, tit is safe and does not cause sterility.","['Galev A', 'Nacheva A']",2014,53,1,Akush Ginekol (Sofiia),Galev A and Nacheva A.

24914115,Risk of febrile seizures after first dose of measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine: a population-based cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: The combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine currently used in Canada (Priorix-Tetra) may increase the risk of febrile seizures relative to the separate vaccines (MMR and varicella) previously administered. We determined the risk of febrile seizure after the first dose of MMRV, as well as any additional risk for children at high risk for seizures because of pre-existing medical conditions.
METHODS: In this retrospective, population-based cohort study, we compared the risk of seizures after the first dose of MMRV with the risk after same-day administration of separate MMR and varicella vaccines (MMR+V) in children 12 to 23 months of age in the province of Alberta. We deterministically linked vaccination data to health service utilization data for seizures. We used Poisson regression, with adjustment for age and calendar year, to determine the risk for the full cohort and for high-risk children.
RESULTS: The risk of seizures 7 to 10 days after vaccination was twice as high with MMRV as with MMR+V (relative risk [RR] 1.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-3.05). The excess absolute risk of seizures was 3.52 seizures per 10 000 doses of MMRV relative to MMR+V. In high-risk children, the risk was not differentially higher for MMRV (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.60-2.79).
INTERPRETATION: Despite an increased risk of febrile seizures following MMRV (compared with MMR+V), the absolute level of risk was small. Policy-makers need to balance these findings with the potential benefits of administering the combination vaccine or determine whether the choice of vaccine rests with clinicians and/or parents.","['MacDonald SE', 'Dover DC', 'Simmonds KA', 'Svenson LW']",2014,186,11,CMAJ,"MacDonald SE, et al.

24913796,Impact of vaccination on the epidemiology of varicella: 1995-2009.,"BACKGROUND: When varicella vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1995, there were concerns that childhood vaccination might increase the number of adolescents susceptible to varicella and shift disease toward older age groups where it can be more severe.
METHODS: We conducted a series of 5 cross-sectional studies in 1994 to 1995 (prevaccine), 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California to assess changes in varicella epidemiology in children and adolescents, as well as changes in varicella hospitalization in people of all ages. For each study, information on varicella history and varicella occurrence during the past year was obtained by telephone survey from a sample of ∼8000 members 5 to 19 years old; varicella hospitalization rates were calculated for the entire membership.
RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2009, the overall incidence of varicella in 5- to 19-year-olds decreased from 25.8 to 1.3 per 1000 person-years, a ∼90% to 95% decline in the various age categories (5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 years of age). The proportion of varicella-susceptible children and adolescents also decreased in all age groups, including in 15- to 19-year-olds (from 15.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2009). From 1994 to 2009, age-adjusted varicella hospitalization rates in the general member population decreased from 2.13 to 0.25 per 100,000, a ∼90% decline.
CONCLUSIONS: In the 15 years after the introduction of varicella vaccine, a major reduction in varicella incidence and hospitalization was observed with no evidence of a shift in the burden of varicella to older age groups.","['Baxter R', 'Tran TN', 'Ray P', 'Lewis E', 'Fireman B', 'Black S', 'Shinefield HR', 'Coplan PM', 'Saddier P']",2014,134,1,Pediatrics,"Baxter R, et al.

24911894,Two-dose varicella vaccine effectiveness and rash severity in outbreaks of varicella among public school students.,"BACKGROUND: Universal 2-dose varicella vaccination was recommended in 2006 to further reduce varicella disease burden. This study examined 2-dose varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE) and rash severity in the setting of school-associated varicella outbreaks.
METHODS: A case control study was conducted from January 2010 to May 2011 in all West Virginia public schools. Clinically diagnosed cases from varicella outbreaks were matched with classmate controls. Vaccination information was collected from school, health department and healthcare provider immunization information systems.
RESULTS: Among the 133 cases and 365 controls enrolled, VE against all varicella was 83.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 69.2%-90.8%] for 1-dose of varicella vaccine and 93.9% (95% CI: 86.9%-97.1%) for 2-dose; the incremental VE (2-dose vs. 1-dose) was 63.6% (95% CI: 32.6%-80.3%). In preventing moderate/severe varicella, 1-dose varicella vaccine was 88.2% (95% CI: 72.7%- 94.9%) effective, and 2-dose vaccination was 97.5% (95% CI: 91.6%-99.2%) effective, with the incremental VE of 78.6% (95% CI: 40.9%-92.3%). One-dose VE declined along with time since vaccination (VE = 93.0%, 88.0% and 81.8% in <5, 5-9 and ≥ 10 years after vaccination, P = 0.001 for trend). Both 1- and 2-dose breakthrough cases had milder rash than unvaccinated cases (<50 lesion: 24.6%, 49.1% and 70.0% in unvaccinated, 1-dose and 2-dose cases, P < 0.001), and no severe disease was found in 2-dose cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-dose varicella vaccination is highly effective and confers higher protection than a 1-dose regimen. High 2-dose varicella vaccination coverage should maximize the benefits of the varicella vaccination program and further reduce varicella disease burden in the United States.","['Thomas CA', 'Shwe T', 'Bixler D', 'del Rosario M', 'Grytdal S', 'Wang C', 'Haddy LE', 'Bialek SR']",2014,33,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Thomas CA, et al.

24863663,[Varicella-zoster virus and pregnancy].,"The incidence of varicella is low in pregnant women, and estimated around 1/1000 pregnancies. Vaccination is the cornerstone of prevention, but is contraindicated during pregnancy. Varicella is more severe in pregnant women. The risk of viral pneumonia is not increased, but VZV-associated pneumonia is usually more severe in pregnant women. Infection between 0-20 WG is associated with a 2 % risk of congenital varicella syndrome. Infection between D-5 and D+2 of delivery is associated with high risk of severe neonatal infection. Non-immune pregnant women with significant exposure to VZV require post-exposure prophylaxis with specific anti-VZV immunoglobulins that should be administered ideally within 4 days post-exposure and maximum within 10 days of exposure. Anti-VZV immunoglobulins are available in France in the context of an approved expanded access to an investigational new drug. Pregnant women with varicella should receive within 24 hours antiviral treatment based either on valaciclovir or, in case of severe infection, intravenous aciclovir. Both drugs were shown safe during pregnancy, even during the first trimester. Neonates born from mothers who developed varicella between D-5 and D+2 of delivery should also receive as soon as possible specific anti-VZV immunoglobulins.","['Charlier C', 'Le Mercier D', 'Salomon LJ', 'Ville Y', 'Kermorvant-Duchemin E', 'Frange P', 'Postaire M', 'Lortholary O', 'Lecuit M', 'Leruez-Ville M']",2014,43,6 Pt 1,Presse Med,"Charlier C, et al.

24841633,Simple technique for in field samples collection in the cases of skin rash illness and subsequent PCR detection of orthopoxviruses and varicella zoster virus.,"BACKGROUND: In case of outbreak of rash illness in remote areas, clinically discriminating monkeypox (MPX) from severe form of chickenpox and from smallpox remains a concern for first responders.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was therefore to use MPX and chickenpox outbreaks in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as a test case for establishing a rapid and specific diagnosis in affected remote areas.
METHODS: In 2008 and 2009, successive outbreaks of presumed MPX skin rash were reported in Bena Tshiadi, Yangala and Ndesha healthcare districts of the West Kasai province (DRC). Specimens consisting of liquid vesicle dried on filter papers or crusted scabs from healing patients were sampled by first responders. A field analytical facility was deployed nearby in order to carry out a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay using genus consensus primers, consensus orthopoxvirus (OPV) and smallpox-specific probes spanning over the 14 kD fusion protein encoding gene. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used on-site as backup method to confirm the presence of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in samples. To complete the differential diagnosis of skin rash, chickenpox was tested in parallel using a commercial qPCR assay. In a post-deployment step, a MPXV-specific pyrosequencing was carried out on all biotinylated amplicons generated on-site in order to confirm the on-site results.
RESULTS: Whereas MPXV proved to be the agent causing the rash illness outbreak in the Bena Tshiadi, VZV was the causative agent of the disease in Yangala and Ndesha districts. In addition, each on-site result was later confirmed by MPXV-specific pyrosequencing analysis without any discrepancy.
CONCLUSION: This experience of rapid on-site dual use DNA-based differential diagnosis of rash illnesses demonstrates the potential of combining tests specifically identifying bioterrorism agents and agents causing natural outbreaks. This opens the way to rapid on-site DNA-based identification of a broad spectrum of causative agents in remote areas.","['Dumont C', 'Irenge LM', 'Magazani EK', 'Garin D', 'Muyembe JJ', 'Bentahir M', 'Gala JL']",2014,9,5,PLoS One,"Dumont C, et al.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus-associated ophthalmoplegia is well documented. Very rarely, herpes zoster and chickenpox cause external ophthalmoplegia. A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with chickenpox and treated with intravenous acyclovir. He suddenly reported diplopia and restricted left eye movement. MRI of the orbit revealed thickening and abnormal contrast enhancement of the preseptal space and lateral rectus muscle of the left eye. In this case, external ophthalmoplegia occurred following chickenpox with radiological evidence of orbital myositis.

24819870,Update on varicella zoster virus vasculopathy.,"Primary infection of humans with varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), after which the virus becomes latent in cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia and autonomic ganglia along the entire neuraxis. As VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity declines in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, VZV reactivates from one or more ganglia and typically causes herpes zoster (shingles). Zoster may also be complicated by VZV vasculopathy due to productive virus infection of the cerebral arteries. In recent decades, the clinical spectrum of VZV vasculopathy has expanded to include not only transient ischemic attacks and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, but also multifocal VZV vasculopathy, with temporal artery infection mimicking giant cell arteritis, extracranial vasculopathy, aneurysm with and without subarachnoid hemorrhage, arterial dissection and dolichoectasia, ischemic cranial neuropathies, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, spinal cord infarction and peripheral thrombotic disease.","['Nagel MA', 'Gilden D']",2014,16,6,Curr Infect Dis Rep,Nagel MA and Gilden D.

24804006,Tuberculosis: medico-legal aspects.,"Tuberculosis is a diffusive infectious disease whose typical behaviour differentiates it from other infectious diseases spread by human-to-human transmission (flu, chicken pox, cholera, etc.) that follow a classic epidemic pattern. Indeed, in the presence of a known source of Koch bacilli that is capable of spreading the bacteria by air, not all exposed individuals inhale the bacteria, not all those who inhale them absorb them, not all those who absorb the bacteria are unable to eliminate them, not all who are able to eliminate them do so using delayed hypersensitivity, not all those who react with delayed hypersensitivity suffer lasting tissue damage (among other things, minor), not all who suffer tissue damage have anatomical sequelae, and not all those who have anatomical sequelae, however minimal, become carriers of bacilli in the latent period. The vast majority (90-95%) of the latter - which are in any case a portion, not the totality of those exposed - remain asymptomatic throughout their lives and never develop active tuberculosis. Based on these biological characteristics and the legal concepts of ""epidemic"" and ""disease,"" it becomes highly problematic, if not impossible, to assert both that tuberculosis can cause events of sufficient magnitude to be associated with the crime of ""epidemic,"" and that the mere diagnosis of a latent tuberculosis infection is sufficient to assume the presence of an illness legally prosecutable in criminal proceedings or a disability prosecutable in civil proceedings. Furthermore, clinically apparent tuberculosis is a temporarily-and in some cases permanently-disabling condition, and in certain work environments, even with the difficulties caused by the lack of available effective diagnostic tools and the insidious behaviour of the disease in the early stages, targeted monitoring to identify other persons who may become ill is appropriate.","['Vetrugno G', 'De-Giorgio F', ""D'Alessandro F"", 'Scafetta I', 'Berloco F', 'Buonsenso D', 'Abbate F', 'Scalise G', 'Pascali VL', 'Valentini P']",2014,6,1,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,"Vetrugno G, et al.

24793952,"Differential loss of humoral immunity against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella-zoster virus in children treated for cancer.","BACKGROUND: Intensive chemotherapy in children with cancer results in long-term impairment of humoral immunity. Whereas most studies to date focused on children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), little data have been published on patients suffering from Hodgkin disease or from solid tumors. We therefore analyzed the loss of protective immunity (defined as immunity at the time of diagnosis and lack of immunity after completion of therapy) against vaccine-preventable diseases in children treated for various malignancies.
METHODS: Children and adolescents <21 years of age at diagnosis and treated between 2001 and 2010 for various malignancies in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Frankfurt, were included in the retrospective chart review. Antibody levels against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella-zoster-virus (VZV) were routinely assessed at the time of diagnosis and within 12 months after completion of therapy.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 195 children (122 male); 80 patients had ALL, 15 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 18 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 22 Hodgkin disease, and 60 various solid tumors. Overall, 27%, 47%, 19%, and 17% of the patients lost their humoral immunity against measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV, respectively. The risk of losing protective antibody titers depended on age with a higher risk in younger children. The loss of protective humoral immunity occurred significantly more often in patients with ALL compared to patients with any other underlying malignant disease (hematological malignancies such AML and NHL, Hodgkin disease or solid tumors).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that a significant number of children lose pre-existing humoral immunity against measles, mumps, rubella, and VZV after completion of chemotherapy. This loss occurs more often in children with ALL than in children with AML, solid tumors and Hodgkin disease. Our results underline the need for post-chemotherapy revaccination of childhood cancer survivors.","['Bochennek K', 'Allwinn R', 'Langer R', 'Becker M', 'Keppler OT', 'Klingebiel T', 'Lehrnbecher T']",2014,32,27,Vaccine,"Bochennek K, et al.

Data from the Immunization Information System and the Infectious Disease Reporting System demonstrated that in Beijing's Fengtai District, the varicella breakthrough rate increased from 0.7% in 2008 to 2.5% in 2012 and showed an increased trend (P<0.001). Among the varicella cases in children (age of 3-15 years), the number of breakthrough cases increased from 167 in 2008 to 622 in 2012, which was 45.2% (n=1735) of the total child cases (n=3842). From 2008 to 2012, a total of 62 outbreaks occurred; among the 787 affected child outbreak cases, 61% were vaccinated.

24791730,Low varicella-related consultation rate in the Netherlands in primary care data.,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, a relatively low varicella disease burden compared to other European countries is observed within routine surveillance. To validate this, we estimated the varicella-related consultation rate using The Integrated Primary Care Information database.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, varicella patients in 2006-2008 were identified by the International Classification of Primary Care (A72) and free text in the electronic medical records, and manually reviewed to be categorised as 'varicella' or 'probable varicella'. The incidence of GP-consultation, specialist referral, emergency department contact and hospitalisation due to varicella was calculated, standardised to the Dutch population.
RESULTS: We identified 1881 varicella cases (2348 including probable cases), 14 patients were hospitalised. The overall incidence of GP-consultation due to varicella per 100,000 person-years was at least 281 (95%CI 268-294) and when probable cases were also included at maximum 354 (95%CI 340-369). The overall incidence of specialist referral, emergency department contact and hospitalisation per 100,000 person-years was 3.9 (95%CI 2.7-5.6), 2.5 (95%CI 1.5-4.0) and 2.0 (95%CI 1.2-3.4) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the relatively low disease burden due to varicella in the Netherlands. In this study, using primary care data, similar incidences of GP consultation and referral to secondary care due to varicella were found as in routine surveillance. The lower varicella-related consultation rate might be linked to more conservative GP consultation behaviour in the Netherlands, and the relatively young age of infection. This is highly relevant for the decision-making process whether or not to introduce universal childhood varicella vaccination in the Netherlands.","['van Lier A', 'van Erp J', 'Donker GA', 'van der Maas NA', 'Sturkenboom MC', 'de Melker HE']",2014,32,28,Vaccine,"van Lier A, et al.

In the current report, he presented during an on-going chicken pox outbreak and survived with no significant complications. A breakthrough varicella virus re-infection or a reactivation is possible, both of which could present as zoster.

Using TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) analysis, expression levels of miRNAs in serum samples from 29 patients with varicella and 60 patients with Bordetella pertussis (BP), measles virus (MEV) and enterovirus (EV) were analyzed. The array results showed that 247 miRNAs were differentially expressed in sera of the varicella patients compared with healthy controls (215 up-regulated and 32 down-regulated). Through the following qRT-PCR confirmation and receiver operational characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, five miRNAs (miR-197, miR-629, miR-363, miR-132 and miR-122) were shown to distinguish varicella patients from healthy controls and other microbial infections with moderate sensitivity and specificity. A number of significantly enriched pathways regulated by these circulating miRNAs were predicted, and some of them were involved in inflammatory response, nervous system and respiratory system development. Our results, for the first time, revealed that a number of miRNAs were differentially expressed during VZV infection, and these five serum miRNAs have great potential to serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis of VZV infection in varicella patients.","['Qi Y', 'Zhu Z', 'Shi Z', 'Ge Y', 'Zhao K', 'Zhou M', 'Cui L']",2014,6,4,Viruses,"Qi Y, et al.

24743387,Active learning to understand infectious disease models and improve policy making.,"Modeling plays a major role in policy making, especially for infectious disease interventions but such models can be complex and computationally intensive. A more systematic exploration is needed to gain a thorough systems understanding. We present an active learning approach based on machine learning techniques as iterative surrogate modeling and model-guided experimentation to systematically analyze both common and edge manifestations of complex model runs. Symbolic regression is used for nonlinear response surface modeling with automatic feature selection. First, we illustrate our approach using an individual-based model for influenza vaccination. After optimizing the parameter space, we observe an inverse relationship between vaccination coverage and cumulative attack rate reinforced by herd immunity. Second, we demonstrate the use of surrogate modeling techniques on input-response data from a deterministic dynamic model, which was designed to explore the cost-effectiveness of varicella-zoster virus vaccination. We use symbolic regression to handle high dimensionality and correlated inputs and to identify the most influential variables. Provided insight is used to focus research, reduce dimensionality and decrease decision uncertainty. We conclude that active learning is needed to fully understand complex systems behavior. Surrogate models can be readily explored at no computational expense, and can also be used as emulator to improve rapid policy making in various settings.","['Willem L', 'Stijven S', 'Vladislavleva E', 'Broeckhove J', 'Beutels P', 'Hens N']",2014,10,4,PLoS Comput Biol,"Willem L, et al.

Varicella usually occurs in children under ten years of age. It is generally a mild infection and in the UK vaccination is not offered as part of the routine immunisation programme. However, adults who develop varicella are at risk of developing complications and the infection is likely to be more severe. Serious complications are a particular risk for pregnant women, unborn children, neonates and those who are immunocompromised. Nurses whose work brings them into contact with those at risk have a vital role in providing information about the importance of avoiding varicella. After the acute infection, the varicella zoster virus gains access to the ganglia in the sensory nervous system where it can remain dormant for years.

24728480,"Lower transplacental antibody transport for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella zoster in very preterm infants.","BACKGROUND: Maternal antibodies, transported over the placenta during pregnancy, contribute to the protection of infants from infectious diseases during the first months of life. In term infants, this protection does not last until the first recommended measles-mumps-rubella vaccination at 14 months in the Netherlands, while these viruses still circulate. The aim of the study was to investigate the antibody concentration against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) in mothers and preterm infants or healthy term infants at birth.
METHODS: Antibody concentrations specific for MMRV were measured in cord blood samples from preterm (gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1500 g) and term infants, and matched maternal serum samples, using a fluorescent bead-based multiplex immune-assay.
RESULTS: Due to lower placental transfer ratios of antibodies against MMRV in 96 preterm infants (range 0.75-0.87) compared to 42 term infants (range 1.39-1.65), the preterm infants showed 1.7-2.5 times lower geometric mean concentrations at birth compared to term infants. Maternal antibody concentration is the most important determinant of infant antibody concentration against MMRV.
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants benefit to a lesser extent from maternal antibodies against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella than term infants, posing them even earlier at risk for infectious diseases caused by these still circulating viruses.","['van den Berg JP', 'Westerbeek EA', 'Smits GP', 'van der Klis FR', 'Berbers GA', 'van Elburg RM']",2014,9,4,PLoS One,"van den Berg JP, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 255 medical, nursing and obstetrics students who had not entered as a student or worked in a hospital from 3 different schools were enrolled in the study in 2012 (Qazvin province, Iran). Demographics and other information as well as the history of Varicella were obtained through a self-administered questionnaire. Blood samples were collected to determine the Varicella IgG levels via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A statistical analysis was performed by calculating prevalences and their 95% confidence intervals. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, Cohen's kappa and positive and negative likelihood ratios of recalled history were determined. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 21.3 ± 4.3 years. Seropositivity rate was 74.5%. The relationships between marital status, number of family members, and acquired VZV history with immunity against the virus were statistically significant. The overall rate of reported history was 57%. The positive and negative predictive values of self-reported history of Varicella were 91% and 47.3%, respectively.

RESULTS: The premium alert threshold for mumps, other diarrhea and rubella was P90, dysentery was P75, scarlet fever and chickenpox was P80, and the premium threshold for hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and influenza was P95, the sensitivity of 8 major communicable diseases were 100%, 100%, 86%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 94%, 100%, respectively; the specificities were 92%, 73%, 72%, 77%, 73%, 92%, 66%, 80%, respectively; the positive predictive values were 43%, 40%, 32%, 8%, 24%, 20%, 59%, 47%, respectively; and the negative predictive values were 100%, 100%, 97%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 96%, 100%, respectively. The national recommended alert thresholds for the 8 major communicable diseases were P80, except for chickenpox (P50) and HFMD (CUSUM).
CONCLUSION: 6 out of 8 major communicable diseases' early detection thresholds in Songjiang district should be adjusted according to the analysis results. Premium alert threshold selection need to consider the local disease report and the characteristics of infectious diseases to upgrade the early detection capability.","['Wang R', 'Long Y', 'Liu H', 'Yao X', 'Zeng G']",2014,48,1,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Wang R, et al.

24705143,The relative importance of frequency of contacts and duration of exposure for the spread of directly transmitted infections.,"The recent availability of survey data on social contact patterns has made possible important advances in the understanding of the social determinants of the spread of close-contact infections, and of the importance of long-lasting contacts for effective transmission to occur. Still, little is known about the relationship between two of the most critical identified factors (frequency of contacts and duration of exposure) and how this relationship applies to different types of infections. By integrating data from two independently collected social surveys (Polymod and time use), we propose a model that combines these two transmission determinants into a new epidemiologically relevant measure of contacts: the number of ""suitable"" contacts, which is the number of contacts that involve a sufficiently long exposure time to allow for transmission. The validity of this new epidemiological measure is tested against Italian serological data for varicella and parvovirus-B19, with uncertainty evaluated using the Bayesian melding technique. The model performs quite well, indicating that the interplay between time of exposure and contacts is critical for varicella transmission, while for B19 it is the duration of exposure that matters for transmission.","['De Cao E', 'Zagheni E', 'Manfredi P', 'Melegaro A']",2014,15,3,Biostatistics,"De Cao E, et al.

24691986,Continuous sequential boundaries for vaccine safety surveillance.,"Various recently developed sequential methods have been used to detect signals for post-marketing surveillance in drug and vaccine safety. Among these, the maximized sequential probability ratio test (MaxSPRT) has been used to detect elevated risks of adverse events following vaccination using large healthcare databases. However, a limitation of MaxSPRT is that it only provides a time-invariant flat boundary. In this study, we propose the use of time-varying boundaries for controlling how type I error is distributed throughout the surveillance period. This is especially useful in two scenarios: (i) when we desire generally larger sample sizes before a signal is generated, for example, when early adopters are not representative of the larger population; and (ii) when it is desired for a signal to be generated as early as possible, for example, when the adverse event is considered rare but serious. We consider four specific time-varying boundaries (which we call critical value functions), and we study their statistical power and average time to signal detection. The methodology we present here can be viewed as a generalization or flexible extension of MaxSPRT.","['Li R', 'Stewart B', 'Weintraub E', 'McNeil MM']",2014,33,19,Stat Med,"Li R, et al.

24687808,Clinical and molecular aspects of the live attenuated Oka varicella vaccine.,"VZV is a ubiquitous member of the Herpesviridae family that causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Both manifestations can cause great morbidity and mortality and are therefore of significant economic burden. The introduction of varicella vaccination as part of childhood immunization programs has resulted in a remarkable decline in varicella incidence, and associated hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in the USA. The vaccine preparation, vOka, is a live attenuated virus produced by serial passage of a wild-type clinical isolate termed pOka in human and guinea pig cell lines. Although vOka is clinically attenuated, it can cause mild varicella, establish latency, and reactivate to cause herpes zoster. Sequence analysis has shown that vOka differs from pOka by at least 42 loci; however, not all genomes possess the novel vOka change at all positions, creating a heterogeneous population of genetically distinct haplotypes. This, together with the extreme cell-associated nature of VZV replication in cell culture and the lack of an animal model, in which the complete VZV life cycle can be replicated, has limited studies into the molecular basis for vOka attenuation. Comparative studies of vOka with pOka replication in T cells, dorsal root ganglia, and skin indicate that attenuation likely involves multiple mutations within ORF 62 and several other genes. This article presents an overview of the clinical aspects of the vaccine and current progress on understanding the molecular mechanisms that account for the clinical phenotype of reduced virulence.","['Quinlivan M', 'Breuer J']",2014,24,4,Rev Med Virol,Quinlivan M and Breuer J.

24682723,Use of vaccination in a large outbreak of primary varicella in a detention setting for African immigrants.,"BACKGROUND: Primary varicella (PV) presents a public health risk for adults in closed residential settings, especially for immigrants from tropical areas where infection during childhood is less likely.
METHODS: In this study, an outbreak of PV at a detention facility for illegal immigrants from Eritrea and Sudan in southern Israel is described. Basic demographic information and clinical course for all cases were obtained.
RESULTS: One hundred and nine cases of PV, all in young adult men aged 18-40 years, were diagnosed over a 7-month period (June to December 2012). Diagnosed patients were placed in quarantine until the resolution of illness without other public health measures being implemented. The Israeli Ministry of Health was notified of the outbreak in early December and recommended two doses of varicella vaccine for all susceptible detainees and staff. Within 2 weeks of completion of the first dose of vaccine, there was only one additional case in a detainee immunized 13 days prior to diagnosis. The effectiveness of vaccination in halting the outbreak was immediate, despite the fact that 15.6% of detainees refused to be immunized.
CONCLUSIONS: The possible roles of vaccination or natural infection in achieving herd immunity and thereby ending the outbreak in this population are discussed. We recommend considering early vaccination for all when an outbreak or a series of connected cases is detected in a closed-residential setting such as the detention facility described here.","['Haas EJ', 'Dukhan L', 'Goldstein L', 'Lyandres M', 'Gdalevich M']",2014,6,3,Int Health,"Haas EJ, et al.

24674912,Genetic mechanisms in the intergenerational transmission of health.,"This paper uses a sample of adoptees to study the genetic mechanisms underlying intergenerational associations in chronic health conditions. I begin by estimating baseline intergenerational models with a sample of approximately 125,000 parent-child pairs, and find that children with a parent who has a specific chronic health condition are at least 100% more likely to have the same condition themselves. To assess the role of genetic mechanisms in generating these strong correlations, I estimate models using a sample of approximately 2400 adoptees, and find that genetic transmission accounts for only 20-30% of the baseline associations. As falsification tests, I repeat this exercise using health measures with externally established levels of genetic determination (height and chicken pox), and the results suggest that comparisons of biological and adopted children are a valid method of isolating genetic effects in this sample. Finally, to corroborate these adoptee-based estimates, I examine health correlations among monozygotic twins, which provide an upper bound estimate of genetic influences, and find a similarly modest role for genetic transmission. I conclude that intergenerational health transmission is an important hindrance to overall socioeconomic mobility, but that the majority of transmission occurs through environmental factors or gene-environment interactions, leaving scope for interventions to effectively mitigate health persistence.",['Thompson O'],2014,35,,J Health Econ,Thompson O.

24671555,Varicella and varicella vaccination in South Korea.,"With continuing occurrence of varicella despite increasing vaccine coverage for the past 20 years, a case-based study, a case-control study, and an immunogenicity and safety study were conducted to address the impact of varicella vaccination in South Korea. Varicella patients under the age of 16 years were enrolled for the case-based study. For the case-control study, varicella patients between 12 months and 15 years of age were enrolled with one control matched for each patient. For the immunogenicity and safety study, otherwise healthy children from 12 to 24 months old were immunized with Suduvax (Green Cross, South Korea). Fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody was measured before and 6 weeks after immunization. In the case-based study, the median age of the patients was 4 years. Among 152 patients between 1 and 15 years of age, 139 children received varicella vaccine and all had breakthrough infections. Clinical courses were not ameliorated in vaccinated patients, but more vaccinated patients received outpatient rather than inpatient care. In the case-control study, the adjusted overall effectiveness of varicella vaccination was 54%. In the immunogenicity and safety study, the seroconversion rate and geometric mean titer for FAMA antibody were 76.67% and 5.31. Even with increasing varicella vaccine uptake, we illustrate no upward age shift in the peak incidence, a high proportion of breakthrough disease, almost no amelioration in disease presentation by vaccination, and insufficient immunogenicity of domestic varicella vaccine. There is need to improve the varicella vaccine used in South Korea.","['Oh SH', 'Choi EH', 'Shin SH', 'Kim YK', 'Chang JK', 'Choi KM', 'Hur JK', 'Kim KH', 'Kim JY', 'Chung EH', 'Lee SY', 'Park SE', 'Cha S', 'Kim KN', 'Ma SH', 'Eun BW', 'Kim NH', 'Jo DS', 'Choi BY', 'Kim SA']",2014,21,5,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Oh SH, et al.

24666533,[The Alice in Wonderland syndrome].,"BACKGROUND: Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is characterised by abnormal perception, such as metamorphopsia, macropsia, micropsia, teleopsia and pelopsia. Although brief and transient, these episodes of visual distortion may lead to great anxiety, especially in children. AIWS seems to be associated with specific viral infections, epilepsy, migraine, and brain tumours.
CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old boy had episodes of seeing persons further away than they actually were (teleopsia). These perceptual distortions occurred when he was about to go to sleep. The episodes never exceeded 10 minutes. He was referred to a paediatrician and an ophthalmologist, who found no abnormalities. Serological tests showed a positive IgG for both Epstein-Barr and varicella zoster virus.
CONCLUSION: The cause of AIWS is unclear. When occurring in the young patient, parents often become worried. In most cases no serious pathological cause is found. Usually, reassurance is sufficient. Therefore, general practitioners should be able to recognise the symptoms.",['Mantingh MR'],2014,158,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Mantingh MR. [The Alice in Wonderland syndrome].

24626555,Infection and childhood leukemia: review of evidence.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze studies that evaluated the role of infections as well as indirect measures of exposure to infection in the risk of childhood leukemia, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
METHODS: A search in Medline, Lilacs, and SciELO scientific publication databases initially using the descriptors ""childhood leukemia"" and ""infection"" and later searching for the words ""childhood leukemia"" and ""maternal infection or disease"" or ""breastfeeding"" or ""daycare attendance"" or ""vaccination"" resulted in 62 publications that met the following inclusion criteria: subject aged ≤ 15 years; specific analysis of cases diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or total leukemia; exposure assessment of mothers' or infants' to infections (or proxy of infection), and risk of leukemia.
RESULTS: Overall, 23 studies that assessed infections in children support the hypothesis that occurrence of infection during early childhood reduces the risk of leukemia, but there are disagreements within and between studies. The evaluation of exposure to infection by indirect measures showed evidence of reduced risk of leukemia associated mainly with daycare attendance. More than 50.0% of the 16 studies that assessed maternal exposure to infection observed increased risk of leukemia associated with episodes of influenza, pneumonia, chickenpox, herpes zoster, lower genital tract infection, skin disease, sexually transmitted diseases, Epstein-Barr virus, and Helicobacter pylori .
CONCLUSIONS: Although no specific infectious agent has been identified, scientific evidence suggests that exposure to infections has some effect on childhood leukemia etiology.","['Maia Rda R', 'Wünsch Filho V']",2013,47,6,Rev Saude Publica,Maia Rda R and Wünsch Filho V.

24620971,Sunlight exposure and multiple sclerosis in a tropical country.,"OBJECTIVE: We analysed past and current sun exposure in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients as compared with matched controls in Mexico, a country with tropical climate.
METHODS: In a case-controlled study that include 83 MS patients and 166 matched controls, we inquired about sunlight exposure in two different periods: during adolescence and during the immediate past 5 years. Indicators were: exposure on quotidian and weekend outdoor activities with direct sunlight contact as expressed on frequency by mean number of days, daytime (morning, noon, afternoon), number of hours, visits to sunny places, and use of sunblocking agents. Additional elements were socioeconomic status, skin colour, and antecedent of varicella infection during childhood.
RESULTS: MS patients showed a larger proportion of white skin. MS patients had more sunlight exposure during adolescence (80% versus 60%, P = 0·002); this tendency prevailed on current indicators (46% versus 30%, P = 0·02). However, current exposure on weekends (10% versus 22%, P = 0·02) and visits to the beach (64% versus 98%, P = 0·002) were lower in MS than in controls.
DISCUSSION: Mexico gets more sunlight through the year than areas with high incidence of MS; nevertheless, its prevalence has greatly increased over the last decades, making it a relevant emerging disease. Our results indicate that in a tropical country, there is no association between sunlight exposure and the risk to develop MS, given the immunological effects of sunlight exposure either through UV radiation or vitamin D metabolism.","['Espinosa-Ramírez G', 'Ordoñez G', 'Flores-Rivera J', 'Sotelo J']",2014,36,7,Neurol Res,"Espinosa-Ramírez G, et al.

24607430,Molecular detection of varicella zoster virus while keeping an eye on the budget.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR is highly sensitive compared to traditional detection methods like culture and direct fluorescent antibody testing (DFA); however, the high cost of commercial assays prohibits their use in many clinical laboratories. Major contributors to cost are the nucleic acid extraction and the PCR reagents. This study evaluated an ""in-house"" qualitative real-time PCR where the nucleic acid extraction was replaced by a crude extraction, homogenization and heat treatment. Three methods were compared: virus culture and DFA and real-time PCR following each extraction methods. The real-time PCR was highly specific for VZV, and the analytical sensitivity was equivalent following both extraction methods. In contrast, virus culture and DFA was approximately 10,000-fold less sensitive. Using 200 clinical specimens, the sensitivity for the real-time PCR following nucleic acid extraction or homogenization and heat treatment was essentially equivalent at 100% and 97.2%, respectively; whereas, virus culture and DFA was significantly less sensitive at 54.8%. Overall, homogenization and heat treatment combined with a qualitative in-house real-time PCR is a rapid, accurate and cost effective method for the detection of VZV.","['Binkhamis K', 'Al-Siyabi T', 'Heinstein C', 'Hatchette TF', 'LeBlanc JJ']",2014,202,,J Virol Methods,"Binkhamis K, et al.

One strategy recommended for increasing varicella vaccination coverage is a school entry requirement of proof of varicella immunity. To determine the extent of implementation of the routine 2-dose varicella vaccination program, the number of states with a 2-dose varicella vaccination elementary school entry requirement in 2012 was compared with the number in 2007, and 2-dose varicella vaccination coverage during 2006 was compared with coverage in 2012 among children aged 7 years, using data from six Immunization Information System (IIS) sentinel sites. The number of states (including the District of Columbia) with a 2-dose varicella vaccination elementary school entry requirement increased from four in 2007 to 36 in 2012. Two-dose varicella vaccination coverage levels among children aged 7 years in the six IIS sentinel sites increased from a range of 3.6%-8.9% in 2006 to a range of 79.9%-92.0% in 2012 and were approaching the levels of 2-dose measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) coverage, which had a range of 81.9%-94.0% in 2012. These increases suggest substantial progress in implementing the routine 2-dose varicella vaccination program in the first 6 years since its recommendation by ACIP.

RESULTS: A total of 32 patients (25 males, mean age 43.5 ±14.5 years) were enrolled into this study; 3 patients (2 patients aged <12 years, 1 patient with advanced cardiac failure) were excluded. Of these 32 patients, 18 (58%) were current smokers, 16 patients (50%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and of these, 14 (87.5%) required mechanical ventilation. The mean duration of intensive care unit stay was 5.59 ±5.37 days. All patients were treated with intravenous acyclovir, corticosteroids and antibiotics were added when indicated. 31 patients improved and were discharged home. There was one death (a 32 year-old female with underlying systemic lupus erythematosus).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with varicella pneumonia are at high risk of respiratory failure. Early implementation of supportive therapy seems to positively influence the recovery rate and outcome. Our study supports treatment using a combination of acyclovir and corticosteroids.","['Anwar SK', 'Masoodi I', 'Alfaifi A', 'Hussain S', 'Sirwal IA']",2014,19,2,Antivir Ther,"Anwar SK, et al.

24518632,Risk factors for complicated varicella infection in pediatric oncology patients at a tertiary health care facility in Pakistan.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella zoster infection (VZI) is well recognized as a potential cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised pediatric oncology patients (POP). The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical profile and risk factors for complications and outcomes of VZI in POP treated with acyclovir.
METHODOLOGY: Medical records of all POP with a discharge diagnosis of VZI over a period of seven years (2005-2011) were reviewed. The demographic features, underlying malignancy, risk factors for VZI, complications, and outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: Thirty-six POP with VZI were identified. Leukemia was the most common underlying malignancy (n = 20, 58.8%), followed by lymphoma (n = 7, 20.6%) and solid organ tumors (n = 7, 20.6%). Most of the cases (41%) were observed in children under five. All patients were treated with acyclovir. Varicella-related complications developed in 10 (29%) patients. The most frequent complication was bloodstream infection (n = 3, 8.8%), followed by pneumonia (n = 2, 5.9%), skin infection (n = 2, 5.9%), hepatitis, renal failure, and encephalitis. Independent risk factors associated with complications were age < five years, weight for age < fifth percentile, delay in seeking care (> seven days after onset of symptoms) and severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/cm). One child died secondary to varicella encephalitis.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that young age, poor health-seeking behavior, severe neutropenia, and being underweight are the major risk factors for the development of varicella-related complications in POP in developing countries. These complications could be favorably modified through active immunization of immunocompetent children.","['Alam MM', 'Qamar FN', 'Khan ZW', 'Kumar V', 'Mushtaq N', 'Fadoo Z']",2014,8,2,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Alam MM, et al.

24509782,Molecular mechanisms of varicella zoster virus pathogenesis.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles). Investigating VZV pathogenesis is challenging as VZV is a human-specific virus and infection does not occur, or is highly restricted, in other species. However, the use of human tissue xenografts in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) enables the analysis of VZV infection in differentiated human cells in their typical tissue microenvironment. Xenografts of human skin, dorsal root ganglia or foetal thymus that contains T cells can be infected with mutant viruses or in the presence of inhibitors of viral or cellular functions to assess the molecular mechanisms of VZV-host interactions. In this Review, we discuss how these models have improved our understanding of VZV pathogenesis.","['Zerboni L', 'Sen N', 'Oliver SL', 'Arvin AM']",2014,12,3,Nat Rev Microbiol,"Zerboni L, et al.

24508041,Association of the use of MMRV in infants by pediatric infectious disease specialists with that of other affiliated providers.,"BACKGROUND: In an effort to maximize vaccine acceptance by minimizing adverse events following immunization associated with fever, including seizures, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended in 2009 the use of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and varicella vaccines (V) given separately (MMR+V) rather than combination MMRV as the first dose of MMR-containing vaccine to infants. We evaluated factors associated with continued administration of MMRV as the first dose in many infants despite the ACIP recommendation.
METHODS: Children 12 to 23 months of age who received MMRV or MMR+V between May 1, 2010 and April 30, 2011 were identified. Patient, provider and facility characteristics associated with MMRV or MMR+V administration were analyzed by bivariate and by multilevel multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Altogether, 30,017 children received the first dose of MMRV or MMR+V at 12 to 23 months of age between May 1, 2010 and April 30, 2011. Of these, 10.2% received MMRV while 89.8% received MMR+V. MMRV was more likely to be administered to children who were non-compliant with vaccine recommendations at age one (adjusted odds ratio=1.48, 95%CI=1.28, 1.71). In addition, administration of MMRV by a Pediatric Infectious Disease specialist affiliated with a clinic was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of administration of MMRV by other providers at that clinic (interval odds ratio 80=2.18, 675.94, P(OR>1)=95%).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that while most providers followed the ACIP recommendation to administer MMR and V separately, Pediatric Infectious Disease specialists' vaccination practices may impact compliance with ACIP recommendations by other providers. Further study of the drivers behind the use of MMRV rather than MMR+V as the first dose of measles-containing vaccine is needed to determine if reinforcement or if clarification of ACIP recommendations is needed to elucidate when MMRV might be preferred over MMR+V.","['Ackerson BK', 'Li BH', 'Sy LS', 'Cheetham TC', 'Jacobsen SJ']",2014,32,16,Vaccine,"Ackerson BK, et al.

24497829,RNA-seq analysis of host and viral gene expression highlights interaction between varicella zoster virus and keratinocyte differentiation.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of chickenpox and shingles, diseases characterized by epidermal skin blistering. Using a calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation model we investigated the interaction between epidermal differentiation and VZV infection. RNA-seq analysis showed that VZV infection has a profound effect on differentiating keratinocytes, altering the normal process of epidermal gene expression to generate a signature that resembles patterns of gene expression seen in both heritable and acquired skin-blistering disorders. Further investigation by real-time PCR, protein analysis and electron microscopy revealed that VZV specifically reduced expression of specific suprabasal cytokeratins and desmosomal proteins, leading to disruption of epidermal structure and function. These changes were accompanied by an upregulation of kallikreins and serine proteases. Taken together VZV infection promotes blistering and desquamation of the epidermis, both of which are necessary to the viral spread and pathogenesis. At the same time, analysis of the viral transcriptome provided evidence that VZV gene expression was significantly increased following calcium treatment of keratinocytes. Using reporter viruses and immunohistochemistry we confirmed that VZV gene and protein expression in skin is linked with cellular differentiation. These studies highlight the intimate host-pathogen interaction following VZV infection of skin and provide insight into the mechanisms by which VZV remodels the epidermal environment to promote its own replication and spread.","['Jones M', 'Dry IR', 'Frampton D', 'Singh M', 'Kanda RK', 'Yee MB', 'Kellam P', 'Hollinshead M', 'Kinchington PR', ""O'Toole EA"", 'Breuer J']",2014,10,1,PLoS Pathog,"Jones M, et al.

24494784,Varicella vaccination: a laboured take-off.,"Varicella vaccines are highly immunogenic, efficacious and safe in preventing varicella disease. The USA has been the first country recommending universal vaccination. In the European Union/European Economic Area countries, the use of varicella vaccine is heterogeneous, with some countries recommending universal vaccination in children at national or regional level, others only in high-risk groups and others having no recommendation at all. Uncertainties on the potential impact of varicella vaccination on the epidemiology of varicella and herpes zoster still exist. These uncertainties are the main reason behind the diverse vaccine recommendations. Surveillance systems and mathematical models could be useful to address these uncertainties. However, the lack of surveillance of varicella and herpes zoster in some countries, as well as the high variability of surveillance systems in the countries that have one, makes it difficult to assess the effect of the vaccine. On the other hand, mathematical models are based on assumptions and should be interpreted carefully. Continuous surveillance of varicella and herpes zoster is needed to identify any changes in the epidemiological presentation of the diseases. In any case, continuous surveillance will be needed to fully describe the impact of the programmes currently running and clarify some of the actual uncertainties in the near future. Additionally, increasing our understanding of the risk factors for development of herpes zoster is required.","['Carrillo-Santisteve P', 'Lopalco PL']",2014,20 Suppl 5,,Clin Microbiol Infect,Carrillo-Santisteve P and Lopalco PL.

Due to a slightly increased risk of febrile convulsions after first-dose application of combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine separate first-dose vaccinations with MMR and monovalent V vaccine were recommended in September 2011.
METHODS: We compared V and MMR vaccinations in paediatric practices from two surveillance regions (Munich and Würzburg) one year before and after the change in the recommendation.
RESULTS: A total of 1405/326 monthly reports were provided by a monthly average of 79/14 practices participating in Munich/Würzburg. V first-dose vaccinations (monovalent V or MMRV vaccine) declined by 12% in Munich (from 10.1 to 8.9 vaccinations per month and practice; p<0.005) and by 4% in Würzburg (from 9.9 to 9.5; p=0.620), respectively. First-dose vaccinations for MMR (MMR or MMRV vaccine) did not change significantly in both regions.

24397902,Timeliness of routine immunization in a population-based Italian cohort of very preterm infants: results of the ACTION follow-up project.,"BACKGROUND: Although very preterm infants are recommended to receive immunizations, according to their chronological age, immunization start in these infants is often delayed. Aim To measure coverage and timeliness of routine immunizations in Italian very preterm infants and to assess determinants of delay.
METHODS: We followed up infants 22-31 completed weeks of gestational age discharged from intensive care. We measured the proportion of children with one dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-poliohepatitis, B-Hib vaccine (DTP-Pol-HBV-Hib), measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR), conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (Pnc), conjugate meningococcal C vaccine (MenC), and varicella vaccine (Var) by 24 months. We used the Kaplan Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the age, at immunization start and determinants of timeliness for each vaccine.
RESULTS: Data on 1102 (92.1%) children out of 1196 included in the cohort were analyzed. Immunization start by 24 months of age occurred in 95.9% of children for DTP-Pol-HBV-Hib; 84.0% for MMR; 49.7% for Pnc; 38.5% for MenC; and 4.1% for Var. Eighty-seven percent of participants received the first dose of DTP-Pol-HBV-Hib by 6 months of age, and 66.7% had their first MMR administered by 18 months. Hospitalization was associated with delay for all vaccines with the exception of MenC and Var. Maternal employment was associated with earlier immunization for MMR, Pnc, and MenC. DTP-Pol-HBV-Hib timeliness improved with increasing birthweight and paternal employment and decreased with a larger number of siblings in the household. MMR was delayed in children with cerebral palsy, and in those with a larger number of children in the household. Immunization for Pnc was delayed in children with larger number of siblings.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunization start for all vaccines was considerably delayed in many very preterm infants. Public health strategies taking into account determinants of delay should be implemented to improve coverage and timeliness of vaccination in this group of infants.","['Tozzi AE', 'Piga S', 'Corchia C', 'Di Lallo D', 'Carnielli V', 'Chiandotto V', 'Fertz MC', 'Miniaci S', 'Rusconi F', 'Cuttini M']",2014,32,7,Vaccine,"Tozzi AE, et al.

METHODS: PCR-RFLP analysis of VZV ORF 38, 54 and 62 was used for genotyping in VZV from blood or vesicular fluid from 31 patients with chickenpox or herpes zoster. The PstI restriction site of ORF 38, BglI restriction site of ORF 54 and SmaI restriction site of ORF 62 were analyzed using RFLP to determine the genotype.
RESULTS: Except for one strain, all other VZV isolates had the genotype characteristic of the wild type VZV strain PstI+BglI+ SmaI-, which was characteristic of the Asian strain. None of the isolates had the American or the European VZV profile (PstI+BglI-) but were similar to isolates from Africa and Asia (PstI+BglI+). Interestingly, one of the VZV strains isolated from a patient with chickenpox had the characteristic genotype of the vaccine strain PstI- BglI+ SmaI+.
CONCLUSIONS: The genotype of the VZV in Sri Lanka is similar to the Asian VZV genotype and can be easily distinguished from the VZV vaccine strain by using the polymorphisms in ORF 38, ORF 54 and ORF 62.","['Lohitharajah J', 'Malavige GN', 'Wijewickrama A', 'Ambagawita A', 'Seneviratne AL', 'Ogg G']",2013,58,4,Ceylon Med J,"Lohitharajah J, et al.

24381359,"Comparing active and passive varicella surveillance in Philadelphia, 2005-2010: recommendations for the transition to nationwide passive varicella disease surveillance.","OBJECTIVE: The Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) conducts active surveillance for varicella in West Philadelphia. For its approximately 300 active surveillance sites, PDPH mandates biweekly reports of varicella (including zero cases) and performs intensive case investigations. Elsewhere in Philadelphia, surveillance sites passively report varicella cases, and abbreviated investigations are conducted. We used active varicella surveillance program data to inform the transition to nationwide passive varicella surveillance.
METHODS: We compared classification of reported cases, varicella disease incidence, and reporting completeness for active and passive surveillance areas for 2005-2010. We assessed reporting completeness using capture-recapture analysis of 2- to 18-year-old cases reported by schools/daycare centers and health-care providers.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2010, PDPH received 3,280 passive and 969 active surveillance varicella case reports. Most passive surveillance reports were classified as probable cases (18% confirmed, 56% probable, and 26% excluded), whereas nearly all of the active surveillance reports were either confirmed or excluded (36% confirmed, 11% probable, and 53% excluded). Overall incidence rates calculated using confirmed/probable cases were similar in the active and passive surveillance areas. Detection of laboratory-confirmed, breakthrough, and moderate-to-severe cases was equivalent for both surveillance areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Although active surveillance for varicella results in better classified cases, passive surveillance provides comparable data for monitoring disease trends in breakthrough and moderate-to-severe varicella. To further improve passive surveillance in the two-dose-varicella vaccine era, jurisdictions should consider conducting periodic enhanced surveillance, encouraging laboratory testing, and collecting additional varicella-specific variables for passive surveillance.","['Viner K', 'Perella D', 'Lopez A', 'Bialek S', 'Nguyen M', 'Spells N', 'Watson B']",2014,129,1,Public Health Rep,"Viner K, et al.

Here, we aim to determine the seroprevalence of these infections among physicians and nurses and to compare the history of varicella with the results of varicella antibodies among study participants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two randomly selected groups, one group of physicians and one of nurses, from a university hospital in Jordan were interviewed and their serum IgG antibodies were measured.
RESULTS: The physicians and nurses group had 252 and 241 participants, respectively. The physicians group had significantly more males and younger participants. The percentage of individuals in the physician and nurse groups with positive antibodies to measles was 75.4% and 75.1%, respectively; mumps, 88.5% and 94.2%; rubella, 89.3% and 87.1%; and varicella, 92.1% and 92.5%. Immunity was similar between the 2 groups except for mumps, where significantly more nurses were immune.

24374498,Risk of febrile convulsions after MMRV vaccination in comparison to MMR or MMR+V vaccination.,"BACKGROUND: In July 2006, Priorix-Tetra™, a combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, was licensed in Germany. Since a postlicensure study had shown a more than twofold elevated risk of febrile convulsions (FC) after first dose vaccination with the combined MMRV vaccine ProQuad(®) compared to separately administered MMR and V vaccines (MMR+V), the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, the German regulatory agency for vaccine licensing and safety, requested a study investigating the risk of FC for Priorix-Tetra™.
METHODS: We performed a matched cohort study based on claims data of more than 17 million insurees in the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database. All children born between 01.01.2004 and 31.12.2008 who received a 1st dose of MMRV vaccine were matched to children vaccinated with MMR, MMR+V and MMR or MMR+V (combined group), respectively, by sex, age, month of vaccination and statutory health insurance. The primary outcome was defined as hospitalization with a diagnosis of FC without any alternative plausible cause of FC, e.g. an infection or neurological condition, coded as main discharge diagnosis. The secondary outcome excluded only neurological conditions to provide a more comparable outcome definition to the one used in the ProQuad(®) study. Numbers needed to harm (NNH), risk ratios and confounder adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated to compare the exposure groups.
RESULTS: In the main risk period 5-12 days after immunization, the adjusted ORs of the primary endpoint for immunization with MMRV vaccine relative to the comparator vaccine indicated in brackets were 4.1 [95% CI 1.3-12.7; MMR], 3.5 [0.7-19.0; MMR+V], and 4.1 [1.5-11.1; MMR and MMR+V]. The corresponding ORs for the secondary outcome were 2.3 [1.4-3.9; MMR], 1.5 [0.8-2.9; MMR+V] and 2.4 [1.5-3.9; MMR and MMR+V].
CONCLUSIONS: This study in children younger than 5 years, 90% of them between 11 and 23 months, shows a risk of FC similar in magnitude for Priorix-Tetra™ as has previously been reported for ProQuad(®) suggesting a class effect for these quadrivalent vaccines.","['Schink T', 'Holstiege J', 'Kowalzik F', 'Zepp F', 'Garbe E']",2014,32,6,Vaccine,"Schink T, et al.

We aimed to increase the knowledge of the severity, morbidity and mortality caused by varicella, by a review of cases requiring paediatric intensive care in New Zealand where vaccine is available but not funded.
METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a 10-year period (July 2001-July 2011) identified from the PICU database with a primary or secondary code for varicella.
RESULTS: Thirty-four cases were identified and 26 cases were included. Of the 26 cases, 84.6% were Maori or Pacific Island ethnicity, 54% had no preceding medical condition and 23% were immunocompromised. Main PICU admission reasons were neurologic (38.5%), secondary bacterial sepsis or shock (26.9%), respiratory (15.4%), disseminated varicella (11.5%), or other causes (7.7%). Fifty per cent of children required inotropic support and 81% invasive ventilation. Four children died (15%), three of whom were immunocompromised. A further eight children (31%) had ongoing disability at hospital discharge.

24352459,Analysis of T cell responses during active varicella-zoster virus reactivation in human ganglia.,"UNLABELLED: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is responsible for both varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). During varicella, the virus establishes latency within the sensory ganglia and can reactivate to cause herpes zoster, but the immune responses that occur in ganglia during herpes zoster have not previously been defined. We examined ganglia obtained from individuals who, at the time of death, had active herpes zoster. Ganglia innervating the site of the cutaneous herpes zoster rash showed evidence of necrosis, secondary to vasculitis, or localized hemorrhage. Despite this, there was limited evidence of VZV antigen expression, although a large inflammatory infiltrate was observed. Characterization of the infiltrating T cells showed a large number of infiltrating CD4(+) T cells and cytolytic CD8(+) T cells. Many of the infiltrating T cells were closely associated with neurons within the reactivated ganglia, yet there was little evidence of T cell-induced neuronal apoptosis. Notably, an upregulation in the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and MHC-II molecules was observed on satellite glial cells, implying these cells play an active role in directing the immune response during herpes zoster. This is the first detailed characterization of the interaction between T cells and neuronal cells within ganglia obtained from patients suffering herpes zoster at the time of death and provides evidence that CD4(+) and cytolytic CD8(+) T cell responses play an important role in controlling VZV replication in ganglia during active herpes zoster.
IMPORTANCE: VZV is responsible for both varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). During varicella, the virus establishes a life-long dormant infection within the sensory ganglia and can reawaken to cause herpes zoster, but the immune responses that occur in ganglia during herpes zoster have not previously been defined. We examined ganglia obtained from individuals who, at the time of death, had active herpes zoster. We found that specific T cell subsets are likely to play an important role in controlling VZV replication in ganglia during active herpes zoster.","['Steain M', 'Sutherland JP', 'Rodriguez M', 'Cunningham AL', 'Slobedman B', 'Abendroth A']",2014,88,5,J Virol,"Steain M, et al.

24331968,[Field epidemiological study on a varicella outbreak among schoolchildren in Shenzhen].,"OBJECTIVE: Both epidemiologic characteristics and transmission mode of a varicella outbreak among schoolchildren in Shenzhen city were studied and related control measures were discussed.
METHODS: Case definition was established. Case-finding and face-to-face investigation were conducted, followed by analysis on distributions of time, place and persons of the outbreak. Association between possible modes of transmission and the outbreak was explored. Retrospective cohort study was carried out.
RESULTS: The overall attack rate of this outbreak was 4.4% (122 of 2742). The attack rate among primary schoolchildren(8.3%, 118/1419)was higher than that in the middle-school children(0.3%, 4/1323). There were no statistically significant differences on the attack rates between male and female students. A total of 22 classes from the 9 grades were affected by this outbreak and the aggregation of varicella cases was found in classes. The highest attack rates was found in the students of fifth grade(23.7%), followed by from the third grade (13.4%). The main transmission mode appeared to be close personal contact. The outbreak, with four peaks of incidence, lasted 72 days. Data from the investigation suggested that the primary case was introduced into the school during military training involved by the students. Activities related to physical examination for all the schoolchildren seemed to have contributed to the spread of this disease among classes. Delayed isolation of cases appeared to be the major factor causing the spread of disease among classes. Intensive off-school activities or free community bus for children did not seem to be associated with the spreading of the disease. 52.5% (64/122) of the cases had received one-dose of varicella vaccine, with the median of onset after the vaccination as 7 years. The results demonstrated that one single-dose vaccine or long vaccination period were factors related to the insufficient immunity that causing the outbreak of disease.
CONCLUSION: Varicella outbreak has been one of the most grievous public health problems in schools, posting challenges on the implementation of isolation measures, in particular. Once the chain of transmission is in place, it is difficult to make the universal measures effective within a short period.","['Zheng QM', 'Zeng HT', 'Wang TQ', 'Liu Y', 'Wang GL', 'Mei SJ', 'Zhang SX']",2013,34,9,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Zheng QM, et al.

METHODS: A stratified random sample of 949 pregnant women enrolled in the Born in Bradford birth cohort was selected to ensure sufficient numbers of White UK born women, Asian UK born women and Asian women born in Asia. Serum samples taken at 24-28 weeks' gestation were tested for CMV IgG, EBV IgG and VZV IgG. Each woman completed a questionnaire which included socio-demographic information.
RESULTS: CMV seroprevalence was 49% among the White British women, 89% among South Asian UK born women and 98% among South Asian women born in South Asia. These differences remained after adjusting for socio-demographic factors. In contrast, VZV seroprevalence was 95% among women born in the UK but significantly lower at 90% among South Asian women born in Asia. EBV seroprevalence was 94% overall and did not vary by ethnic group/country of birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Although about half of White British women are at risk of primary CMV infection in pregnancy and the associated increased risk of congenital infection, most congenital CMV infections are likely to be in children born to South Asian women with non-primary infection during pregnancy. South Asian women born in South Asia are at risk of VZV infection during pregnancy which could produce congenital varicella syndrome or perinatal chickenpox.

24289750,Varicella zoster: an update on current treatment options and future perspectives.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella zoster virus is a highly contagious virus that causes a primary infection known as varicella (chickenpox) that may reactivate years later to cause herpes zoster (HZ or shingles). After shingles heal, patients may develop post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), neuropathic pain syndrome that can cause significant suffering for years and is often refractory to treatment.
AREAS COVERED: The wide range of treatment and management options for varicella, HZ and PHN are reviewed and discussed. PubMed was the database used for the literature search.
EXPERT OPINION: Antiviral therapy effectively treats acute varicella and HZ. However, PHN is still difficult to manage, especially with the numerous treatment measures that do not work consistently in all patients. The best approach is to prevent the complication from occurring in the first place by preventing HZ with the HZ vaccine, which have decreased the burden of illness caused by VZ and the incidence of HZ. Unlike the varicella vaccine, the uptake for the HZ vaccine is very low and thereby more patients over the age of 50 years should be encouraged to receive the vaccine to reduce the risk of developing HZ. Initiating treatment with gabapentin and antiviral concomitantly as soon as the rash develops may reduce the severity of complications but there is a lack of data showing these medications preventing the development of PHN.","['Kim SR', 'Khan F', 'Ramirez-Fort MK', 'Downing C', 'Tyring SK']",2014,15,1,Expert Opin Pharmacother,"Kim SR, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective study of hospitalizations due to varicella and its complications was conducted in a referral center from 2005 to 2011.
RESULTS: A total of 1192 children with varicella were seen in the emergency room, of which 99 (8.5%) required admission. The annual incidence of admissions due to varicella and varicella complications was, 19.4 and 15.3 cases per 100,000 children under 14 years, respectively. Complications were more common in children under 5 years (79.5%), and with no underlying disease (78.2%). Infection of skin and soft tissue was the most common complication (62%). The mean hospital stay was 4.5 days (SD 4).
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella causes high morbidity, and is more frequent in absolute terms in healthy children under 5 years of age.

24275643,Vaccination to prevent varicella: Goldman and King's response to Myers' interpretation of Varicella Active Surveillance Project data.,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that herpes zoster (HZ) incidence rates among children and adults (aged <60 years) with a history of natural varicella are influenced primarily by the frequency of exogenous exposures, while asymptomatic endogenous reactivations help to cap the rate at approximately 550 cases/100,000 person-years when exogenous boosting becomes rare. The Antelope Valley Varicella Active Surveillance Project was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1995 to monitor the effects of varicella vaccination in one of the three representative regions of the United States. The stability in the data collection and number of reporting sites under varicella surveillance from 1995-2002 and HZ surveillance during 2000-2001 and 2006-2007 contributed to the robustness of the discerned trends.
DISCUSSION: Varicella vaccination may be useful for leukemic children; however, the target population in the United States is all children. Since the varicella vaccine inoculates its recipients with live, attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV), clinical varicella cases have dramatically declined. Declining exogenous exposures (boosts) from children shedding natural VZV have caused waning cell-mediated immunity. Thus, the protection provided by varicella vaccination is neither lifelong nor complete. Moreover, dramatic increases in the incidence of adult shingles cases have been observed since HZ was added to the surveillance in 2000. In 2013, this topic is still debated and remains controversial in the United States.
SUMMARY: When the costs of the booster dose for varicella and the increased shingles recurrences are included, the universal varicella vaccination program is neither effective nor cost-effective.","['Goldman GS', 'King PG']",2014,33,8,Hum Exp Toxicol,Goldman GS and King PG.

A case report.,"We describe the case of a 3-year-old girl, admitted to the pediatric ward for three repeated episodes of severe migraine associated with vertigo, with onset 1 week after complete remission from an episode of chicken pox (i.e., varicella-zoster virus infection). All radiological and laboratory examinations were normal, except for a markedly elevated value of D-dimer (i.e. 8998 ng/ml; local reference range: < 243 ng/ml), measured with a commercial latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. After physical and Doppler ultrasound examination, possible presence of thrombosis was ruled out, and the patient was discharged. In the following year, however, her plasma D-dimer values always remained frankly elevated, so that an analytical interference was suspected. A plasma sample was treated with a specific heterophilic antibodies blocking reagent and then assayed along with the untreated sample, with these showing a marked discrepancy of D-dimer values, that is 232 versus 2877 ng/ml. These results, highly indicative for the presence of heterophilic antibodies, are discussed in the light of the serious challenges that this type of analytical interference may pose on quality and reliability of D-dimer testing.","['Lippi G', 'Ippolito L', 'Tondelli MT', 'Favaloro EJ']",2014,25,3,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,"Lippi G, et al.

It is due to the reactivation of the virus which remains dormant in sensory ganglions following chicken pox. It is usually confined to a single dermatome but may involve 2-3 dermatomes. Typically, it is a unilateral lesion which can affect both cranial and peripheral nerves. It is usually a self-limiting disease; however, it may cause significant morbidity especially in the elderly. It is more common in older people and individuals with immunocompromised conditions. Antiviral drugs can shorten the duration and the severity of the illness and need to be started as soon as possible after the appearance of the rash.

24241094,Seroprevalence of antibodies against varicella-zoster virus among prevalent hemodialysis patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can cause life-threatening disease in immunosuppressed patients, including kidney allograft recipients. This study was designed to evaluate the immune status of the cohort of hemodialysis patients, who could potentially be candidates for kidney transplantation, against VZV, and to determine the correlation between the self-reported history of chickenpox infection and the VZV antibody status in this population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serologic testing for VZV was performed for 187 patients at different age groups receiving hemodialysis treatment at Hasheminejad Hospital, Tehran. The enzyme immunoassay method was used for determining immunoglobulin G antibodies against VZV.
RESULTS: A total of 187 patients, aged 18 to 88 years (mean, 57.5 +/- 16.2 years), were examined. Ninety-five patients (50.8%) were men. Overall, 183 patients (97.9%) were found to be seropositive for VZV. No significant correlation was observed between patients' history of chickenpox disease and seropositivity of VZV. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of patients' self-reported history was 39.3%, 50%, 97.2%, and 1.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Serologic screening for VZV in patients who are candidates for transplantation is essential to determine their immune status prior to transplant surgery. We suggest that this population be considered as the target group for future immunization programs in Iran.","['Talebi-Taher M', 'Hassanzadeh T', 'Ossareh S']",2013,7,6,Iran J Kidney Dis,"Talebi-Taher M, et al.

24228821,Cost-effectiveness analysis of varicella vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis in Hong Kong.,"OBJECTIVES: The varicella vaccine is an effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for chickenpox. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of PEP using varicella vaccine for pediatric patients from the perspective of the public healthcare provider in Hong Kong.
METHODS: A decision tree was designed to compare cost and clinical outcomes of PEP with varicella vaccine versus no PEP in pediatric patients (aged 1-18 y) susceptible to chickenpox with household exposure. Two tiers of outcome were simulated: (1) total direct medical cost per subject exposed, and (2) the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss associated with chickenpox per subject exposed. Model inputs were retrieved from local epidemiology and the medical literature. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all parameters to test the robustness of model results.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed PEP with varicella vaccine to be less costly (expected cost USD 320 vs USD 731) with lower QALY loss (0.00423 QALY vs 0.01122 QALY) when compared to no PEP. The sensitivity analysis showed that PEP with varicella vaccine was less costly if PEP effectiveness was > 6.2% or the chickenpox infection rate without PEP was > 8.6%. In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, PEP with vaccine was cost-effective over 99% of the time, with a mean cost saving of USD 611 per patient (95% confidence interval USD 602-620; p < 0.001) and lower mean QALY loss of 0.00809 QALY (95% confidence interval 0.00802-0.00816 QALY; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Using varicella vaccine as PEP appears to be a cost-saving strategy to avert QALY loss in susceptible pediatric patients exposed to chickenpox in Hong Kong.","['Chui KS', 'Wu HL', 'You JH']",2014,46,1,Scand J Infect Dis,"Chui KS, et al.

24227856,Inhibition of Bim enhances replication of varicella-zoster virus and delays plaque formation in virus-infected cells.,"Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is an important host defense mechanism against intracellular pathogens, such as viruses. Accordingly, viruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to modulate apoptosis to enhance replication. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) induces apoptosis in human fibroblasts and melanoma cells. We found that VZV triggered the phosphorylation of the proapoptotic proteins Bim and BAD but had little or no effect on other Bcl-2 family members. Since phosphorylation of Bim and BAD reduces their proapoptotic activity, this may prevent or delay apoptosis in VZV-infected cells. Phosphorylation of Bim but not BAD in VZV-infected cells was dependent on activation of the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Cells knocked down for Bim showed delayed VZV plaque formation, resulting in longer survival of VZV-infected cells and increased replication of virus, compared with wild-type cells infected with virus. Conversely, overexpression of Bim resulted in earlier plaque formation, smaller plaques, reduced virus replication, and increased caspase 3 activity. Inhibition of caspase activity in VZV-infected cells overexpressing Bim restored levels of virus production similar to those seen with virus-infected wild-type cells. Previously we showed that VZV ORF12 activates ERK and inhibits apoptosis in virus-infected cells. Here we found that VZV ORF12 contributes to Bim and BAD phosphorylation. In summary, VZV triggers Bim phosphorylation; reduction of Bim levels results in longer survival of VZV-infected cells and increased VZV replication.","['Liu X', 'Cohen JI']",2014,88,2,J Virol,Liu X and Cohen JI.

24204928,Varicella vaccination alters the chronological trends of herpes zoster and varicella.,"BACKGROUND: Population studies on trends of varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) associated with varicella zoster vaccination and climate is limited.
METHODS: This study used insurance claims data to investigate the chronological changes in incident varicella and HZ associated with varicella zoster vaccination. Poisson regression was used to estimate the occurrence of varicella associated with the occurrence of HZ and vice versa by year, season, sex, temperature, and sunny hours.
RESULTS: The varicella incidence declined from 7.14 to 0.76 per 1,000 person-years in 2000-2009, whereas the HZ incidence increased from 4.04 to 6.24 per 1,000 person-years. Females tended to have a higher risk than men for HZ (p<0.0001) but not varicella. The monthly mean varicella incidence was the lowest in September (160 cases) and the highest in January (425 cases), while the mean HZ incidence was lower in February (370 cases) and higher in August (470 cases). HZ was negatively associated with the incidence of varicella before and after the varicella zoster vaccination (p<0.001), increased 1.6% within one week post-vaccination. The effect of temperature on HZ was attenuated by 18.5% (p<0.0001) in association with vaccination. The varicella risk was positively associated with sun exposure hours, but negatively associated with temperature only before vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: The varicella vaccination is effective in varicella prevention, but the incidence of HZ increases after vaccination. HZ has a stronger association with temperature and UV than with seasonality while varicella risk associated with temperature and UV is diminished.","['Wu PY', 'Wu HD', 'Chou TC', 'Sung FC']",2013,8,10,PLoS One,"Wu PY, et al.

24198400,Autophagy and the effects of its inhibition on varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein biosynthesis and infectivity.,"Autophagy and the effects of its inhibition or induction were investigated during the entire infectious cycle of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a human herpesvirus. As a baseline, we first enumerated the number of autophagosomes per cell after VZV infection compared with the number after induction of autophagy following serum starvation or treatment with tunicamycin or trehalose. Punctum induction by VZV was similar in degree to punctum induction by trehalose in uninfected cells. Treatment of infected cells with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) markedly reduced the viral titer, as determined by assays measuring both cell-free virus and infectious foci (P < 0.0001). We next examined a virion-enriched band purified by density gradient sedimentation and observed that treatment with 3-MA decreased the amount of VZV gE, while treatment with trehalose increased the amount of gE in the same band. Because VZV gE is the most abundant glycoprotein, we selected gE as a representative viral glycoprotein. To further investigate the role of autophagy in VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis as well as confirm the results obtained with 3-MA inhibition, we transfected cells with ATG5 small interfering RNA to block autophagosome formation. VZV-induced syncytium formation was markedly reduced by ATG5 knockdown (P < 0.0001). Further, we found that both expression and glycan processing of VZV gE were decreased after ATG5 knockdown, while expression of the nonglycosylated IE62 tegument protein was unchanged. Taken together, our cumulative results not only documented abundant autophagy within VZV-infected cells throughout the infectious cycle but also demonstrated that VZV-induced autophagy facilitated VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing.","['Buckingham EM', 'Carpenter JE', 'Jackson W', 'Grose C']",2014,88,2,J Virol,"Buckingham EM, et al.

24183712,Long-term clinical studies of varicella vaccine at a regional hospital in Japan and proposal for a varicella vaccination program.,"In 1974, a live varicella vaccine (Oka strain) was developed in Japan for the prevention of varicella. It has been commercially available since 1987 for the voluntary vaccination program, in which children over the age of 1 year with no history of previous varicella infection receive a single dose. From before approval up to the present, we have been carrying out long-term studies in healthy children at a regional hospital to assess the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of the varicella vaccine. This vaccine is very safe, and serious adverse reactions have not been observed since the year 2000 when it changed gelatin-free. In the past three studies, seroconversion was detected in around 95% of subjects by the immune adherence hemagglutination (IAHA) test, and this high rate was considered to indicate good immunogenicity. Breakthrough varicella is observed in approximately 20-30% of children who receive a single dose of the vaccine, but most cases are mild. Although recent vaccination has generally been effective, the IAHA test has shown that immunogenicity is somewhat lower than was previously demonstrated. The sensitivity of the IAHA test has been shown to be adequate when compared with the neutralization test, so the current testing system is sufficient for the maintenance of immunity levels. An additional vaccination increased the IAHA antibody level in subjects who failed to seroconvert after a single dose vaccination. According to another clinical study, additional varicella vaccination at 3-5 years after the initial vaccination achieved stronger immunogenicity. Because it is administered as part of the voluntary vaccination program, the varicella vaccination coverage rate has remained low in Japan, with no sign of a decrease in the number of varicella patients. We consider that implementation of routine varicella vaccination program based on the Preventive Vaccination Law would be the most effective approach for improvement of the coverage rate. Along with this, introduction of a two-dose schedule would also be desirable. In addition to decreasing the prevalence of characteristic breakthrough varicella infection, the vaccination coverage rate would also be expected to improve with a two-dose schedule due to an increase in opportunities for vaccination.",['Ozaki T'],2013,31,51,Vaccine,Ozaki T.

24176291,Risk factors for susceptibility to varicella in newly arrived adult migrants in Canada.,"Varicella occurs at an older age in tropical compared to cold climates. Migrants from tropical countries provide the opportunity to gain insights into observed global differences in varicella epidemiology. Severity of varicella increases with age thus, description of risk factors for varicella susceptibility will identify those who would benefit most from vaccination. A total of 1480 migrants, with a mean age of 32 years, were recruited in the pre-vaccination period (2002-2004) in Montreal, Canada. A questionnaire was administered and serum varicella antibodies were measured. Overall 6% were susceptible and ranged from 0·8% to 14·1% in subgroups. Risk factors for susceptibility were younger age, recent arrival, and originating from a tropical country. This could be modified by conditions that increased the probability of person-to-person spread of varicella through direct contact in source countries such as larger community size or household crowding. Many new young adult migrants would benefit from targeted varicella vaccination programmes.","['Greenaway C', 'Boivin JF', 'Cnossen S', 'Rossi C', 'Tapiero B', 'Schwartzman K', 'Olson S', 'Miller M']",2014,142,8,Epidemiol Infect,"Greenaway C, et al.

24163530,Chemical reconstruction of skin scars therapy using 100% trichloroacetic Acid in the treatment of atrophic facial post varicella scars: a pilot study.,"CONTEXT: Chickenpox (varicella) is a common viral disease caused by Varicella zoster virus. Facial atrophic scars after varicella infection are not uncommon and pose a cosmetic problem. Like atrophic scars of other aetiologies, they are a difficult condition to treat. There are not enough references in the literature regarding efficient treatment of post varicella scars. High strength Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), which is known to cause dermal collagen remodelling, was used to treat varicella scars in the present study.
AIMS: The study was undertaken to assess the efficiency of Chemical Reconstruction of Skin Scars (CROSS) technique using 100% TCA in the treatment of atrophic facial post varicella scars.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Open label, pilot study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 16 patients with atrophic facial post varicella scars were treated by focal application of 100% TCA solution by pressing down upon the scar surface by a toothpick (CROSS technique). Total 4 sittings were given at 2 weekly intervals and the results evaluated after 3 months of follow-up. Statistical analysis was carried out using Fischer's exact t-test.
RESULTS: All of the 13 patients who completed the study showed good clinical improvement, with 69% patients grading the response as excellent (>75%) improvement, whereas the rest 31% patients reporting good (51-75%) improvement. No significant complications were seen in any patient.

24162921,Deep sequencing of viral genomes provides insight into the evolution and pathogenesis of varicella zoster virus and its vaccine in humans.,"Immunization with the vOka vaccine prevents varicella (chickenpox) in children and susceptible adults. The vOka vaccine strain comprises a mixture of genotypes and, despite attenuation, causes rashes in small numbers of recipients. Like wild-type virus, the vaccine establishes latency in neuronal tissue and can later reactivate to cause Herpes zoster (shingles). Using hybridization-based methodologies, we have purified and sequenced vOka directly from skin lesions. We show that alleles present in the vaccine can be recovered from the lesions and demonstrate the presence of a severe bottleneck between inoculation and lesion formation. Genotypes in any one lesion appear to be descended from one to three vaccine-genotypes with a low frequency of novel mutations. No single vOka haplotype and no novel mutations are consistently present in rashes, indicating that neither new mutations nor recombination with wild type are critical to the evolution of vOka rashes. Instead, alleles arising from attenuation (i.e., not derived from free-living virus) are present at lower frequencies in rash genotypes. We identify 11 loci at which the ancestral allele is selected for in vOka rash formation and show genotypes in rashes that have reactivated from latency cannot be distinguished from rashes occurring immediately after inoculation. We conclude that the vOka vaccine, although heterogeneous, has not evolved to form rashes through positive selection in the mode of a quasispecies, but rather alleles that were essentially neutral during the vaccine production have been selected against in the human subjects, allowing us to identify key loci for rash formation.","['Depledge DP', 'Kundu S', 'Jensen NJ', 'Gray ER', 'Jones M', 'Steinberg S', 'Gershon A', 'Kinchington PR', 'Schmid DS', 'Balloux F', 'Nichols RA', 'Breuer J']",2014,31,2,Mol Biol Evol,"Depledge DP, et al.

24136373,Impact of varicella vaccination on varicella-related hospitalizations among American Indian/Alaska Native people.,"BACKGROUND: Routine childhood varicella vaccination, implemented in 1995, has resulted in significant declines in varicella-related hospitalizations in the United States. Varicella hospitalization rates among the American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) population have not been previously documented.
METHODS: We selected varicella-related hospitalizations, based on a published definition, from the Indian Health Service inpatient database for AI/ANs in the Alaska, Southwest and Northern Plains regions (1995-2010) and from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the general US population (2007-2010). We analyzed average annual hospitalization rates prevaccine (1995-1998) and postvaccine (2007-2010) for the AI/AN population, and postvaccine for the general US population.
RESULTS: From 1995-1998 to 2007-2010, the average annual varicella-related hospitalization rate for AI/ANs in the 3 regions decreased 95% (0.66-0.03/10,000 persons); the postvaccine rate appears lower than the general US rate (0.06, 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.06). The rate declined in all AI/AN pediatric age groups. Infants experienced the highest prevaccine (14.07) and postvaccine (0.83) hospitalization rates. Adults experienced low rates in both periods. Varicella vaccination rates in 19- to 35-month-old AI/AN children during fiscal years 2008-2010 were 88.1-91.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Widespread use of varicella vaccine in AI/AN children was accompanied by substantial declines in varicella-related hospitalizations consistent with high varicella vaccine effectiveness in preventing severe varicella outcomes.","['Singleton RJ', 'Holman RC', 'Person MK', 'Steiner CA', 'Redd JT', 'Hennessy TW', 'Groom A', 'Holve S', 'Seward JF']",2014,33,3,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Singleton RJ, et al.

24127236,Interaction of allergy history and antibodies to specific varicella-zoster virus proteins on glioma risk.,"Glioma is the most common cancer of the central nervous system but with few confirmed risk factors. It has been inversely associated with chicken pox, shingles and seroreactivity to varicella virus (VZV), as well as to allergies and allergy-associated IgE. The role of antibody reactivity against individual VZV antigens has not been assessed. Ten VZV-related proteins, selected for high immunogenicity or known function, were synthesized and used as targets for antibody measurements in the sera of 143 glioma cases and 131 healthy controls selected from the San Francisco Bay Area Adult Glioma Study. Glioma cases exhibited significantly reduced seroreactivity compared to controls for six antigens, including proteins IE63 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12-0.58, comparing lowest quartile to highest) and the VZV-unique protein ORF2p (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.96, lowest quartile to highest). When stratifying the study population into those with low and high self-reported allergy history, VZV protein seroreactivity was only associated inversely with glioma among individuals self-reporting more than two allergies. The data provide insight into both allergy and VZV effects on glioma: strong anti-VZV reactions in highly allergic individuals are associated with reduced occurrence of glioma. This result suggests a role for specificity in the anti-VZV immunity in brain tumor suppression for both individual VZV antigens and in the fine-tuning of the immune response by allergy. Anti-VZV reactions may also be a biomarker of effective CNS immunosurveillance owing to the tropism of the virus.","['Lee ST', 'Bracci P', 'Zhou M', 'Rice T', 'Wiencke J', 'Wrensch M', 'Wiemels J']",2014,134,9,Int J Cancer,"Lee ST, et al.

EXPOSURES Any measles-containing vaccines and measles-containing vaccines by type. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fever and seizure events occurring during a 42-day postimmunization observation period. RESULTS In the analysis of any measles-containing vaccines, the increased risk of seizures during the 7- to 10-day risk interval, using the remainder of the observation period as the control interval, was significantly greater among older children (relative risk, 6.5; 95% CI, 5.3-8.1; attributable risk, 9.5 excess cases per 10,000 doses; 95% CI, 7.6-11.5) than among younger children (relative risk, 3.4; 95% CI, 3.0-3.9; attributable risk = 4.0 excess cases per 10,000 doses; 95% CI, 3.4-4.6). The relative risk of postimmunization fever was significantly greater among older children than among younger children; however, its attributable risk was not. In the analysis of vaccine type, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine was associated with a 1.4-fold increase in the risk of fever and 2-fold increase in the risk of seizures compared with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine administered with or without varicella vaccine in both younger and older children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Measles-containing vaccines are associated with a lower increased risk of seizures when administered at 12 to 15 months of age. Findings of this study that focused on safety outcomes highlight the importance of timely immunization of children with the first dose of measles-containing vaccines.","['Rowhani-Rahbar A', 'Fireman B', 'Lewis E', 'Nordin J', 'Naleway A', 'Jacobsen SJ', 'Jackson LA', 'Tse A', 'Belongia EA', 'Hambidge SJ', 'Weintraub E', 'Baxter R', 'Klein NP']",2013,167,12,JAMA Pediatr,"Rowhani-Rahbar A, et al.

His routine immunizations were up-to-date. His parents reported a high temperature (up to 39.5°C) in the preceding 48 hours and that he also had a mild cough, episodes of vomiting and loose stools. He had fed poorly in the 24 hours before presentation. Clinical assessment revealed a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate 130/min, respiratory rate of 34/min and crusted chickenpox lesions. The infant was alert, smiling and playful, and systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable. He was admitted for monitoring of his fluid intake and temperature. As the infant continued to vomit intermittently in the 6 hours post admission, blood investigations were done and intravenous fluids were commenced. Laboratory investigations did not reveal biochemical evidence of dehydration, but they did show raised inflammatory markers: white blood cell count 24.8 × 109/litre, neutrophil count 19.8 × 109/litre and C-reactive protein 227mg/litre. In view of these results and the ongoing high fever, a chest X-ray was performed, revealing right upper lobe consolidation and collapse (Figure 1). Oral amoxicillin and flucloxacillin were started and oral feeding was successfully reestablished over the next 24 hours. He was discharged home after 48 hours, to complete a full 7-day course of oral antibiotics.","['Paul SP', 'Abdelrhim H', 'Kane M', 'Haque SY']",2013,74,10,Br J Hosp Med (Lond),"Paul SP, et al.

24101763,Impact of a routine two-dose varicella vaccination program on varicella epidemiology.,"OBJECTIVE: One-dose varicella vaccination for children was introduced in the United States in 1995. In 2006, a second dose was recommended to further decrease varicella disease and outbreaks. We describe the impact of the 2-dose vaccination program on varicella incidence, severity, and outbreaks in 2 varicella active surveillance areas.
METHODS: We examined varicella incidence rates and disease characteristics in Antelope Valley (AV), CA, and West Philadelphia, PA, and varicella outbreak characteristics in AV during 1995-2010.
RESULTS: In 2010, varicella incidence was 0.3 cases per 1000 population in AV and 0.1 cases per 1000 population in West Philadelphia: 76% and 67% declines, respectively, since 2006 and 98% declines in both sites since 1995; incidence declined in all age groups during 2006-2010. From 2006-2010, 61.7% of case patients in both surveillance areas had been vaccinated with 1 dose of varicella vaccine and 7.5% with 2 doses. Most vaccinated case patients had <50 lesions with no statistically significant differences among 1- and 2-dose cases (62.8% and 70.3%, respectively). Varicella-related hospitalizations during 2006-2010 declined >40% compared with 2002-2005 and >85% compared with 1995-1998. Twelve varicella outbreaks occurred in AV during 2007-2010, compared with 47 during 2003-2006 and 236 during 1995-1998 (P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella incidence, hospitalizations, and outbreaks in 2 active surveillance areas declined substantially during the first 5 years of the 2-dose varicella vaccination program. Declines in incidence across all ages, including infants who are not eligible for varicella vaccination, and adults, in whom vaccination levels are low, provide evidence of the benefit of high levels of immunity in the population.","['Bialek SR', 'Perella D', 'Zhang J', 'Mascola L', 'Viner K', 'Jackson C', 'Lopez AS', 'Watson B', 'Civen R']",2013,132,5,Pediatrics,"Bialek SR, et al.

24097851,Peripheral facial palsy in children.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the types and clinical characteristics of peripheral facial palsy in children. The hospital charts of children diagnosed with peripheral facial palsy were reviewed retrospectively. A total of 81 children (42 female and 39 male) with a mean age of 9.2 ± 4.3 years were included in the study. Causes of facial palsy were 65 (80.2%) idiopathic (Bell palsy) facial palsy, 9 (11.1%) otitis media/mastoiditis, and tumor, trauma, congenital facial palsy, chickenpox, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, enlarged lymph nodes, and familial Mediterranean fever (each 1; 1.2%). Five (6.1%) patients had recurrent attacks. In patients with Bell palsy, female/male and right/left ratios were 36/29 and 35/30, respectively. Of them, 31 (47.7%) had a history of preceding infection. The overall rate of complete recovery was 98.4%. A wide variety of disorders can present with peripheral facial palsy in children. Therefore, careful investigation and differential diagnosis is essential.","['Yılmaz U', 'Cubukçu D', 'Yılmaz TS', 'Akıncı G', 'Ozcan M', 'Güzel O']",2014,29,11,J Child Neurol,"Yılmaz U, et al.

24097085,Impact of the duration of antiviral prophylaxis on rates of varicella-zoster virus reactivation disease in autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is a relatively common cause of morbidity following autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (auto-HCT). The Centers for Disease Control in 2009 recommended extending VZV prophylaxis for 1 year post-transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed rates of VZV reactivation following auto-HCT at our transplant center prior to and after the implementation of extended antiviral prophylaxis in June 2008. The study population was divided into three different cohorts according to the length of VZV prophylaxis as following: (1) prophylaxis until neutrophil recovery to ≥500/μL (n = 77), (2) prophylaxis for 6 months (n = 12), or (3) 12 months (n = 40) post-auto-HCT. All patients received acyclovir 400 mg oral or intravenously twice daily or valacyclovir 500 mg oral daily. For patients in whom VZV reactivation occurred, data was collected on severity of infection, time of onset, treatment, and any associated complications. One hundred twenty-nine patients undergoing auto-HCT between January 1, 2004 and January 31, 2010 were included in the study. There was a significant difference in the rates of VZV reactivation between the neutrophil recovery and 12 months prophylaxis cohorts at 14 % (n = 11) and 2 % (n = 1) (P = 0.04), respectively. VZV reactivation rate in the 6-month prophylaxis group was 17 % (n = 2), but did not reach statistical significance due to small numbers. In the subset of auto-HCT patients treated with bortezomib, 13 % (n = 2) developed VZV reactivation in the neutrophil recovery group, while no events occurred in the other two cohorts. Complications of VZV reactivation include post-herpetic neuralgia (n = 5), severe pain (n = 3), scarring (n = 1), and motor weakness (n = 1); two patients required hospitalization and three patients developed disseminated zoster. Our limited retrospective analysis suggests a significant reduction in rates of post-auto-HCT rates of VZV reactivation with extended 12 months antiviral prophylaxis. VZV reactivation is a significant complication post-auto-HCT, and extended prophylaxis appears to be safe and effective in this setting.","['Truong Q', 'Veltri L', 'Kanate AS', 'Hu Y', 'Craig M', 'Hamadani M', 'Cumpston A']",2014,93,4,Ann Hematol,"Truong Q, et al.

24094542,Childhood atopic dermatitis and warts are associated with increased risk of infection: a US population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested that atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with aberrant immune responses, which might predispose toward both cutaneous and extracutaneous infections. The goal of this study was to determine whether childhood AD is associated with increased risk of warts, extracutaneous infections, and other atopic diseases and how these disorders cosegregate.
METHODS: The 2007 National Health Interview Survey from a nationally representative sample of 9417 children age 0 to 17 years was used.
RESULTS: Children with AD and other atopic disease had higher odds of warts. In contrast, children with AD with or without other atopic disease had higher odds of extracutaneous infections, including strep throat, other sore throat, head or chest cold, influenza/pneumonia, sinus infections, recurrent ear infections, chickenpox, and urinary tract infections (P < .0001). Children with AD and other atopic disease had a higher number of infections than those with either disorder by itself (P < .0001). Warts were also associated with increased odds of all extracutaneous infections (P < .0001), except recurrent ear infections. Children with warts and AD had a higher number of infections than those with either disorder alone (P < .0001). Finally, children with AD and warts had higher odds of ever receiving a diagnosis of asthma, current asthma, asthma exacerbation in the past year, hay fever, and food allergy. Children with AD with warts had even higher odds of asthma, hay fever, and food allergies than those with AD and no warts.
CONCLUSIONS: The associations between childhood AD, atopic disease, warts, and extracutaneous infections suggest that barrier disruption, immune disruption, or both contribute to susceptibility to warts and extracutaneous infections in children.","['Silverberg JI', 'Silverberg NB']",2014,133,4,J Allergy Clin Immunol,Silverberg JI and Silverberg NB.

24093779,The role of VariZIG in pregnancy.,"Varicella infection during pregnancy is associated with serious maternal and fetal complications such as congenital varicella syndrome, maternal pneumonia and neonatal varicella. Pregnant women are ineligible to receive the varicella vaccination, thus women who lack evidence of immunity to varicella are at an increased risk for developing a varicella infection if exposed to a contagious individual. Presently, post-exposure prophylaxis involves the administration of a varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VariZIG™) to prevent or reduce the severity of an infection. The US FDA recently approved VariZIG for licensure and recommend that it be administered as soon as possible following VZV exposure, ideally within 96 h for greatest effectiveness. The following review critically examines the role of VariZIG in post-exposure prophylaxis of varicella during pregnancy.","['Bapat P', 'Koren G']",2013,12,11,Expert Rev Vaccines,Bapat P and Koren G.

Fortunately, modern advances, including an available vaccine to prevent varicella, a therapeutic vaccine to diminish the incidence and ameliorate sequelae of HZ, effective antiviral drugs, a better understanding of VZV pathogenesis, and advances in diagnostic virology have made it possible to control VZV in the United States. Occult forms of VZV-induced disease have been recognized, including zoster sine herpete and enteric zoster, which have expanded the field. Future progress should include development of more effective vaccines to prevent HZ and a more complete understanding of the consequences of VZV latency in the enteric nervous system.","['Gershon AA', 'Gershon MD']",2013,26,4,Clin Microbiol Rev,Gershon AA and Gershon MD.

24092802,Chickenpox and risk of stroke: a self-controlled case series analysis.,"BACKGROUND: There is good evidence that respiratory and other infections that cause systemic inflammation can trigger strokes; however, the role of specific infections is unclear. Case reports have highlighted chickenpox as a possible risk factor for arterial ischemic stroke, particularly in children, but rigorous studies are needed to determine and quantify any increased risk.
METHODS: We used anonymized electronic health records totaling >100 million person-years of observation from 4 UK primary care databases to identify individuals who had documented clinical chickenpox and a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Self-controlled case series methods were used to quantify any increased risk of first stroke or TIA in the 0-6 and 7-12 months following chickenpox compared to other observed time periods. We analyzed data within each database, and performed meta-analyses to obtain summary age-adjusted incidence ratios (IRs) separately for adults and children.
RESULTS: Five hundred sixty eligible individuals (including 60 children) were identified who experienced chickenpox and a stroke or TIA during follow-up. Among children, there was a 4-fold increased risk of stroke in the 0-6 months after chickenpox (summary IR = 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.96-8.45; I(2) = 0%). Among adults, there was a less marked increased risk with moderate between-database heterogeneity (random-effects summary IR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.05-4.36; I(2) = 51%). There was no significant increased risk of stroke in the 7-12 months after chickenpox in children or adults, nor was there evidence of increased risk of TIA in either time period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new evidence that children who experience chickenpox are at increased risk of stroke in the subsequent 6 months.","['Thomas SL', 'Minassian C', 'Ganesan V', 'Langan SM', 'Smeeth L']",2014,58,1,Clin Infect Dis,"Thomas SL, et al.

Little is known about the effect of meteorological variables on varicella infection risk for children. This study described the epidemiology of paediatric varicella notifications in Hong Kong from 2004 to 2010, and explored the association between paediatric varicella notifications in children aged <18 years and various meteorological factors using a time-stratified case-crossover model, with adjustment of potential confounding factors. The analysis found that daily mean temperature, atmospheric pressure and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were positively associated with paediatric varicella notifications. We found that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in temperature (8·38°C) at lag 1 day, a 9·50 hPa increase in atmospheric pressure for the current day, and a 21·91 unit increase in SOI for the current day may lead to an increase in daily cases of 5·19% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1·90-8·58], 5·77% (95% CI 3·01-8·61), and 4·32% (95% CI 2·98-5·68), respectively.

24072056,[Viral encephalitis in children].,"Viral encephalitis is a severe illness that produces inflammation of the brain. CNS viral infections frequently occur as a complication of systemic viral infections. Over 100 viruses are implicated as causative agents, including herpes simplex virus type I which is the most common agent implied in non-epidemic encephalitis in all population groups in the world, and is responsible for the most severe cases in all ages. Many viruses, for which there are vaccines, may also cause encephalitis: measles, mumps, polio, rabies, rubella, and chickenpox. The virus causes an inflammation of the brain tissue, which may progress to destruction of nerve cells, cause bleeding and brain damage, leading to severe encephalitis, such as hemorrhagic or necrotizing encephalitis, with a worse prognosis, producing serious sequelae or death. The clinical evolution includes the presence of headache, fever and altered consciousness rapidly progressive. The outcome of viral encephalitis is variable, some cases are mild, with full recovery, but there are serious cases that can cause severe sequel in the brain. To diagnose this illness as soon as possible is essential, through laboratory tests (biochemistry, virus PCR, culture) and neuroimaging (CT, MRI) and above all, the establishment of early treatment to prevent the development of the process and possible complications.

24040715,Chickenpox in Poland in 2011.,"INTRODUCTION: A number of chickenpox cases which occur in children indicate the rationality of the use of preventive vaccination. In Poland since 2002, chickenpox vaccination is recommended.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2011 and to compare with the situation in the previous years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Assessment of the epidemiological situation chickenpox in 2011 in Poland was based on analysis of the data published in the annual bulletins: ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2011."" and ""Immunization Safety in Poland in 2011 (Czarkowski MP. Et al., Warsaw, NIPH-NIH, GIS). In addition, on data from the ""Immunization Program for 2011"" (Annex to the Statement of the Chief Sanitary Inspector on Oct. 28, 2010).
RESULTS: In 2011. 172 855 registered cases of chickenpox were registered in Poland n 2011. Incidence was 448.7/100. It was lower than in 2010. (480.4/100,000). Highest incidence was in Mazowieckie, the lowest in Podlaskie. Across the age groups the highest incidence (3708.7/100,000) was reported in age group 5-9. The incidence of chickenpox in men (472.3/100,000) was higher than in women (426.5/100,000). In inhabitants of rural areas it was higher (473.5) than among urban residents (432.7/100,000). Number of hospitalized cases was 1 016. Number of people vaccinated against chickenpox amounted to 38 943 people.
SUMMARY: In 2011 there was small decrease in the incidence of chickenpox. But the rising trend is continuing in Poland since 2004. It can be partly be explained by improved surveillance of the disease. Overall high incidence of chickenpox brings problem of widespread vaccination of children.","['Lipke M', 'Paradowska-Stankiewicz I']",2013,67,2,Przegl Epidemiol,"Lipke M and Paradowska-Stankiewicz I.

24037981,Serology indicates cytomegalovirus infection is associated with varicella-zoster virus reactivation.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox after which the virus remains latent in neural ganglia. Subsequent reactivation episodes occur, leading mainly to subclinical detection of VZV, but also to the clinical entity herpes zoster. These reactivations are known to occur most frequently amongst immunocompromised individuals, but the incidence of herpes zoster is also known to increase with age, supposedly as a consequence of immunosenescence. Our analysis aims to explore associations between cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and VZV reactivation by analyzing VZV-specific antibody titers as a function of age, gender, and CMV serostatus. The analysis was repeated on measles and parvovirus B19 antibody titers. At the time of the observations, measles virus circulation was virtually eliminated, whereas parvovirus B19 circulated at lower levels than VZV. Multiple linear regression analyses, using the log-transformed antibody titers, identified a positive association between ageing and VZV antibody titers suggesting that ageing increasingly stimulates VZV reactivation. CMV infection further amplified the positive association between ageing and the reactivation rate. A negative association between CMV infection and VZV antibody titers was found in young individuals, thereby supporting the hypothesis that CMV infection may have a negative effect on the number of B-cells. However, no associations between CMV infection and measles or parvovirus B19 antibody titers occurred, but ageing tended to be associated with a decrease in the antibody titer against parvovirus B19. The combined results thus suggest that both CMV-dependent and CMV-independent immunosenescence occurs.

24010891,"Deprivation, timing of preschool infections and H. pylori seropositivity at age 49-51 years: the Newcastle Thousand Families birth cohort.","BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection is acquired in early childhood and persists for life (or until eradication treatment is taken). Seropositivity of H. pylori at age 49-51 years was assessed in relation to socio-economic deprivation in early life and the timing of other childhood infections common at that time.
METHODS: Prospectively collected socio-economic and morbidity data from the Newcastle Thousand Families study, a birth cohort established in 1947. H. pylori IgG seropositivity was assessed at 49-51 years and examined in relation to both whether the individual had been diagnosed with one of measles, mumps or chicken pox, and, if so, the age at first infection. This was done in logistic regression models, allowing adjustment for socio-economic status and housing quality in childhood.
RESULTS: Adult H. pylori status was strongly linked to disadvantaged socio-economic status in early life (p ≤ 0.002), unlike measles, mumps and chicken pox which showed no associations. Early measles infection was independently associated with H. pylori seropositivity (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Of the four infectious diseases that we have studied, it appears that H. pylori differs from the others by the strength of association with socio economic deprivation in early childhood. Our findings further highlight the complex interaction between measles, childhood infections and other non-microbiological factors that occur within a whole population. These data suggest a strong association between H. pylori and deprivation and raise the possibility of an interaction between early measles exposure and increased risk of exposure to H. pylori infection.","['Pearce MS', 'Campbell DI', 'Mann KD', 'Parker L', 'Thomas JE']",2013,13,,BMC Infect Dis,"Pearce MS, et al.

24010815,Bacterial artificial chromosome derived simian varicella virus is pathogenic in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that infects humans and results in chickenpox and herpes zoster. A number of VZV genes remain functionally uncharacterized and since VZV is an obligate human pathogen, rigorous evaluation of VZV mutants in vivo remains challenging. Simian varicella virus (SVV) is homologous to VZV and SVV infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely mimics VZV infection of humans. Recently the SVV genome was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and BAC-derived SVV displayed similar replication kinetics as wild-type (WT) SVV in vitro.
METHODS: RMs were infected with BAC-derived SVV or WT SVV at 4x10(5) PFU intrabronchially (N=8, 4 per group, sex and age matched). We collected whole blood (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at various days post-infection (dpi) and sensory ganglia during latent infection (>84 dpi) at necropsy and compared disease progression, viral replication, immune response and the establishment of latency.
RESULTS: Viral replication kinetics and magnitude in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and whole blood as well as rash severity and duration were similar in RMs infected with SVV BAC or WT SVV. Moreover, SVV-specific B and T cell responses were comparable between BAC and WT-infected animals. Lastly, we measured viral DNA in sensory ganglia from both cohorts of infected RMs during latent infection.
CONCLUSIONS: SVV BAC is as pathogenic and immunogenic as WT SVV in vivo. Thus, the SVV BAC genetic system combined with the rhesus macaque animal model can further our understanding of viral ORFs important for VZV pathogenesis and the development of second-generation vaccines.","['Meyer C', 'Dewane J', 'Haberthur K', 'Engelmann F', 'Arnold N', 'Gray W', 'Messaoudi I']",2013,10,,Virol J,"Meyer C, et al.

This study evaluated the VZV seroprevalence in this high risk population in Babol, Iran.
METHODS: Serological testing for VZV using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed on 459 HCWs in Ayatollah Rouhani Hospital, Babol, Northern Iran from 2011 to 2012. A questionnaire was completed including age, gender, place of residence, marital status, history of chickenpox, educational level, working experience and risk of exposure. The data were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age of these subjects was 32.2±1.1 years. Four hundred-sixteen (90.6%) cases were females and 43 (9.4%) were males. The overall positive seroprevalence of VZV was 94.6%. No statistically significant differences were observed between age, gender, place of residence, risk of exposure, marital status, educational level, working experience and seropositivity. The seropositivity of varicella was seen in 278 (95.5%) of 297 cases with positive history and in 30 (81.1%) of 37 cases who did not (p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: The results show that a positive history of VZV is associated with positive seroprevalence but can not be a reliable indicator of the immunity, therefore, serological screening should be considered for all the HCWs.","['Bayani M', 'Hasanjani-Roushan MR', 'Siadati S', 'Javanian M', 'Sadeghi-Haddad-Zavareh M', 'Shokri M', 'Mohammadpour M', 'Zarghami A', 'Asghari S']",2013,4,3,Caspian J Intern Med,"Bayani M, et al.

24008377,Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-human neuron interaction.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a highly neurotropic, exclusively human herpesvirus. Primary infection causes varicella (chickenpox), wherein VZV replicates in multiple organs, particularly the skin. Widespread infection in vivo is confirmed by the ability of VZV to kill tissue culture cells in vitro derived from any organ. After varicella, VZV becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. During latency, virus DNA replication stops, transcription is restricted, and no progeny virions are produced, indicating a unique virus-cell (neuron) relationship. VZV reactivation produces zoster (shingles), often complicated by serious neurological and ocular disorders. The molecular trigger(s) for reactivation, and thus the identity of a potential target to prevent it, remains unknown due to an incomplete understanding of the VZV-neuron interaction. While no in vitro system has yet recapitulated the findings in latently infected ganglia, recent studies show that VZV infection of human neurons in SCID mice and of human stem cells, including induced human pluripotent stem cells and normal human neural progenitor tissue-like assemblies, can be established in the absence of a cytopathic effect. Usefulness of these systems in discovering the mechanisms underlying reactivation awaits analyses of VZV-infected, highly pure (>90%), terminally differentiated human neurons capable of prolonged survival in vitro.","['Baird NL', 'Yu X', 'Cohrs RJ', 'Gilden D']",2013,5,9,Viruses,"Baird NL, et al.

23999562,The global epidemiology of herpes zoster.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous, highly neurotropic, exclusively human α-herpesvirus. Primary infection usually results in varicella (chickenpox), after which VZV becomes latent in neurons of cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and autonomic ganglia along the entire neuraxis. As humans undergo a natural decline in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) to VZV with age, VZV frequently reactivates to produce zoster, characterized by maculopapular or vesicular rash and dermatomal-distribution pain. Pain and rash usually occur within days of each other. Pain is severe and often burning. Colorful descriptions of zoster exist worldwide. In Arabic, Hezam innar ( ) means belt of fire; in Hindi, Baoisayaa daga ( ) means big rash; in Norwegian, Helvetesild means Hell's fire (also described as a bell of roses from Hell); and in Spanish, Culebrilla means small snake.(1) The most common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), operationally defined as pain lasting for more than 90 days after rash. Zoster may be followed by multiple neurologic disorders (meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and vasculopathy, including VZV temporal arteritis) as well as ocular disease (acute or progressive outer retinal necrosis).","['Yawn BP', 'Gilden D']",2013,81,10,Neurology,Yawn BP and Gilden D.

23994286,Antihistamine use and immunoglobulin E levels in glioma risk and prognosis.,"OBJECTIVE: An inverse association between personal history of allergies/asthma and glioma risk has been fairly consistently reported in the epidemiologic literature. However, the role of regular antihistamine use remains controversial due to a small number of studies reporting contradictory findings. We evaluated the association between regular use of oral antihistamines and glioma risk, adjusting for a number of relevant factors (e.g., immunoglobulin E levels and history of chickenpox).
METHODS: We used a subset of the Harris County Case-Control Study, which included 362 pathologically confirmed glioma cases and 462 cancer-free controls, to evaluate this association using unconditional multivariable logistic regression. These models were run among the overall study population and stratified by allergy status. Cox regression was utilized to examine whether antihistamine use was associated with mortality among all cases and separately among high-grade cases.
RESULTS: Antihistamine use was strongly associated with glioma risk among those with a positive allergy/asthma history (OR: 4.19, 95% CI: 2.06-8.51), but not among those with a negative history (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 0.95-2.67). There were no significant associations between antihistamine use and survival among cases.
CONCLUSION: The current study implies that regular antihistamine use may increase glioma risk. However, several larger studies are necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn.","['Amirian ES', 'Marquez-Do D', 'Bondy ML', 'Scheurer ME']",2013,37,6,Cancer Epidemiol,"Amirian ES, et al.

23990095,[Varicella vaccination in Germany. A provisional appraisal in the context of MMR vaccination].,"In 2004, a general varicella immunization was introduced in Germany for infants from the age of 11 months, followed by the subsequent recommendation in 2009 of a second vaccine dose. The vaccination is carried out at the same time as the immunization against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). Results of the nationwide sentinel surveillance of varicella and herpes zoster implemented by the Varicella Working Group (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Varizellen, AGV) show that the defined goals for varicella immunization (reduction of varicella-related morbidity, complications and hospitalizations) have been reached within a few years owing to the advances in vaccine coverage. Although coverage rates for varicella have not yet reached the same levels as for MMR, varicella immunization seems to have benefited from the established MMR immunization schedule. Moreover, there is no evidence for an adverse effect on the use and acceptance of the MMR vaccine. Lessons learnt in measles epidemiology (such as trends in the incidence of the disease in adolescents and infants), as well as in the history of MMR recommendations, may be useful for the evaluation of future epidemiological changes with respect to varicella and herpes zoster. In view of a rapidly waning immunity against the varicella zoster virus after vaccination with one dose and the lifelong persistence of the virus, achieving a robust and sustainable immunity in the general population seems to be an ambitious goal. However, this accomplishment will be indispensable in preventing breakthrough infections and a shift of varicella to older ages and in avoiding an increase in herpes zoster incidence.","['Siedler A', 'Hecht J', 'Rieck T', 'Tolksdorf K', 'Hengel H']",2013,56,9,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"Siedler A, et al.

23986583,Genome-wide analysis of T cell responses during acute and latent simian varicella virus infections in rhesus macaques.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (HZ [shingles]). Clinical observations suggest that VZV-specific T cell immunity plays a more critical role than humoral immunity in the prevention of VZV reactivation and development of herpes zoster. Although numerous studies have characterized T cell responses directed against select VZV open reading frames (ORFs), a comprehensive analysis of the T cell response to the entire VZV genome has not yet been conducted. We have recently shown that intrabronchial inoculation of young rhesus macaques with simian varicella virus (SVV), a homolog of VZV, recapitulates the hallmarks of acute and latent VZV infection in humans. In this study, we characterized the specificity of T cell responses during acute and latent SVV infection. Animals generated a robust and broad T cell response directed against both structural and nonstructural viral proteins during acute infection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and peripheral blood. During latency, T cell responses were detected only in the BAL fluid and were lower and more restricted than those observed during acute infection. Interestingly, we identified a small set of ORFs that were immunogenic during both acute and latent infection in the BAL fluid. Given the close genome relatedness of SVV and VZV, our studies highlight immunogenic ORFs that may be further investigated as potential components of novel VZV vaccines that specifically boost T cell immunity.","['Haberthur K', 'Kraft A', 'Arnold N', 'Park B', 'Meyer C', 'Asquith M', 'Dewane J', 'Messaoudi I']",2013,87,21,J Virol,"Haberthur K, et al.

23984589,[Immunogenicity of additional varicella vaccination 3-5 years after the initial vaccination].,"Additional varicella vaccination was carried out targeting 16 subjects who had immune adherence hemagglutination (IAHA) seroconversion following the initial varicella vaccination and did not contract breakthrough varicella after the initial vaccination. The median ages at the initial and additional vaccination were 2.1 (1.1-6.9) years old and 6.1 (4.4-10.5) years old, respectively. The mean interval between the initial and additional vaccination was 4.0 (3.2-5.2) years. IAHA and glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) antibody titers were measured just before and 4-6 weeks after the additional vaccination. Side reaction was surveyed at four weeks after the additional vaccination, and compared with the results at the initial vaccination. IAHA and gpELISA seroconversion rates at the initial vaccination were 100% and 88% respectively. Prior to the additional vaccination, IAHA antibody titers significantly decreased in 50% of the subjects, and became negative in 38% of the subjects. On the other hand, a significant increase in IAHA antibody titers was observed in 25% of the subjects, and this is assumed to be the result of a subclinical infection after the initial vaccination. The positive rate of both antibodies after the additional vaccination was 100%, the mean IAHA antibody titer (Log2) after the initial/additional vaccination in seropositive subjects was 4.6/6.5, and the mean gpELISA antibody titer (Log10) was 2.3/4.0. The mean IAHA and gpELISA antibody titers were higher after the additional vaccination than after the initial vaccination (p < 0.01, p < 0.01). This is considered to be the booster effect due to the additional vaccination. At 0-2 days after the additional vaccination, a rash at the injection site was observed in 56% of the subjects, higher than the incidence after the initial vaccination (13%) (p < 0.05), but no severe systemic side reactions were observed at either the initial or the additional vaccination. In conclusion, an additional varicella vaccination 3-5 years after the initial vaccination is thought to have greater immunogenicity and is considered effective.","['Ozaki T', 'Nishimura N', 'Gotoh K', 'Funahashi K', 'Yoshii H', 'Okuno Y']",2013,87,4,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Ozaki T, et al.

23982221,Fatal varicella due to the vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus.,"We describe a death in a 15-mo-old girl who developed a varicella-like rash 20 d after varicella vaccination that lasted for 2 mo despite acyclovir treatment. The rash was confirmed to be due to vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This is the first case of fatal varicella due to vaccine-strain VZV reported from the United States. The patient developed severe respiratory complications that worsened with each new crop of varicella lesions; vaccine-strain VZV was detected in the bronchial lavage specimen. Sepsis and multi-organ failure led to death. The patient did not have a previously diagnosed primary immune deficiency, but her failure to thrive and repeated hospitalizations early in life (starting at 5 mo) for presumed infections and respiratory compromise treated with corticosteroids were suggestive of a primary or acquired immune deficiency. Providers should monitor for adverse reactions after varicella vaccination. If severe adverse events develop, acyclovir should be administered as soon as possible. The possibility of acyclovir resistance and use of foscarnet should be considered if lesions do not improve after 10 d of treatment (or if they become atypical [e.g., verrucous]). Experience with use of varicella vaccine indicates that the vaccine has an excellent safety profile and that serious adverse events are very rare and mostly described in immunocompromised patients. The benefit of vaccination in preventing severe disease and mortality outweigh the low risk of severe events occurring after vaccination.","['Leung J', 'Siegel S', 'Jones JF', 'Schulte C', 'Blog D', 'Schmid DS', 'Bialek SR', 'Marin M']",2014,10,1,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Leung J, et al.

23973325,The impact of the universal infant varicella immunization strategy on Canadian varicella-related hospitalization rates.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella vaccine was introduced to the infant immunization schedule in each province or territory between 2000 and 2007 as a result of the Canadian Immunization Strategy. The impact of vaccinating children against this disease is potentially far reaching, as immunization may also benefit those segments of the population not immunized. The objective of this paper is to examine the effects of varicella vaccine on related hospitalizations across the entire Canadian population.
METHODS: This study is an ecological study using annual hospitalization rates in all ten provinces between 1990 and 2010.
RESULTS: There were decreased varicella-related hospitalization rates for all ages across Canada following the introduction of varicella vaccination programs. The majority of changes in hospitalization rates were greater than 70% across all ages less than 40. Statistically significant declines in hospitalization were found for children aged 1-4 (ranges from 65 to 93%), and children less than 1 (ranges from 48 to 100%). Adults aged 20-39 and 40-59 also experienced statistically significant declines (55-100%, and 39-76% respectively).
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that decreased circulation of varicella appears to significantly contribute to declines in varicella-related hospitalizations for infants <1, as well as adults aged 20-39.","['Waye A', 'Jacobs P', 'Tan B']",2013,31,42,Vaccine,"Waye A, et al.

23973248,Varicella zoster virus infection occurs at a relatively young age in The Netherlands.,"INTRODUCTION: To date, there is no universal varicella vaccination in the Netherlands. We studied the seroprevalence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) specific antibodies and determinants for seropositivity among participants of a serosurveillance study, conducted in 2006/2007 among Dutch inhabitants 0-79 years of age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serological testing of 6386 blood samples for VZV was performed with a fluorescent bead-based multiplex immunoassay. Seroprevalence and geometric mean concentration (GMC) were weighted for age, sex, ethnicity, and urbanization rate to the total Dutch population. Determinants for VZV seropositivity were identified among children younger than 6 years of age using a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of VZV specific antibodies in the Dutch population was 94.6% (95% CI: 93.2-96.0%). This seroprevalence increased rapidly with age: at 6 years of age, more than 95% were seropositive. Determinants associated with lower VZV seropositivity were: young age, first-generation non-Dutch ethnicity, and low frequency of attendance at a day care center or nursery school. The GMC increased with age and was lower for women than for men from the age of 20 years onwards.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that VZV infection occurs at a younger age in the Netherlands compared to other countries, which might explain the low disease burden due to varicella. Introduction of universal varicella vaccination is not a foregone conclusion in the Netherlands. Changes in migration and day care usage will influence the age-specific risk on varicella and should therefore be monitored. Further research might elucidate the sex differences in VZV specific GMC.","['van Lier A', 'Smits G', 'Mollema L', 'Waaijenborg S', 'Berbers G', 'van der Klis F', 'Boot H', 'Wallinga J', 'de Melker H']",2013,31,44,Vaccine,"van Lier A, et al.

Although it is popular, the scientific basis for its effect on the skin has not yet been established. Here, the melanogenesis regulatory effect of argan oil was evaluated using B16 murine melanoma cells. Results of melanin assay using B16 cells treated with different concentrations of argan oil showed a dose-dependent decrease in melanin content. Western blot results showed that the expression levels of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) proteins were decreased. In addition, there was an increase in the activation of MITF and ERK1/2. Real-time PCR results revealed a downregulation of Tyr, Trp1, Dct, and Mitf mRNA expressions. Argan oil treatment causes MITF phosphorylation which subsequently inhibited the transcription of melanogenic enzymes, TYR and DCT. The inhibitory effect of argan oil on melanin biosynthesis may be attributed to tocopherols as well as the synergistic effect of its components. The results of this study provide the scientific basis for the traditionally established benefits of argan oil and present its therapeutic potential against hyperpigmentation disorders.","['Villareal MO', 'Kume S', 'Bourhim T', 'Bakhtaoui FZ', 'Kashiwagi K', 'Han J', 'Gadhi C', 'Isoda H']",2013,2013,,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,"Villareal MO, et al.

23935496,Three-dimensional normal human neural progenitor tissue-like assemblies: a model of persistent varicella-zoster virus infection.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic human alphaherpesvirus that causes varicella upon primary infection, establishes latency in multiple ganglionic neurons, and can reactivate to cause zoster. Live attenuated VZV vaccines are available; however, they can also establish latent infections and reactivate. Studies of VZV latency have been limited to the analyses of human ganglia removed at autopsy, as the virus is strictly a human pathogen. Recently, terminally differentiated human neurons have received much attention as a means to study the interaction between VZV and human neurons; however, the short life-span of these cells in culture has limited their application. Herein, we describe the construction of a model of normal human neural progenitor cells (NHNP) in tissue-like assemblies (TLAs), which can be successfully maintained for at least 180 days in three-dimensional (3D) culture, and exhibit an expression profile similar to that of human trigeminal ganglia. Infection of NHNP TLAs with cell-free VZV resulted in a persistent infection that was maintained for three months, during which the virus genome remained stable. Immediate-early, early and late VZV genes were transcribed, and low-levels of infectious VZV were recurrently detected in the culture supernatant.

23930640,Varicella vaccine uptake and associated factors in children in Hong Kong.,"Varicella is a common and highly contagious childhood disease which impacts the public worldwide. Hong Kong children can only be vaccinated against the disease in private practice. The varicella vaccination rate of local children in preschool is uncertain. Therefore a cross-sectional kindergarten-based parent-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in Hong Kong during 2012. Twelve kindergartens were randomly selected from a complete school list from the Education Bureau of Hong Kong. In total, 1285/1538 (83·6%) parents consented to join the study and completed the questionnaires. The overall varicella infection rate was 19·5% and the uptake of varicella vaccination rate was 57·6%. Barriers against varicella vaccination were mostly due to parental uncertainties about the effectiveness of vaccine, lack of recommendations from doctors or government, and adverse side-effects of the vaccine. The government and healthcare professional bodies are strongly recommended to further enhance health education among healthcare professionals, encouraging their active promotion of varicella vaccination for their patients. Furthermore, health education through various stakeholders is crucial to enhance parental awareness of varicella, as well as the effectiveness and safety of varicella vaccine.","['Chan JY', 'Leung KM', 'Tam WW', 'Lee A']",2014,142,5,Epidemiol Infect,"Chan JY, et al.

23922376,"Incidence and clinical characteristics of herpes zoster among children in the varicella vaccine era, 2005-2009.","BACKGROUND: Vaccine-strain herpes zoster (HZ) can occur after varicella vaccination. This study determined the number and proportion of HZ cases caused by vaccine-strain varicella zoster virus (VZV), assessed the positive predictive value of provider diagnosis of HZ, and computed HZ incidence rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated children.
METHODS: We used electronic medical records to identify all office visits with an HZ diagnosis for children aged <18 years in a managed care plan. Providers collected skin specimens and completed a questionnaire. Specimens were tested by polymerase chain reaction to identify wild-type or vaccine-strain VZV.
RESULTS: From May 2005 to September 2009, we enrolled 322 subjects. VZV was detected in 82% of specimens (84% wild-type, 15% vaccine-strain, 1% possible vaccine-wild-type recombinant). Among the 118 vaccinated subjects, VZV was detected in 70% (52% wild-type). The positive predictive value for provider diagnosis of ""definite HZ"" was 93% for unvaccinated and 79% for vaccinated children. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed HZ was 48 per 100,000 person-years in vaccinated children (both wild-type and vaccine-strain) and 230 per 100,000 person-years in unvaccinated children (wild-type only).
CONCLUSIONS: HZ incidence in vaccinated children was 79% lower than in unvaccinated children. Among vaccinated children, half of HZ cases were due to wild-type VZV.","['Weinmann S', 'Chun C', 'Schmid DS', 'Roberts M', 'Vandermeer M', 'Riedlinger K', 'Bialek SR', 'Marin M']",2013,208,11,J Infect Dis,"Weinmann S, et al.

23905963,Novel polyvalent live vaccine against varicella-zoster and mumps virus infections.,"The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) Oka vaccine strain (vOka) is a highly immunogenic and safe live vaccine that has long been used worldwide. Because its genome is large, making it suitable for inserting foreign genes, vOka is considered a candidate vector for novel polyvalent vaccines. Previously, a recombinant vOka, rvOka-HN, that expresses mumps virus (MuV) hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) was generated by the present team. rvOka-HN induces production of neutralizing antibodies against MuV in guinea pigs. MuV also expresses fusion (F) protein, which is important for inducing neutralizing antibodies, in its viral envelope. To induce a more robust immune response against MuV than that obtained with rvOka-HN, here an rvOka expressing both HN and F (rvOka-HN-F) was generated. However, co-expression of HN and F caused the infected cells to form syncytia, which reduced virus titers. To reduce the amount of cell fusion, an rvOka expressing HN and a mutant F, F(S195Y) were generated. Almost no syncytia formed among the rvOka-HN-F(S195Y)-infected cells and the growth of rvOka-HN-F(S195Y) was similar to that of the original vOka clone. Moreover, replacement of serine 195 with tyrosine had no effect on the immunogenicity of F in mice and guinea pigs. Although obvious augmentation of neutralizing antibody production was not observed after adding F protein to vOka-HN, the anti-F antibodies did have neutralizing activity. These data suggest that F protein contributes to induction of immune protection against MuV. Therefore this recombinant virus is a promising candidate vaccine for polyvalent protection against both VZV and MuV.","['Matsuura M', 'Somboonthum P', 'Murakami K', 'Ota M', 'Shoji M', 'Kawabata K', 'Mizuguchi H', 'Gomi Y', 'Yamanishi K', 'Mori Y']",2013,57,10,Microbiol Immunol,"Matsuura M, et al.

23896382,Quantifying the re-exposure process to an infectious agent. Measles and varicella as examples.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: For viral infections conferring what is usually considered as permanent immunity, re-exposure to the pathogen due to contacts with infectious individuals might be critical for immunity boosting. A major example is represented by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) where re-exposure is thought to lead to boosting of cell mediated immunity (CMI), which plays a protective role against the development of herpes zoster (HZ). Similar concerns have recently been raised also in relation to measles. However, while the first effective exposure, i.e. infection, has been the object of many studies, both theoretical and epidemiological, there has been no corresponding investigation of the re-exposure process.
METHODOLOGY AND DATA: By combining basic concepts from deterministic and stochastic modelling of infection, we develop a basic model for quantifying the timing and number of re-exposures and, consequently, the potential for immune boosting at any given age. The model is then applied to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) in the UK, and to varicella in Italy, using literature estimates of the pre-vaccination forces of infection.
RESULTS: We supply analytical expressions for the expected number of lifetime re-exposures and for underlying age-patterns, including the average age at which the last re-exposure occurs. Based on updated estimates of the force of VZV infection, we show that the expected number of boosting opportunities of CMI might be in the range 2-3, which is consistent with recent findings about the development of herpes zoster. We also show that the estimate of the age at which the last re-exposure to VZV occurs is highly sensitive to the underlying form of age dependence of the force of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to the study of the potential immunity boosting effect of re-exposures to an infective agent by quantifying the re-exposure process.","['Scalia Tomba G', 'Manfredi P']",2013,245,1,Math Biosci,Scalia Tomba G and Manfredi P.

23886000,Advances in the treatment of varicella-zoster virus infections.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes two distinct diseases, varicella (chickenpox) and shingles (herpes zoster). Chickenpox occurs subsequent to primary infection, while herpes zoster (usually associated with aging and immunosuppression) appears as a consequence of reactivation of latent virus. The major complication of shingles is postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccination strategies to prevent varicella or shingles and the current status of antivirals against VZV will be discussed in this chapter. Varivax®, a live-attenuated vaccine, is available for pediatric varicella. Zostavax® is used to boost VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity in adults older than 50 years, which results in a decrease in the burden of herpes zoster and pain related to postherpetic neuralgia. Regardless of the availability of a vaccine, new antiviral agents are necessary for treatment of VZV infections. Current drugs approved for therapy of VZV infections include nucleoside analogues that target the viral DNA polymerase and depend on the viral thymidine kinase for their activation. Novel anti-VZV drugs have recently been evaluated in clinical trials, including the bicyclic nucleoside analogue FV-100, the helicase-primase inhibitor ASP2151, and valomaciclovir (prodrug of the acyclic guanosine derivative H2G). Different candidate VZV drugs have been described in recent years. New anti-VZV drugs should be as safe as and more effective than current gold standards for the treatment of VZV, that is, acyclovir and its prodrug valacyclovir.","['Andrei G', 'Snoeck R']",2013,67,,Adv Pharmacol,Andrei G and Snoeck R.

23884823,Determination and clinical correlation of markers of inflammation in unvaccinated patients with varicella-zoster infection.,"BACKGROUND: Chicken pox is commonly known as a benign exenthamatous disease of childhood, occasionally neurologic or hemorrhagic complications, or even death may ensue. Early predictors of severity of disease have yet to be identified. TNF-alpha and IL-6 stimulate virus-specific immunoglobulin production and it has been postulated that determination of levels of these cytokines may be useful as a prognostic factor.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection in the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases were evaluated for eligibility. Laboratory assays included an evaluation of complete blood counts, erythrocyte-sedimentation rate (ESR), c reactive protein (CRP), and the number of tumor necrosis factor-alpha/interleukin-6-(TNF-alpha/IL-6-) producing mononuclear cells as determined by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: A total of 339 patients (320 with chickenpox and 19 with shingles) were enrolled. Blood samples could only be obtained from 81 of the 320 patients with chickenpox. Patients were also divided into three groups depending on the number of skin (vesicular) lesions. (group 1, ≤ 50 lesions; group 2, 51-100 lesions; group 3, >100 lesions). Correlation analyses did not reveal the presence of a statistically significant correlation between number of skin lesions with either of white blood cells (WBC) count (p = 0.231), ESR (p = 0.879) or CRP (p = 0.373). The mean percentage of TNF-alpha-producing mononuclear cells was significantly higher in group 2 compared to group 3 (p = 0.003). A similar difference was observed with regard to IL-6-producing mononuclear cells, albeit bordering on statistical significance (p = 0.058).
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased expression of the cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 may be responsible for the development of a more severe clinical picture in patients with VZV infection, and determination of intracellular levels of these cytokines may be of benefit for early identification of patients who may have a more severe clinical course.","['Karadag Oncel E', 'Kara A', 'Celik M', 'Karahan S', 'Cengiz AB', 'Ceyhan M']",2013,17,15,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"Karadag Oncel E, et al.

23884722,The variegate neurological manifestations of varicella zoster virus infection.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is an exclusively human neurotropic alphaherpesvirus. Primary infection causes varicella (chickenpox), after which the virus becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. With advancing age or immunosuppression, cell-mediated immunity to VZV declines, and the virus reactivates to cause zoster (shingles), dermatomal distribution, pain, and rash. Zoster is often followed by chronic pain (postherpetic neuralgia), cranial nerve palsies, zoster paresis, vasculopathy, meningoencephalitis, and multiple ocular disorders. This review covers clinical, laboratory, and pathological features of neurological complications of VZV reactivation, including diagnostic testing to verify active VZV infection in the nervous system. Additional perspectives are provided by discussions of VZV latency, animal models to study varicella pathogenesis and immunity, and of the value of vaccination of elderly individuals to boost cell-mediated immunity to VZV and prevent VZV reactivation.","['Gilden D', 'Nagel MA', 'Cohrs RJ', 'Mahalingam R']",2013,13,9,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,"Gilden D, et al.

23871823,Validity of a reported history of chickenpox in targeting varicella vaccination at susceptible adolescents in England.,"INTRODUCTION: In the UK, primary varicella is usually a mild infection in children, but can cause serious illness in susceptible pregnant women and adults. The UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is considering an adolescent varicella vaccination programme. Cost-effectiveness depends upon identifying susceptibles and minimising vaccine wastage, and chickenpox history is one method to screen for eligibility. To inform this approach, we estimated the proportion of adolescents with varicella antibodies by reported chickenpox history.
METHODS: Recruitment occurred through secondary schools in England from February to September 2012. Parents were asked about their child's history of chickenpox, explicitly setting the context in terms of the implications for vaccination. 247 adolescents, whose parents reported positive (120), negative (77) or uncertain (50) chickenpox history provided oral fluid for varicella zoster virus-specific immunoglobulin-G (VZV-IgG) testing.
RESULTS: 109 (90.8% [85.6-96.0%]) adolescents with a positive chickenpox history, 52 (67.5% [57.0-78.1%]) with a negative history and 42 (84.0% [73.7-94.3%]) with an uncertain history had VZV-IgG suggesting prior infection. Combining negative and uncertain histories, 74% had VZV-IgG (best-case). When discounting low total-IgG samples and counting equivocals as positive (worst-case), 84% had VZV-IgG. We also modelled outcomes by varying the negative predictive value (NPV) for the antibody assay, and found 74-87% under the best-case and 84-92% under the worst-case scenario would receive vaccine unnecessarily as NPV falls to 50%.
CONCLUSION: Reported chickenpox history discriminates between varicella immunity and susceptibility in adolescents, but significant vaccine wastage would occur if this approach alone were used to determine vaccine eligibility. A small but important proportion of those with positive chickenpox history would remain susceptible. These data are needed to determine whether reported history, with or without oral fluid testing in those with negative and uncertain history, is sufficiently discriminatory to underpin a cost-effective adolescent varicella vaccination programme.","['Field N', 'Amirthalingam G', 'Waight P', 'Andrews N', 'Ladhani SN', 'van Hoek AJ', 'Maple PA', 'Brown KE', 'Miller E']",2014,32,10,Vaccine,"Field N, et al.

23860619,Putative factors associated with molar incisor hypomineralisation: an epidemiological study.,"AIM: The aim of the study was to examine the aetiological factors involved in the development of molar incisor hypomineralisation (MIH).
METHODS: The study population comprised 4,049 children (2,029 girls, 2020 boys) aged 7-12 years. Children were examined for MIH in the school environment. Putative aetiological factors were evaluated using a questionnaire sent to children's families. The questionnaire included questions on prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal systemic conditions. Multivariate analysis was performed using multiple logistic regression, and Pearson's Chi-square test was used to evaluate nominal or ordinal variables with Fisher's exact test used in cases of small sample sizes. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: MIH was observed in 7.7 % of the study population. A total of 3,827 completed questionnaires were returned, yielding a response rate of 95.3 %. MIH was found to be associated with prematurity (7 %), gastrointestinal problems (3.9 %), pneumonia (6.3 %), frequent fever (26.1 %), measles (14.7 %), and chickenpox (29.3 %) before age 4 years.
STATISTICS: Prevalence did not vary significantly between girls and boys (p > 0.05). Prematurity, gastrointestinal problems, pneumonia, frequent high fever, measles, and chickenpox before age 4 years were found to be significantly related with MIH (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The aetiology of MIH is not clear yet, and the results of this study support the results of previous studies regarding the putative causal effect of several factors.","['Sönmez H', 'Yıldırım G', 'Bezgin T']",2013,14,6,Eur Arch Paediatr Dent,"Sönmez H, et al.

23858422,Clonal cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis in children may be cured by cyclosporine A.,"Cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis (CHP) is a rare panniculitis in childhood, associated either with nonmalignant conditions or with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL), and often also associated with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Discriminating between these 2 conditions is therapeutically important because nonmalignant CHP often improves under cyclosporine and prednisone, whereas most cases of SPLT may be best treated with more aggressive therapy. We report the cases of a 6-month-old boy and a 16-month-old girl who, after viral infection, developed multiple infiltrating skin nodules on the limbs and face, associated with MAS. Histopathologic findings for skin biopsy specimens revealed CHP associated with heavily cellular lobular panniculitis. Hemophagocytosis and immunohistochemical staining features were consistent with typical characteristics of in situ MAS in adipose tissue: the lymphocytes were mostly TCD8+ cells with an activated phenotype (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR+) and expressed interferon-γ; CD68+ macrophages expressed tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. A monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor γ gene was present in skin tissue but not in peripheral blood or bone marrow lymphocytes. Cyclosporine A treatment resulted in the complete remission of cutaneous and systemic manifestations in both patients for 66 and 29 months, respectively. This report suggests that the diagnosis of a reactive T-cell lymphoproliferation should be the treatment of choice in young children with severe CHP, even if there is a SPTCL-like aspect with an in situ T-cell clonality. It also suggests that CSA is the optimal treatment of this condition and postulates the possible pathologic process underlying this efficacy.","['Bader-Meunier B', 'Fraitag S', 'Janssen C', 'Brochard K', 'Lamant L', 'Wouters C', 'Bodemer C']",2013,132,2,Pediatrics,"Bader-Meunier B, et al.

This study was performed to report a case of breakthrough chickenpox outbreak among a group of people in the healthcare center and also evaluate the seroprevalence of patients who have been managed with chronic neurological diseases in this center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included patients diagnosed with varicella in April 2009 as an index cases and investigated the past history for chickenpox and the varicella-specific IgG. Sixty-two patients (children) and 156 healthcare workers who may have had possible contact with the index cases were also investigated for.
RESULTS: We investigated the seroprevalence of 62 patients not affected by the outbreak. The varicella vaccination rate in children was 90.3%. Sixty-one point three percent of all patients were seropositive and 63.6% of these patients were aged between 12 and 23 months and 87.5% were aged between 24 and 35 months. Seropositive rate was decreased for patients aged between 36 and 59 months while the seropositive prevalence has increased for patients over 5 years old. Over 90% of the adults investigated were seropositive. IgG seronegative despite vaccination was 32.1% (18 persons).
CONCLUSION: Breakthrough varicella outbreak can have huge impact in healthcare centers with affiliated group housing. We need to investigate vaccination status and immunogenicity according to ages and reflect appropriately on vaccination policy taking into consideration of social and medical requirements in the local area.","['Park CS', 'Kim DS', 'Kim KH']",2013,2,2,Clin Exp Vaccine Res,"Park CS, et al.

If latent infection is established in trigeminal ganglion, the reactivation can determine viral migration to cerebral arteries, which causes a cerebral vasculopathy and subsequently an ischemic stroke.
PATIENTS: Here we report on a child experiencing recurrent episodes of headache mimicking a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, in the absence of any skin rash, which were followed by the occurrence of an ipsilateral hemiparesis associated with a choreic movement disorder a month later.
RESULTS: Magnetic resonance angiography showed evidence of a right-sided infarction of basal ganglia and anterior limb of the internal capsule, corresponding to the vascular territory of the recurrent artery of Heubner, as a consequence of a focal varicella zoster virus arteriopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the recognition of this prodromal manifestation, which can be interpreted as a zoster sine herpete, could provide clinicians an extremely useful time window to start promptly with a prophylactic treatment.","['Spagnoli C', 'Cantalupo G', 'Piccolo B', 'Cerasti D', 'Pisani F']",2013,49,3,Pediatr Neurol,"Spagnoli C, et al.

23838069,[Current management of post-varicella stroke in children: a literature review].,"Among infectious factors, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a leading cause of central nervous system vasculopathy and stroke in childhood. Not only have viral markers been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of affected patients, but also direct evidence of viral particles in the wall of cerebral arteries has been demonstrated in rare pathological specimens. This certainly reflects a localized infectious process likely associated with variable indirect inflammatory responses. Yet the usefulness in this setting of a lumbar puncture as well as of subsequent targeted antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory therapies is uncertain. Indeed, in the majority of cases, the so-called post-varicella angiopathy has a monophasic evolution with spontaneous resolution or stabilization, explaining diverging diagnostic and treatment approaches. In this paper, we have addressed this problematic area by reviewing 26 published cases from the year 2000 and three unpublished cases. Post-varicella stroke is typically associated with angiopathy most often involving the initial portion of the middle cerebral artery, causing a basal ganglia stroke.

23835965,Respiratory complications in children hospitalized with varicella.,"The aim of the study was to retrospectively determine the incidence and clinical course of varicella-related respiratory complications in children during the 6-year period 2005-2010. We attempted to identify the predisposing factors and outcome of such complications. Clinical records of 237 children treated in an academic hospital of the Medical University in Wroclaw, Poland were reviewed, taking into consideration the reason for referral to the hospital, duration of hospitalization, and diagnosis. There were 28 (11.8 %) children (mean age 2.8 ± 2.8 years) in the cohort hospitalized with varicella-related respiratory complications. The infants younger than 1 year predominated (9/28). None of the children were previously immunized against varicella. Admission occurred 5.0 ± 2.8 days after the first symptoms of varicella. The source of infection was an older sibling in 13/28 cases. The mean duration of hospitalization was 5.4 ± 2.0 days. The main symptoms were fever (20/28), cough (26/28), tachypnea (11/28), and dyspnea (7/28). Chest X-ray was performed in eight children, confirming pneumonia in six cases. Based on blood gases, chest X-ray, and clinical symptoms, pneumonia was diagnosed in 15/28 and acute bronchitis in 8/28 children. Intravenous antiviral therapy with acyclovir was administered in 16/28 and antibiotics in 14/28 children. In two cases, oxygen therapy was required and one child presented respiratory failure treated in the Intensive Care Unit. We conclude that respiratory tract involvement in the course of varicella infection in children is relatively common. Age less than 1 and an infected older sibling seem major risk factors for respiratory complications.","['Kuchar E', 'Miskiewicz K', 'Szenborn L', 'Nitsch-Osuch A']",2013,788,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Kuchar E, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Research was conducted using PubMed, Scopus and ISI databases. Score quality and data extraction were performed for all included studies.
RESULTS: Twenty-three articles met the criteria: 15 cost-effectiveness, 8 cost-benefit and one cost-utility analysis. Varicella vaccination could save the society from €637,762 (infant strategy) to 53 million annually (combined infant and adolescent strategy). The median and the mean quality scores resulted in 91.8% and 85.4% respectively; 11 studies were considered of high quality and 12 of low quality.
DISCUSSION: The studies are favorable to the introduction of universal varicella vaccination in Italy, being cost saving and having a positive impact on morbidity. The quality score of the studies varied greatly: recent analyses were of comparable quality to older studies.","['Unim B', 'Saulle R', 'Boccalini S', 'Taddei C', 'Ceccherini V', 'Boccia A', 'Bonanni P', 'La Torre G']",2013,9,9,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Unim B, et al.

23820238,Cycling probe technology to quantify and discriminate between wild-type varicella-zoster virus and Oka vaccine strains.,"Rapid differentiation between wild-type varicella zoster virus (VZV) and Oka-vaccine (vOka) strains is important for monitoring side reactions of varicella vaccination. To develop a high-throughput molecular diagnostic method for the differentiation of wild-type VZV and vOka strains based on cycling probe technology. The primers were designed to amplify common sequences spanning a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in gene 62 of VZV. DNA-RNA chimeric probes (cycling probes) were designed to detect the SNP at nucleotide 105705. The cycling probe real-time PCR assays for VZV wild-type and vOka strains specifically amplified plasmids containing target sequences that ranged between 10 and 1×10(6) copies per reaction. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were less than 5%. After initial validation studies, the clinical reliability of this method was evaluated using 38 swab samples that were collected from patients suspected of being zoster. Compared to the loop mediated isothermal amplification method, which is defined as the gold standard, cycling probe real-time PCR was highly sensitive and specific. The cycling probe real-time PCR technology is a reliable tool for differentiating between wild-type VZV and vOka strains in clinical samples.","['Ihira M', 'Higashimoto Y', 'Kawamura Y', 'Sugata K', 'Ohashi M', 'Asano Y', 'Yoshikawa T']",2013,193,2,J Virol Methods,"Ihira M, et al.

23815523,"Varicella routine vaccination and the effects on varicella epidemiology - results from the Bavarian Varicella Surveillance Project (BaVariPro), 2006-2011.","BACKGROUND: In 2004, routine varicella vaccination was recommended in Germany for children 11-14 months of age with one dose, and since 2009, with a second dose at 15-23 months of age. The effects on varicella epidemiology were investigated.
METHODS: Data on varicella vaccinations, cases and complications were collected from annual parent surveys (2006-2011), monthly paediatric practice surveillance (Oct 2006 - Sep 2011; five varicella seasons) and paediatric hospital databases (2005-2009) in the area of Munich (about 238,000 paediatric inhabitants); annual incidences of cases and hospitalisations were estimated.
RESULTS: Varicella vaccination coverage (1st dose) in children 18-36 months of age increased in two steps (38%, 51%, 53%, 53%, 66% and 68%); second-dose coverage reached 59% in the 2011 survey. A monthly mean of 82 (62%) practices participated; they applied a total of 50,059 first-dose and 40,541 second-dose varicella vaccinations, with preferential use of combined MMR-varicella vaccine after recommendation of two doses, and reported a total of 16,054 varicella cases <17 years of age. The mean number of cases decreased by 67% in two steps, from 6.6 (95%CI 6.1-7.0) per 1,000 patient contacts in season 2006/07 to 4.2 (95%CI 3.9-4.6) in 2007/08 and 4.0 (95%CI 3.6-4.3) in 2008/09, and further to 2.3 (95%CI 2.0-2.6) in 2009/10 and 2.2 (95%CI 1.9-2.5) in 2010/11. The decrease occurred in all paediatric age groups, indicating herd protection effects. Incidence of varicella was estimated as 78/1,000 children <17 years of age in 2006/07, and 19/1,000 in 2010/11. Vaccinated cases increased from 0.3 (95%0.2-0.3) per 1,000 patient contacts in 2006/07 to 0.4 (95%CI 0.3-0.5) until 2008/09 and decreased to 0.2 (95%CI 0.2-0.3) until 2010/11. The practices treated a total of 134 complicated cases, mainly with skin complications. The paediatric hospitals recorded a total of 178 varicella patients, including 40 (22.5%) with neurological complications and one (0.6%) fatality due to varicella pneumonia. Incidence of hospitalisations decreased from 7.6 per 100,000 children <17 years of age in 2005 to 4.3 in 2009, and from 21.0 to 4.7 in children <5 years of age.

BACKGROUND: The correct diagnosis and treatment of oral manifestations during early childhood is important for children's development. The pediatric dentist is responsible for maintaining oral health in children, since they change constantly during their development and growth.
CASE REPORT: Four cases of oral lesions are described, in which the diagnosis and related approach for each one is reported. The first was an acute primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, the second, pseudomembranous candidiasis, the third, chickenpox and the last was molluscum.
CONCLUSION: Professionals who treat children in this age group must be able to diagnose and treat common oral manifestations when necessary and should refer the child to a pediatrician for effective treatment if the presence of any systemic alteration is suspected.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pathognomonic signs of the most common oral manifestations in early childhood should be known by dentists to improve early diagnosis and proper management.","['Padovani MC', 'Barbosa PS', 'Baeder F', ""de Sant'Anna GR"", 'Santos MT', 'Guaré RO']",2013,14,2,J Contemp Dent Pract,"Padovani MC, et al.

METHODS: All reported cases of varicella infection from 1994 to 2011 were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 19,577 patients with varicella were reported during the study period, and 8869 were female and 10,248 were male, with a male to female ratio of 1.15:1. Most of the cases were reported in patients between one to four year of age (n = 5625; 29.4%) and five to nine years of age (n = 6614; 34.6%) years of age. The highest numbers of cases were reported in March-May corresponding to the spring time (39.3%) compared with 21.2% in the winter and 25.4% in the summer time. The childhood varicella vaccine was introduced in 1998 and was made mandatory in 2008. The total number of cases decreased from 10,070 in the pre-vaccination period to 1577 cases in the mandatory vaccination period. The incidence rate decreased from 739.8 in 1994 to 355.3 in 1998, to 88.1 in 2011 per 100,000 population (P < 0.0001). Patients less than one year of age constituted 8.3% of cases in 1994-1997 prior to vaccination, 5.4% in 1998-2008 during the initial vaccination phase and 3.4% during the mandatory vaccination period (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The introduction of varicella vaccine resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence rates between 1994 and 2011.","['Al-Tawfiq JA', 'AbuKhamsin A', 'Memish ZA']",2013,11,5,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Al-Tawfiq JA, et al.

23807363,Validity of medical record documented varicella-zoster virus among unvaccinated cohorts.,"BACKGROUND: A varicella diagnosis or verification of disease history by any healthcare provider is currently accepted for determining evidence of immunity by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).
OBJECTIVE: To examine the accuracy of medical record (MR) documented varicella history as a measure of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunity among unvaccinated individuals born after 1980. We also assessed methods to practically implement ACIP guidelines to verify varicella history using medical records.
STUDY DESIGN: As part of a larger cross-sectional study conducted at three Philadelphia clinics from 2004-2006, we recruited 536 unvaccinated patients aged 5-19 y (birth years: 1985-2001). Varicella history was obtained from three sources: parent/patient interview, any MR documentation (sick and well visits) and MR documentation of a sick visit for varicella. All participants were tested for VZV IgG. For each source and three age groups (5-9, 10-14, 15-19 y old), positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated. Specificity of varicella history was compared between different sources using McNemar's Chi-square.
RESULTS: Among participants aged 5-9, 10-14 and 15-19 y the PPV for any MR documentation and sick visit diagnosis were 96% and 100%, 92% and 97%, and 99% and 100%, respectively. The specificity for sick visit documentation was higher than any MR documentation and patient/parent recall among all age groups; however, these differences were only statistically significant when comparing sick visit documentation to parent/patient recall for 10-14 y olds.
CONCLUSION: Sick visit documentation of varicella in the MR is an accurate predictor of varicella seropositivity and useful for confirming disease history among unvaccinated persons (birth years: 1985-2001). This method is a practical way to verify varicella history using the ACIP guidelines.","['Mohanty S', 'Perella D', 'Jumaan A', 'Robinson D', 'Forke CM', 'Schmid DS', 'Renwick M', 'Mankodi F', 'Watson B', 'Fiks AG']",2013,9,8,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Mohanty S, et al.

23805224,Herpes Zoster Risk Reduction through Exposure to Chickenpox Patients: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and may subsequently reactivate to cause herpes zoster later in life. The exogenous boosting hypothesis states that re-exposure to circulating VZV can inhibit VZV reactivation and consequently also herpes zoster in VZV-immune individuals. Using this hypothesis, mathematical models predicted widespread chickenpox vaccination to increase herpes zoster incidence over more than 30 years. Some countries have postponed universal chickenpox vaccination, at least partially based on this prediction. After a systematic search and selection procedure, we analyzed different types of exogenous boosting studies. We graded 13 observational studies on herpes zoster incidence after widespread chickenpox vaccination, 4 longitudinal studies on VZV immunity after re-exposure, 9 epidemiological risk factor studies, 7 mathematical modeling studies as well as 7 other studies. We conclude that exogenous boosting exists, although not for all persons, nor in all situations. Its magnitude is yet to be determined adequately in any study field.","['Ogunjimi B', 'Van Damme P', 'Beutels P']",2013,8,6,PLoS One,"Ogunjimi B, et al.

23794213,Complications of varicella zoster virus reactivation.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is an exclusively human neurotropic alphaherpesvirus. Primary infection causes varicella (chickenpox), after which virus becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. With advancing age or immunosuppression, cell-mediated immunity to VZV declines and virus reactivates to cause zoster (shingles), which can occur anywhere on the body. Skin lesions resolve within 1-2 weeks, while complete cessation of pain usually takes 4-6 weeks. Zoster can be followed by chronic pain (postherpetic neuralgia), cranial nerve palsies, zoster paresis, meningoencephalitis, cerebellitis, myelopathy, multiple ocular disorders and vasculopathy that can mimic giant cell arteritis. All of the neurological and ocular disorders listed above may also develop without rash. Diagnosis of VZV-induced neurological disease may require examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and/ or ocular fluids. In the absence of rash in a patient with neurological disease potentially due to VZV, CSF should be examined for VZV DNA by PCR and for anti-VZV IgG and IgM. Detection of VZV IgG antibody in CSF is superior to detection of VZV DNA in CSF to diagnose vasculopathy, recurrent myelopathy, and brainstem encephalitis. Oral antiviral drugs speed healing of rash and shorten acute pain. Immunocompromised patients require intravenous acyclovir. First-line treatments for post-herpetic neuralgia include tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, and topical lidocaine patches. VZV vasculopathy, meningoencephalitis, and myelitis are all treated with intravenous acyclovir.","['Nagel MA', 'Gilden D']",2013,15,4,Curr Treat Options Neurol,Nagel MA and Gilden D.

23792686,Visualization and quantitation of abundant macroautophagy in virus-infected cells by confocal three-dimensional fluorescence imaging.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpesvirus. Primary infection causes varicella (chickenpox), a viremic illness typified by an exanthem consisting of several hundred vesicles. When VZV reactivates from latency in the spinal ganglia during late adulthood, the emerging virus causes a vesicular dermatomal rash (herpes zoster or shingles). To expand investigations of autophagy during varicella and zoster, newer 3D imaging technology was combined with laser scanning confocal microscopy to provide animations of autophagosomes in the vesicular rash. First, the cells were immunolabeled with antibodies against VZV proteins and the LC3 protein, an integral autophagosomal protein. Antibody reagents lacking activity against the human blood group A1 antigen were selected. After laser excitation of the samples, optimized emission detection bandwidths were configured by Zeiss Zen control software. Confocal Z-stacks comprising up to 40 optical slices were reconstructed into 3D animations with the aid of Imaris software. With this imaging technology, individual autophagosomes were clearly detectable as spheres within each vesicular cell. To enumerate the number of autophagosomes, data sets from 50 cells were reconstructed as 3D fluorescence images and analyzed with MeasurementPro software. The mean number of autophagosomes per infected vesicular cell was >100, although over 200 autophagosomes were seen in a few cells. In summary, macroautophagy was easily quantitated within VZV-infected cells after immunolabeling and imaging by 3D confocal animation technology. These same 3D imaging techniques will be applicable for investigations of autophagy in other virus-infected cells.","['Jackson W', 'Yamada M', 'Moninger T', 'Grose C']",2013,193,1,J Virol Methods,"Jackson W, et al.

23781900,Paediatric active enhanced disease surveillance: a new surveillance system for Australia.,"AIM: The Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) is described. PAEDS is active in four tertiary children's hospitals in four states of Australia and aims to address gaps in surveillance for severe vaccine-preventable diseases and adverse events following immunisation.
METHODS: From August 2007 to December 2010, surveillance nurses actively identified and recruited children admitted with: acute flaccid paralysis, varicella infection, intussusception, seizures in infants and pandemic influenza (June-October 2009). Details of presentation, medical and immunisation history, outcome and laboratory results were collected. Completeness of ascertainment was estimated through audits of International Classification of Diseases 10th edition-coded medical records where possible.
RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-three cases matching case definition criteria for the four conditions were recruited. In addition, 601 cases of influenza were recruited during the 2009 pandemic. PAEDS enhanced acute flaccid paralysis surveillance by the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit; the World Health Organization surveillance target was met when Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit and PAEDS cases were combined. Among 133 children hospitalised for varicella, only 16 were vaccinated; samples of vesicle scrapings were collected in 57% for genotyping. Of 122 infants presenting with seizures, only six (12%) had received a vaccine in the last 7 days. Intussusception was more frequent among infants receiving their first dose of either of the rotavirus vaccines. Results informed policy and education for parents and health professionals. Preliminary audits of medical records suggest excellent ascertainment through PAEDS.
CONCLUSIONS: PAEDS provides important, previously unavailable data to inform public health policy, clinical practice and community confidence. It has potential to respond quickly during outbreaks and epidemics.","['Zurynski Y', 'McIntyre P', 'Booy R', 'Elliott EJ', 'PAEDS Investigators Group']",2013,49,7,J Paediatr Child Health,"Zurynski Y, et al.

In vitro studies using cell-associated VZV infection have demonstrated productive VZV-infection, while a few recent studies of human neurons derived from stem cells incubated with cell-free, vaccine-derived VZV did not result in generation of infectious virus. In the present study, 90%-pure human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons were incubated with recombinant cell-free pOka-derived virus made with an improved method or VZV vaccine. We found that cell-free pOka and vOka at higher multiplicities of infection elicited productive infection in neurons followed by spread of infection, cytopathic effect and release of infectious virus into the medium. These results further validate the use of this unlimited source of human neurons for studying unexplored aspects of VZV interaction with neurons such as entry, latency and reactivation.","['Sloutskin A', 'Kinchington PR', 'Goldstein RS']",2013,443,2,Virology,"Sloutskin A, et al.

However, there is limited data on the test performance of these reagents used in multiplexed PCR assays.
OBJECTIVE: This study compared the performance of two multiplexed ASR sets for detection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV in dermal specimens.
STUDY DESIGN: Two commercially available ASRs were combined to produce multiplexed PCR assays for simultaneous detection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV. Seeded samples were used to determine the limit of detection (LOD) for each assay. Patient samples (n=156) were tested in duplicate and results for each method compared to the reference standard of culture. Both extracted and unextracted specimens were used in the study.
RESULTS: Both multiplexed PCR assays showed similar test performance, with minimal LOD differences observed. The LOD was 10(3) copies/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2 using the Focus assay compared to 5×10(3) copies/mL and 2×10(4) copies/mL, respectively for the EraGen assay. Both assays showed equal performance for VZV with a LOD of 5×10(3) copies/mL. Analytical specificity testing showed no cross reactivity with other selected DNA viruses. Both assays showed similar performance when clinical samples were tested using both extracted and unextracted specimens.
CONCLUSION: Commercially available ASRs can be successfully multiplexed for the PCR detection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV using dermal specimens. Either direct testing or nucleic acid extracted specimens can be used with similar performance in these assays.","['Buelow DR', 'Bankowski MJ', 'Fofana D', 'Gu Z', 'Pounds S', 'Hayden RT']",2013,58,1,J Clin Virol,"Buelow DR, et al.

The number of patients with measles was found to be significantly decreased with the single-dose vaccination provided at public expense. However, we also witnessed an increasing trend of infection at a later age. The vaccination rates for varicella and mumps were relatively low because of their optional availability in Japan, and thus they cannot be considered to confer public protection.

The second patient was a 68-year-old woman who while bedridden developed an itchy papulovesicular rash on her back. Vesiculobullous forms of dermatitis were clinically suspected in both cases, and herpetic vesicles were the lead diagnosis in one case. Pathologically, lesions from both patients revealed intraepidermal fluid-filled vesicles that at scanning magnification raised the suspicion of herpetic lesions. At higher magnification, acantholytic cells, some seemingly multinucleated, could be ppreciated. However, immunohistochemistry for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus antigens proved negative. Moreover, some of the lesional cells revealed dyskeratosis more typical of the spongiotic/vesicular variant of Grover disease, and accordingly, this diagnosis was eventually established in both patients. Recognition of the pseudoherpetic variant of spongiotic/vesicular Grover disease is important in determining correct treatment, and therefore, subtle clues to its diagnosis should be sought in evaluation of such lesions.","['Wiersma GL', 'Saavedra AP', 'Yang FC', 'Nandi TR', 'Levine D', 'Murphy GF']",2014,36,9,Am J Dermatopathol,"Wiersma GL, et al.

23675304,T-Cell tropism of simian varicella virus during primary infection.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella, establishes a life-long latent infection of ganglia and reactivates to cause herpes zoster. The cell types that transport VZV from the respiratory tract to skin and ganglia during primary infection are unknown. Clinical, pathological, virological and immunological features of simian varicella virus (SVV) infection of non-human primates parallel those of primary VZV infection in humans. To identify the host cell types involved in virus dissemination and pathology, we infected African green monkeys intratracheally with recombinant SVV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (SVV-EGFP) and with wild-type SVV (SVV-wt) as a control. The SVV-infected cell types and virus kinetics were determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, and virus culture and SVV-specific real-time PCR, respectively. All monkeys developed fever and skin rash. Except for pneumonitis, pathology produced by SVV-EGFP was less compared to SVV-wt. In lungs, SVV infected alveolar myeloid cells and T-cells. During viremia the virus preferentially infected memory T-cells, initially central memory T-cells and subsequently effector memory T-cells. In early non-vesicular stages of varicella, SVV was seen mainly in perivascular skin infiltrates composed of macrophages, dendritic cells, dendrocytes and memory T-cells, implicating hematogenous spread. In ganglia, SVV was found primarily in neurons and occasionally in memory T-cells adjacent to neurons. In conclusion, the data suggest the role of memory T-cells in disseminating SVV to its target organs during primary infection of its natural and immunocompetent host.","['Ouwendijk WJ', 'Mahalingam R', 'de Swart RL', 'Haagmans BL', 'van Amerongen G', 'Getu S', 'Gilden D', 'Osterhaus AD', 'Verjans GM']",2013,9,5,PLoS Pathog,"Ouwendijk WJ, et al.

Because of this, protection by maternal antibodies in infants born to vaccinated mothers might be negatively affected.
METHODS:  A large cross-sectional serologic survey was conducted in the Netherlands during 2006-2007. We compared the kinetics of antibody concentrations in children and women of childbearing age in the highly vaccinated general population with those in orthodox Protestant communities that were exposed to outbreaks.
RESULTS:  The estimated duration of protection by maternal antibodies among infants in the general population, most of whom were born to vaccinated mothers, was short: 3.3 months for measles, 2.7 months for mumps, 3.9 months for rubella, and 3.4 months for varicella. The duration of protection against measles was 2 months longer for infants born in the orthodox communities, most of whom had unvaccinated mothers. For rubella, mothers in the orthodox communities had higher concentrations of antibodies as compared to the general population.
CONCLUSION:  Children of mothers vaccinated against measles and, possibly, rubella have lower concentrations of maternal antibodies and lose protection by maternal antibodies at an earlier age than children of mothers in communities that oppose vaccination. This increases the risk of disease transmission in highly vaccinated populations.","['Waaijenborg S', 'Hahné SJ', 'Mollema L', 'Smits GP', 'Berbers GA', 'van der Klis FR', 'de Melker HE', 'Wallinga J']",2013,208,1,J Infect Dis,"Waaijenborg S, et al.

However, several studies showed low rates of vaccinations in IBD patients. Furthermore, vaccination rate among IBD patients in Korea has never been investigated. We investigated the vaccination rate among IBD patients in Korea and evaluated some factors that might affect the vaccination rate.
METHODS: From November 2011 to February 2012, a total of 192 patients with IBD who visited Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) answered the IRB-approved questionnaire. The questionnaire included their sex, age, residence, past medical history, type of IBD, duration of illness, medications, history of vaccination about measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, tetanus-diphtheria (Td), influenza, hepatitis A and B, pneumococcus and human papilloma virus (HPV).
RESULTS: One hundred twenty one (63.0%) male and 71 (37.0%) female answered the questionnaire. The mean age of the enrolled patients was 39.7 (18-76) years. Eighty four patients (43.8%) had ulcerative colitis and 108 patients (56.3%) had Crohn's disease (CD). The percentage of the patients who had got vaccination was 42.2% for MMR, 34.9% for varicella, 15.6% for Td, 37.5% for influenza, 15.6% for hepatitis A, 52.6% for hepatitis B, 6.3% for pneumococcus and 11.3% for HPV respectively. Not knowing the necessity or the existence were the common reasons for non-vaccination. Age less than 40 years, CD patients and duration of illness less than 10 years were associated with a higher vaccination rate (p=0.002, 0.015 and 0.020, respectively).

23613740,Perspectives on the impact of varicella immunization on herpes zoster. A model-based evaluation from three European countries.,"The introduction of mass vaccination against Varicella-Zoster-Virus (VZV) is being delayed in many European countries because of, among other factors, the possibility of a large increase in Herpes Zoster (HZ) incidence in the first decades after the initiation of vaccination, due to the expected decline of the boosting of Cell Mediated Immunity caused by the reduced varicella circulation. A multi-country model of VZV transmission and reactivation, is used to evaluate the possible impact of varicella vaccination on HZ epidemiology in Italy, Finland and the UK. Despite the large uncertainty surrounding HZ and vaccine-related parameters, surprisingly robust medium-term predictions are provided, indicating that an increase in HZ incidence is likely to occur in countries where the incidence rate is lower in absence of immunization, possibly due to a higher force of boosting (e.g. Finland), whereas increases in HZ incidence might be minor where the force of boosting is milder (e.g. the UK). Moreover, a convergence of HZ post vaccination incidence levels in the examined countries is predicted despite different initial degrees of success of immunization policies. Unlike previous model-based evaluations, our investigation shows that after varicella immunization an increase of HZ incidence is not a certain fact, rather depends on the presence or absence of factors promoting a strong boosting intensity and which might or not be heavily affected by changes in varicella circulation due to mass immunization. These findings might explain the opposed empirical evidences observed about the increases of HZ in sites where mass varicella vaccination is ongoing.","['Poletti P', 'Melegaro A', 'Ajelli M', 'Del Fava E', 'Guzzetta G', 'Faustini L', 'Scalia Tomba G', 'Lopalco P', 'Rizzo C', 'Merler S', 'Manfredi P']",2013,8,4,PLoS One,"Poletti P, et al.

23611202,Determining the cutoff based on a continuous variable to define two populations with application to vaccines.,"In clinical research, it is sometimes desirable to dichotomize a continuous variable so that the information expressed using a dichotomous variable is more straightforward for clinicians to interpret and communicate with patients. The distribution of the continuous variable can differ between two populations defined by a disease case status. Under such a scenario, the dichotomization process can be based on distributions of the continuous variable in two distinct populations. The resulting dichotomous variable can be used as an endpoint in future studies. Even though dichotomization has not been extensively studied, dichotomization has been commonly carried out in clinical trials. We developed a methodology for determining the optimal cutoff point based on maximizing the correlation between the two populations and the dichotomous variable. In some real-world scenarios where outcome status in samples from two populations is not completely identified, we recommend using EM method to first estimate the parameters associated with the two populations before applying the proposed method to find the optimal cutoff point. In addition, we have investigated the performance of the proposed method for several common distributions (e.g., normal, log-normal and exponential distribution) of the continuous variable. Finally, we applied the proposed methods to a varicella vaccine example.","['Li S', 'Parnes M', 'Chan IS']",2013,23,3,J Biopharm Stat,"Li S, et al.

23602536,Teenagers' understandings of and attitudes towards vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: To examine immunisation information needs of teenagers we explored understandings of vaccination and vaccine-preventable diseases, attitudes towards immunisation and experiences of immunisation. Diseases discussed included nine for which vaccines are currently offered in the UK (human papillomavirus, meningitis, tetanus, diphtheria, polio, whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella), and two not currently included in the routine UK schedule (hepatitis B and chickenpox).
METHODS: Twelve focus groups conducted between November 2010 and March 2011 with 59 teenagers (29 girls and 30 boys) living in various parts of Scotland.
RESULTS: Teenagers exhibited limited knowledge and experience of the diseases, excluding chickenpox. Measles, mumps and rubella were perceived as severe forms of chickenpox-like illness, and rubella was not associated with foetal damage. Boys commonly believed that human papillomavirus only affects girls, and both genders exhibited confusion about its relationship with cancer. Participants considered two key factors when assessing the threat of diseases: their prevalence in the UK, and their potential to cause fatal or long-term harm. Meningitis was seen as a threat, but primarily to babies. Participants explained their limited knowledge as a result of mass immunisation making once-common diseases rare in the UK, and acknowledged immunisation's role in reducing disease prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: While it is welcome that fewer teenagers have experienced vaccine-preventable diseases, this presents public health advocates with the challenge of communicating benefits of immunisation when advantages are less visible. The findings are timely in view of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's recommendation that a booster of meningitis C vaccine should be offered to teenagers; that teenagers did not perceive meningitis C as a significant threat should be a key concern of promotional information. While teenagers' experiences of immunisation in school were not always positive, they seemed enthusiastic at the prospect of introducing more vaccines for their age group.","['Hilton S', 'Patterson C', 'Smith E', 'Bedford H', 'Hunt K']",2013,31,22,Vaccine,"Hilton S, et al.

23601754,Implementing guidelines on the prevention of opportunistic infections in inflammatory bowel disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Opportunistic infections are a key safety concern in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the existence of international guidelines, many gastroenterologists have not adopted routine screening and vaccination. The aim of this study was to modify clinical behaviour by use of a simple screening tool.
METHODS: A screening and vaccination proforma for hepatitis B, varicella, Influenza, Pneumococcus, human papillomavirus, tuberculosis, hepatitis C and HIV was provided to each participating gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologists were surveyed for awareness of vaccine recommendations and current practice prior to and following the introduction of the proforma. Rates of immunity and the proportion of patients receiving the recommended screening and vaccinations were documented.
RESULTS: 30 gastroenterologists at 8 different IBD centres took part in the assessment. A total of 919 patients were included (55% female, 65% Crohn's, 33% ulcerative colitis, 2% indeterminate IBD). Introduction of the proforma increased self-reported gastroenterologist screening from 47% to 97% pre- and post-intervention respectively, p<0.001. After the proforma was applied, vaccination against hepatitis B, varicella, Influenza, and Pneumococcus was recommended in 67%, 2.5%, 75% and 69% of the patients respectively. Of these, 42%, 39%, 66% and 49% patients followed the recommendations and were vaccinated. Cervical smears were recommended in 31%, with 62% of these obtaining the recommended cervical smear.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a screening and vaccination proforma significantly changed gastroenterologist self-reported behaviour. Patient compliance with these recommendations was not optimal and suggests the need for further patient education, in addition to other forms of support.","['Walsh AJ', 'Weltman M', 'Burger D', 'Vivekanandarajah S', 'Connor S', 'Howlett M', 'Radford-Smith G', 'Selby W', 'Veillard AS', 'Grimm MC', 'Travis SP', 'Lawrance IC']",2013,7,10,J Crohns Colitis,"Walsh AJ, et al.

23596286,Comprehensive analysis of varicella-zoster virus proteins using a new monoclonal antibody collection.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of chickenpox and shingles. Due to the virus's restricted host and cell type tropism and the lack of tools for VZV proteomics, it is one of the least-characterized human herpesviruses. We generated 251 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against 59 of the 71 (83%) currently known unique VZV proteins to characterize VZV protein expression in vitro and in situ. Using this new set of MAbs, 44 viral proteins were detected by Western blotting (WB) and indirect immunofluorescence (IF); 13 were detected by WB only, and 2 were detected by IF only. A large proportion of viral proteins was analyzed for the first time in the context of virus infection. Our study revealed the subcellular localization of 46 proteins, 14 of which were analyzed in detail by confocal microscopy. Seven viral proteins were analyzed in time course experiments and showed a cascade-like temporal gene expression pattern similar to those of other herpesviruses. Furthermore, selected MAbs tested positive on human skin lesions by using immunohistochemistry, demonstrating the wide applicability of the MAb collection. Finally, a significant portion of the VZV-specific antibodies reacted with orthologs of simian varicella virus (SVV), thus enabling the systematic analysis of varicella in a nonhuman primate model system. In summary, this study provides insight into the potential function of numerous VZV proteins and novel tools to systematically study VZV and SVV pathogenesis.","['Lenac Roviš T', 'Bailer SM', 'Pothineni VR', 'Ouwendijk WJ', 'Šimić H', 'Babić M', 'Miklić K', 'Malić S', 'Verweij MC', 'Baiker A', 'Gonzalez O', 'von Brunn A', 'Zimmer R', 'Früh K', 'Verjans GM', 'Jonjić S', 'Haas J']",2013,87,12,J Virol,"Lenac Roviš T, et al.

23592715,Projecting adverse event incidence rates using empirical Bayes methodology.,"Although there is considerable interest in adverse events observed in clinical trials, projecting adverse event incidence rates in an extended period can be of interest when the trial duration is limited compared to clinical practice. A naïve method for making projections might involve modeling the observed rates into the future for each adverse event. However, such an approach overlooks the information that can be borrowed across all the adverse event data. We propose a method that weights each projection using a shrinkage factor; the adverse event-specific shrinkage is a probability, based on empirical Bayes methodology, estimated from all the adverse event data, reflecting evidence in support of the null or non-null hypotheses. Also proposed is a technique to estimate the proportion of true nulls, called the common area under the density curves, which is a critical step in arriving at the shrinkage factor. The performance of the method is evaluated by projecting from interim data and then comparing the projected results with observed results. The method is illustrated on two data sets.","['Ma GJ', 'Ganju J', 'Huang J']",2016,25,4,Stat Methods Med Res,"Ma GJ, et al.

23583889,Reduced varicella-zoster-virus (VZV)-specific lymphocytes and IgG antibody avidity in solid organ transplant recipients.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster-virus (VZV) infection may cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. So far, only IgG-anti-VZV antibody concentrations were used to estimate immunity against VZV, but the antibody binding strength (avidity) together with VZV-specific cellular responses have not been evaluated in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients.
METHODS: Thus, we assessed the humoral and cellular immune responses to two doses of the VZV vaccine (vacc) and wild-type VZV infection (wt) in 23 kidney (KTx) and 19 liver transplant (LTx) recipients including children and adults compared to 48 healthy controls (HC) for measurement of IgG-anti-VZV relative avidity index (RAI) and frequency of VZV-specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vaccinated individuals using an adapted ELISA and IFN-gamma ELISPOT, respectively.
RESULTS: KTx(wt) (median RAI 72.3%) or LTx(wt) (79.2%) and KTx(vacc) (91.0%) or LTx(vacc) (72.5%) showed lower avidities compared to HC(wt) (84.5%) and HC(vacc) (94.0%), respectively, despite equally distributed IgG-anti-VZV concentrations. RAI>60% (high avidity) was detected in all HC, but only in 69.0% of SOT patients. KTx(vacc) (median 64 spot forming units SFU/500,000 PBMCs) and LTx(vacc) (67 SFU) had significantly lower VZV-specific cellular responses compared to HC(vacc) (268 SFU).
CONCLUSIONS: The diminished cellular reactivity to VZV has to be considered in SOT patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments when evaluating immunity against VZV. IgG antibody avidity and VZV-specific cellular responses may serve as additional markers to evaluate immunity against VZV in SOT recipients. The role of wild-type exposures and endogenous VZV re-activation on long-term immunity in SOT patients has to be awaited to establish recommendations for vaccine spacing in these patients, considering immunogenicity and safety aspects.","['Prelog M', 'Schönlaub J', 'Jeller V', 'Almanzar G', 'Höfner K', 'Gruber S', 'Eiwegger T', 'Würzner R']",2013,31,20,Vaccine,"Prelog M, et al.

23575988,Childhood infectious diseases and risk of leukaemia in an adult population.,"Our study is aimed at investigating the association between common childhood infectious diseases (measles, chickenpox, rubella, mumps and pertussis) and the risk of developing leukaemia in an adult population. A reanalysis of a large population-based case-control study was carried out. Original data included 1,771 controls and 649 leukaemia cases from 11 Italian areas. To contain recall bias, the analysis was restricted to subjects directly interviewed and with a good quality interview (1,165 controls and 312 cases). Odds ratios (ORs) and their related 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by unconditional polychotomous logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender and occupational and lifestyle exposures. A protective effect of at least one infection (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.97), measles (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.82) and pertussis (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.98) was observed for chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL). The number of infections was strongly inversely associated with the risk of CLL (p = 0.002, test for trend). With regard to the other types of leukaemia, only a protective effect of pertussis was observed for AML (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.32-0.87). Our results pointed out a protective role of childhood infectious diseases on the risk of CLL in adults. Although a specific antioncogenic effect of some infectious disease, especially measles, cannot be ruled out, the observed decrease of risk with increasing number of infections suggests that a more general ""hygiene hypothesis"" could be the most likely explanation of the detected association. The protective role of pertussis remains to be elucidated.","['Parodi S', 'Crosignani P', 'Miligi L', 'Nanni O', 'Ramazzotti V', 'Rodella S', 'Costantini AS', 'Tumino R', 'Vindigni C', 'Vineis P', 'Stagnaro E']",2013,133,8,Int J Cancer,"Parodi S, et al.

23575238,"Varicella death of an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent--Ohio, 2009.","Varicella usually is a self-limited disease but sometimes can result in severe complications and death. Although infants, adults, and immunocompromised persons are at increased risk for severe disease, before varicella vaccine was introduced in 1995, the majority of hospitalizations and deaths from varicella occurred among healthy persons aged <20 years. Introduction of varicella vaccine has substantially decreased varicella incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. This report describes a varicella death in an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent aged 15 years. In April 2012, as part of the routine review of vital statistics records, the Ohio Department of Health identified a 2009 death with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code for varicella as the underlying cause. Because varicella deaths are nationally reportable, the Ohio Department of Health conducted an investigation to validate that the coding was accurate. Investigators learned that, on March 12, 2009, the adolescent girl was admitted to a hospital with a 3-day history of a rash consistent with varicella and a 1-day history of fever and shortness of breath. The patient was started on intravenous acyclovir (on day 4 of illness) and broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, but she died 3 weeks later.

23569149,Comparative analysis of a complement fixation assay and enzyme immunoassay to determine the seroprevalence of measles and varicella in a survey of healthcare workers.,"OBJECTIVE: Seroprevalence surveys of healthcare workers for vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles and varicella, are essential for disease prevention and infection control programmes. The purpose of this study was to compare the complement fixation (CF) assay and an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to determine the prevalence of immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against measles and varicella viruses in healthcare workers.
METHODS: Antimeasles and antivaricella antibody titres were measured simultaneously in serum samples from healthcare workers employed at a Japanese university hospital, using the CF assay and an EIA.
RESULTS: Serum samples were obtained from 898 healthcare workers. Seropositivity rates determined using the CF assay and EIA were 67.8% versus 94.0%, respectively, for measles, and 83.2% versus 97.6% for varicella. Compared with EIA, a nine- and 22-fold higher number of seronegative subjects was identified by the CF assay for measles and varicella, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Differences between the CF assay and EIA in detecting seronegative or seropositive healthcare workers for measles and varicella suggest that undertaking a seroprevalence survey using an EIA, rather than a CF assay, would more accurately determine susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases, in healthcare settings.","['Shibata H', 'Kumakura S', 'Isobe T', 'Hirose M', 'Ohe M', 'Nishimura N', 'Onoda K', 'Nagai A', 'Yamaguchi S']",2013,41,1,J Int Med Res,"Shibata H, et al.

23559842,Prodromal herpes zoster mimicking odontalgia--a diagnostic challenge.,"Herpes zoster (shingles) is caused by reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus which is present due to an earlier varicella infection (chicken-pox). Herpes Zoster is a less common and endemic disease than varicella, although factors causing reactivation are still not well known, but it occurs in older and/or immunocompromised individuals. Involvement of C3, T5, L1, L2 and first division of trigeminal nerve are the most frequently encountered whereas the involvement of second and third division of trigeminal nerve is rarely seen. During the prodromal stage, the only presenting symptom may be odontalgia, which may prove to be a diagnostic challenge for the dentist, since many diseases can cause orofacial pain, and the diagnosis must be properly established before final treatment. Here we present a case of herpes zoster involving the second division of trigeminal nerve masquerading as odontalgia.

23548754,Hope-Simpson's progressive immunity hypothesis as a possible explanation for herpes zoster incidence data.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of both varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (HZ) (shingles). After varicella infection, the virus remains dormant in the host's dorsal ganglia and can reactivate due to waning cell-mediated immunity, causing HZ. Exposure of varicella-immune persons to VZV may boost the host's immune response, resulting in a protective effect against HZ. In this study, we used mathematical models of VZV transmission and HZ development to test the biological hypothesis of ""progressive immunity,"" originally proposed by Hope-Simpson (Proc R Soc Med. 1965;58:9-20), that cell-mediated protection against HZ increases after each episode of exposure to VZV. Predictions from a model incorporating such a hypothesis were compared with those of other concurrent models proposed for explaining HZ epidemiology. The progressive immunity model fits significantly better the age profile of HZ incidence for Finland (years 2000-2006), Italy (2003-2005), Spain (1997-2004), and the United Kingdom (1991-1992), suggesting that this mechanism may be critical in shaping HZ patterns. The model thus validated is an alternative to VZV models currently used to evaluate the impact of mass immunization programs for varicella and therefore extends the range of tools available to assist policy-makers with the present decision paralysis on the introduction of vaccination.","['Guzzetta G', 'Poletti P', 'Del Fava E', 'Ajelli M', 'Scalia Tomba GP', 'Merler S', 'Manfredi P']",2013,177,10,Am J Epidemiol,"Guzzetta G, et al.

23545380,"Long-term effectiveness of varicella vaccine: a 14-Year, prospective cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Varicella vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1995 for individuals ≥12 months of age. A second dose was recommended in the United States in June 2006. Varicella incidence and vaccine effectiveness were assessed in a 14-year prospective study conducted at Kaiser Permanente Northern California.
METHODS: A total of 7585 children vaccinated with varicella vaccine in their second year of life in 1995 were followed up prospectively for breakthrough varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) through 2009. A total of 2826 of these children received a second dose in 2006-2009. Incidences of varicella and HZ were estimated and compared with prevaccine era rates.
RESULTS: In this cohort of vaccinated children, the average incidence of varicella was 15.9 per 1000 person-years, nine- to tenfold lower than in the prevaccine era. Vaccine effectiveness at the end of the study period was 90%, with no indication of waning over time. Most cases of varicella were mild and occurred early after vaccination. No child developed varicella after a second dose. HZ cases were mild, and rates were lower in the cohort of vaccinated children than in unvaccinated children during the prevaccine era (relative risk: 0.61 [95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.89]).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that varicella vaccine is effective at preventing chicken pox, with no waning noted over a 14-year period. One dose provided excellent protection against moderate to severe disease, and most cases occurred shortly after the cohort was vaccinated. The study data also suggest that varicella vaccination may reduce the risks of HZ in vaccinated children.","['Baxter R', 'Ray P', 'Tran TN', 'Black S', 'Shinefield HR', 'Coplan PM', 'Lewis E', 'Fireman B', 'Saddier P']",2013,131,5,Pediatrics,"Baxter R, et al.

METHODS: Phase III, open-label, 2-center trial. Infants previously primed at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age with DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T either without (group 1: N = 218) or with hepatitis B at birth (group 3: N = 130) or control DTwP-Hib, hepatitis B and oral poliovirus vaccine vaccines (group 2: N = 219) received the same vaccine(s) as booster (except hepatitis B for group 2) at 15-18 months of age, coadministered with measles/mumps/rubella and varicella vaccines (MMR+V). All participants had received measles vaccine at 9 months of age. Antibodies were measured prebooster and 1 month postbooster vaccination. Safety was evaluated from parental reports. Analyses were descriptive.
RESULTS: Antibody persistence (seroprotection and concentration) at 15-18 months of age was high for each valence and similar in each group, except for Hep B (highest in group 3 [extra dose of hepatitis B]) and PRP (highest in group 2). Postbooster seroprotection (D, T, IPV, Hep B, PRP) and seroconversion (pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin) rates were high and similar in each group (excluding Hep B in group 2 [no booster]); geometric mean antibody levels increased markedly in all groups. The response to MMR+V was similar in each group. All vaccines were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: A booster dose of the new DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine at 15-18 months of age is highly immunogenic and safe compared with licensed comparators, following primary series administration in the Expanded Program on Immunization schedule, with or without a hepatitis B vaccine at birth and coadministered with MMR+V.","['Madhi SA', 'Koen A', 'Cutland C', 'Groome M', 'Santos-Lima E']",2013,32,8,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Madhi SA, et al.

OBJECTIVE: This article summaries the diagnosis and management of four common neuropathic pain presentations.
DISCUSSION: A validated diagnostic screening tool can help identify patients with neuropathic pain. A systematic approach to clinical assessment and investigation will clarify the diagnosis. Good glycaemic control is important in the prevention and management of diabetic polyneuropathy; management options include antidepressants, gabapentinoids and controlled release opioids. Pain that lasts for more than 3 months after the onset of a herpes zoster infection is called 'postherpetic neuralgia'; management options include prevention with vaccination, early antiviral treatment and gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants, controlled release opioids, capsaicin cream and lignocaine patches. In trigeminal neuralgia, patients complain of severe brief episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve; first line management is with carbamazepine. Complex regional pain syndrome is diagnosed using the Budapest Diagnostic Criteria.

23523405,"Changes in the prevalence of the measles, rubella, varicella-zoster, and mumps virus antibody titers in Japanese pregnant women.","In the present study, immunity against infectious diseases, which are capable of influencing both the mother and fetus during pregnancy and the infant in the postnatal period, were assessed in pregnant women to elucidate the necessity of vaccination during the childbearing age. It was determined that there was a trend of increases in the proportion of patients that had low antibody titers observed at a young age. Overall, after adjusting for age, low antibody titers of measles (≤ 4 via the neutralization test [NT]), rubella (≤ 16 via the hemagglutination inhibition [HI]), and varicella and mumps (plus minus or negative on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EIA]) indicated that the rates of necessity for vaccination against measles, rubella, varicella, and mumps were 27.6%, 16.1%, 3.9%, and 23.8%, respectively. In Japan, acquired immunity for measles, rubella, and mumps was dependent on vaccination, whereas acquired immunity for varicella was dependent on natural infection. We recommend that women be vaccinated after delivery, as these vaccines are live, and thereby, are contraindicated during pregnancy.","['Hanaoka M', 'Hisano M', 'Watanabe N', 'Sugawara K', 'Kambe Y', 'Kanda E', 'Sago H', 'Kato T', 'Yamaguchi K']",2013,31,19,Vaccine,"Hanaoka M, et al.

23498136,Vaccinal status of healthcare students in Lille.,"INTRODUCTION: Vaccine recommendations are the same for healthcare students than for other health care workers. The aim of this study was to describe mandatory and recommended vaccinal coverage and evaluate the benefit of systematic monitoring by a medical team in the Lille Medical School.
POPULATION AND METHODS: A survey was performed from June 2011 to August 2011 on all students in the first year of Health Care Studies. The personal immunization record was considered as evidence of vaccination. The reference vaccinal schedule was the one recommended by the French High Council for Public Health in 2011.
RESULTS: We analyzed the personal immunization records of 553 students. The vaccination coverage was 96.7% (535) for DTP, 74.7% (413) for hepatitis B, and 92.2% (510) of the students had a tuberculin test result. Concerning the recommended vaccinations, 78% (431) were covered for measles, and 78.9% (436) had a history of either chickenpox or its immunization. About 72.7% (402) of students were vaccinated for Haemophilus influenzae and Bordetella pertussis. Respectively, 24.2% (134) and 81% (448) had previously been vaccinated for Neisseria meningitis and tuberculosis. The monitoring of students allowed improving hepatitis B vaccination coverage by 22.28% (123). The student's vaccinal coverage was still inadequate for hepatitis B and measles. The systematic monitoring allowed significantly improving vaccinal coverage for hepatitis B.","['Faure E', 'Cortot C', 'Gosset D', 'Cordonnier A', 'Deruelle P', 'Guery B']",2013,43,3,Med Mal Infect,"Faure E, et al.

23483311,Varicella vaccination in Japan: necessity of implementing a routine vaccination program.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of varicella (chickenpox). It shows extremely high infectivity and is spread by airborne, droplet, and contact transmission. After a person is infected with VZV, the virus remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia, but can be reactivated under circumstances where specific immunity declines, leading to the development of herpes zoster (shingles). Although varicella is a disease that usually resolves after about 1 week, it can cause various complications such as secondary bacterial skin infection, pneumonia, and encephalitis. In addition, varicella can become severe in immunocompromised persons, whereas VZV infection transmitted from an infected mother can cause the congenital varicella syndrome or serious neonatal varicella. In 1974, a live varicella vaccine (Oka strain) was developed in Japan for the prevention of varicella, and clinical trials performed during the development were mainly focused on high-risk children. In 1985, the Oka strain was recognized as the best varicella vaccine strain by the World Health Organization (WHO). Today, all the varicella vaccines used worldwide to immunize approximately 32 million people annually contain the Oka strain. In Japan, it has been commercially available since 1987 for the voluntary vaccination program, in which children over the age of 1 year with no history of previous varicella infection receive a single dose. In addition to healthy children, this vaccine can be used for immunocompromised children, and vaccination of elderly persons can also be done to enhance their immunity against VZV. Varicella vaccine is a highly safe vaccine with sufficient immunogenicity. The preventive effect of single-dose vaccination is believed to be approximately 80 % for all types of varicella, including mild cases; it is 95 % or greater for moderate to severe disease. Implementation of a two-dose vaccination schedule has proved to be effective against breakthrough varicella, which is observed in approximately 20-30 % of children vaccinated with a single dose. Because it is administered as part of the voluntary vaccination program, the varicella vaccination coverage rate in Japan has remained low until recently at around 20-30 %, with no sign of a decrease in the number of varicella patients. It is necessary to maintain a vaccination rate of 90 % or higher to prevent varicella epidemics. To achieve this goal, implementation of a routine vaccination program for varicella and introduction of a two-dose vaccination schedule, which is more effective than a single-dose schedule, would be highly desirable.",['Ozaki T'],2013,19,2,J Infect Chemother,Ozaki T.

23453544,Evaluation of varicella zoster virus infection morbidity and mortality in pancreas and kidney-pancreas transplant recipients.,"BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of infection due to chronic immunosuppression. The incidence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection is known to be increased in these patients compared with the immunocompetent population. Previous reports suggested that these patients are likely to experience a morbid disease course. Few data currently exist on the course of VZV infections in pancreas or pancreas plus kidney (PK) transplant recipients.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the incidence and severity of VZV infections in pancreas or PK recipients.
STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the transplantation patient database of the Royal Victoria Hospital, identifying 137 pancreas or PK transplantation procedures performed between January 1999 and October 2010, among which we included 98 patients in the study. We subsequently performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate the incidence and severity of VZV infections posttransplantation.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that 11/98 patients developed VZV infections. The majority of infections (~90.9%) occurred within the first 5 years. Most patients (63.6%) were treated on an outpatient basis, whereas only 4 (36.4%) were hospitalized with a mean hospital stay of 9.5 ± 8.42 days. The initial immunosuppressive regimen remained unchanged for the majority of patients. All patients experienced a mild disease course without intensive care unit admission or death. Only 3 patients (27.3%) developed postherpetic neuralgia.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that with timely diagnosis and proper treatment, most patients recover well from a VZV infection.","['Netchiporouk E', 'Tchervenkov J', 'Paraskevas S', 'Sasseville D', 'Billick R']",2013,45,2,Transplant Proc,"Netchiporouk E, et al.

Although uncommon, neurologic complications of varicella have been documented that include postinfectious cerebellar ataxia, meningoencephalitis, Reye syndrome, myelitis, optic neuritis, stroke, Guillain-Barré syndrome, seventh cranial nerve palsy, and Ramsay-Hunt syndrome. In this case study, the authors describe a 7-year-old girl who presented with varicella skin rash with unsteady gait and anarthria on day 2, and her condition was attributed to cerebellar mutism. To date, this complication has never been reported in a child with primary varicella infection. Therefore, this case study documents a rare but serious complication of childhood chickenpox.","['Erol I', 'Özkale Y', 'Saygi S', 'Alehan F']",2014,29,6,J Child Neurol,"Erol I, et al.

23434396,Varicella immunity in vaccinated healthcare workers.,"BACKGROUND: Nosocomial spread of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection can cause severe disease among vulnerable patient-populations and healthcare personnel (HCP). Limited data are available on duration of varicella vaccine-induced protection among adults and to what extent cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and antibody avidity contribute to protection.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of HCP who received a 2-dose regimen of varicella vaccine, and observe the responses to a 3rd vaccine dose among HCP who were seronegative after vaccination.
STUDY DESIGN: A convenience sample of HCP with documented 2 doses of varicella vaccine was used to assess acquired VZV immune parameters (cytokine production, IgG avidity). HCP seronegative after 2 doses of vaccine were offered a third dose and evaluated further. Vaccine recipients' immune responses were compared with responses from persons with history of wild-type VZV infection.
RESULTS: The convenience sample consisted of 101 HCP with documented 2 doses of varicella vaccine; 12 (11.9%) were seronegative post-vaccination. 11.5% of 61 seropositive 2-dose recipients produced low avidity antibody, suggesting suboptimal response to vaccine. Seven 2-dose vaccinees who were VZV seronegative seroconverted after a third dose; however, 3/7 (42.9%) produced low avidity IgG. 142 persons with a history of varicella were all VZV IgG seropositive, and all had moderate to high avidity IgG.
CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of serum IgG titers alone may not accurately reflect vaccine protection. Varicella vaccination of HCP remains important but further studies are needed to evaluate CMI and antibody avidity responses in HCP vaccinated with two doses of varicella vaccine.","['Behrman A', 'Lopez AS', 'Chaves SS', 'Watson BM', 'Schmid DS']",2013,57,2,J Clin Virol,"Behrman A, et al.

23429564,"Varicella disease in Beijing in the era of voluntary vaccination, 2007 to 2010.","BACKGROUND: In China, varicella vaccine has been available in the private sector to children ≥12 months of age since 1998 with a single-dose indication. In December 2006, varicella became a notifiable disease in Beijing. We used surveillance data to describe varicella vaccine uptake from 2005 to 2010 and varicella epidemiology in Beijing from 2007 to 2010.
METHODS: Limited sociodemographic and clinical information was available from the passive surveillance system. Varicella vaccine coverage was estimated for each year for children born between 2004 and 2008 using the number of children in the immunization registry of each birth year as the denominator without adjustment for history of varicella.
RESULTS: Vaccine coverage increased within each birth cohort between 2005 and 2010. The coverage at 2 years of age increased from 62.4% in 2005 to 74.1% in 2010 and was 80.4% in children 3-6 years of age in 2010. Between 2007 and 2010, 15,544 to 18,256 varicella cases were reported annually with stable overall incidence (range: 1.0-1.1/1000 persons), but the incidence in children 1-4 years of age decreased significantly from 6.2 per 1000 children in 2007 to 4.4 per 1000 children in 2010 (P < 0.001). Among adults (≥20 years of age), there were significant increases in the number and proportion of cases from 2557 (16.5%) in 2007 to 4277 (23.4%) in 2010 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Moderately high 1-dose vaccine coverage in young children has been achieved with declining disease incidence, but varicella remains a common, seasonal disease in the population. Current epidemiology suggests that a government-funded varicella vaccine program that includes catch-up vaccination for older children, adolescents and adults needs consideration.","['Lu L', 'Wang C', 'Suo L', 'Li J', 'Liu W', 'Pang X', 'Seward JF']",2013,32,8,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Lu L, et al.

23428280,Congenital cytomegalovirus infection in fraternal twins: a longitudinal case study examining neurocognitive and neurobehavioral correlates.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most ubiquitous member of the herpes virus family and is the leading cause of congenital (vertical) infection in newborns (Fowler, Stagno, & Pass, 2003; Llorente, Steigmeyer, Cooper, Rivers, & Gazley, 2011; Noyola et al., 2000; Steigmeyer & Llorente, 2010). CMV is related to the group of viruses capable of causing more pernicious infectious diseases, such as chicken pox (Santos de Barona, 1998). Although the virus generally remains dormant, individuals whose symptoms are clinically apparent often are dramatically affected. Common symptomatic characteristics of the virus include microcephaly, jaundice, liver-spleen infections, pneumonia, cardiac anomalies, chorioretinitis, vision loss, sensory-neural hearing loss, mental retardation, and mononucleosis (Demmler, 1991; Kashden, Frison, Fowler, Pass, & Boll, 1998; Noyola et al., 2000; Pass, 2005; Santos de Barona). The prognosis of individuals with CMV is highly variable, and the prognosis of individuals with congenital CMV can usually be determined based on the extent of infection at birth. The purpose of this investigation is to present longitudinal results of neuropsychological evaluation of two dizygotic twin sets (one twin of each set is asymptomatic CMV-positive and the other is uninfected) who were reared in the same environment. In addition, the present findings are discussed within the context of emerging murine and other animal analogues of CMV as well as within the extant CMV literature.","['Llorente AM', 'Castillo CL']",2012,1,1,Appl Neuropsychol Child,Llorente AM and Castillo CL.

23427162,ORF11 protein interacts with the ORF9 essential tegument protein in varicella-zoster virus infection.,"The tegument proteins encoded by ORF11 and ORF9 of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are conserved among all alphaherpesvirus. We previously demonstrated that the ORF9 gene is essential, whereas ORF11 is dispensable in vitro but its deletion severely impairs VZV infection of skin xenografts in the SCID mouse model in vivo. Here we report that ORF11 protein interacts with ORF9 protein in infected cells as well as in the absence of other viral proteins, and we have mapped the ORF11 protein domain involved in their interaction. Although ORF11 is an RNA binding protein, the interaction between ORF11 and ORF9 proteins was not mediated by RNA or DNA bridging. VZV recombinants with mutations preventing ORF11 protein binding to ORF9 protein had no effect on 6-day growth kinetics based on plaque numbers, but plaque sizes were reduced in vitro. However, disruption of the ORF11 and ORF9 protein interaction was associated with failure to replicate in skin xenografts in vivo. Further, we demonstrate that in the absence of their interaction, the ORF9 protein displays an identical cellular localization, accumulating in the trans-Golgi region, whereas the ORF11 protein exhibits aberrant localization, dispersing throughout the cytoplasm. Overall, our observations suggest that while complete tegument assembly may not be necessary for VZV replication in vitro, the interaction between the ORF11 and ORF9 proteins appears to be critical for the proper localization of ORF11 protein to the assembly complex and for production of infectious virus during VZV pathogenesis in skin.","['Che X', 'Oliver SL', 'Reichelt M', 'Sommer MH', 'Haas J', 'Roviš TL', 'Arvin AM']",2013,87,9,J Virol,"Che X, et al.

METHODS: Healthy children aged 11-22 mo were randomized to receive two doses of either the MMRV(new WS) vaccine or the MMRV vaccine. Antibody titers against measles, mumps and rubella were measured using ELISA and against varicella using an immunofluorescence assay. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of MMRV(new WS) to MMRV in terms of post-dose-1 seroconversion rates, defined as a group difference with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval greater than -10% for each antigen. Parents/guardians recorded symptoms in diary cards for 43 d after each vaccine dose.
RESULTS: Non-inferiority of MMRV(new WS) to MMRV was achieved for all vaccine antigens. The lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals for group differences (MMRV(new WS) group vs. MMRV) for measles (99.4% vs 100%), mumps (89.7% vs 90.4%), rubella (99.7% vs 100%) and varicella (97.6% vs 92.9%) seroconversion rates were greater than -10%. Mild symptoms including a peak in fever between days 5 and 12, post-dose-1, was observed in both groups.
CONCLUSION: The immune responses elicited by the MMRV(new WS) vaccine were non-inferior to that elicited by the MMRV vaccine for all antigens.

There is scarce data on long-term trends of chickenpox and its relation to vaccinations practices. We aimed to evaluate trends of chickenpox in a military population during the period 1979-2010 and to assess temporal associations in relation with the introduction of varicella zoster vaccine to the civilian population in Israel in 2000. The archives of the Epidemiology Section of the Israel Defense Forces, where chickenpox is a notifiable disease, were reviewed for all cases of chickenpox from January 1, 1979-December 31, 2010. Annual and monthly incidence rates were calculated and analyzed in relation to vaccine introduction. Between 1979-2000, incidence rates fluctuated around 10 cases per 10,000 soldiers without a clear trend. Since 2000 there has been a dramatic 10-fold decline in incidence, especially notable since 2008, from eight per 10,000 soldiers in 2000 to the lowest rate ever recorded, in 2009, of 0.57 cases per 10,000 soldiers. A seasonal sinusoidal pattern was clearly demonstrated, with rising incidence from November to May followed by a gradual decline to October. The results of this long-term study suggest that the rates of chickenpox in the military population have significantly declined since the introduction of the vaccine to the civilian population in Israel and almost disappeared completely since 2008 as the vaccine was included in the state-funded routine childhood immunization schedule. These findings underscore the need for a strong surveillance system and will aid in determing vaccination policies.","['Mimouni D', 'Levine H', 'Tzurel Ferber A', 'Rajuan-Galor I', 'Huerta-Hartal M']",2013,9,6,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Mimouni D, et al.

RESULTS: 179 samples from 179 children, 65% male. Ninety eighth/179 (55%) were positive, 72/179 (40%) negative and 9/179 (5%) indeterminate. Stratified by age, seropositive percentage was: 1 to 4 years 32%, 5-9 years 42%, 10-14 years 78%, over 15 years 88%.
CONCLUSION: Forty percent of children treated for cancer are seronegative to VVZ infection, a frequency that decreases with age. These results support the adoption of preventive measures to avoid infection in this population of children at risk of developing a serious and possibly fatal illness.","['Izquierdo G', 'Zubieta M', 'Martínez G MJ', 'Alvarez AM', 'Aviles CL', 'Becker A', 'Peña M', 'Salgado C', 'Silva P', 'Topelberg S', 'Tordecilla J', 'Varas M', 'Villarroel M', 'Viviani T', 'Santolaya ME', 'Subcomité de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Programa Nacional Infantil de Drogas Antineoplásicas (PINDA)']",2012,29,6,Rev Chilena Infectol,"Izquierdo G, et al.

The protective antibody data encountered over the years are similar to that reported in the literature, with coverage percentages greater than 93% for varicella and rubella, over 89% for measles and over 85% for mumps. Approximately 80% of the operators are protected against all four diseases. However, the dramatic consequences of potential contagion lead us to strongly recommend vaccinations for non-protected subjects.

Residual blood samples were collected from diagnostic laboratories throughout Korea. Samples were collected in October 2009 to March 2010 from persons 0-79 yr of age and were tested by ELISA (Enzygnost®; Dade Behring, Schwalbach, Germany). Total seroprevalence in subjects 1-79 yr of age was 89.6%. Seroprevalence increased as age increased from 67.3% in subjects 1-4 yr of age to 94.2% in subjects 10-14 yr of age and in subjects over 20 yr of age seroprevalence ranged from 98.0% to 100%. In children under 1 yr of age, passive immunity waned after birth with none of the subjects having antibodies from 7 months of age and over. Among subjects 1-79 yr of age, susceptible subjects to VZV were mainly under 20 yr of age.

During the period 1999-2010 a total of 189 cases was submitted to the Division of Animal Pathomorphology, Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics at WULS. Most cases were found in broiler chickens (66.7%). The majority of the histopathological lesions were detected in the liver and lymphoid organs. In of 29% cases of hepatic injury pathognomonic lesions associated with inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) were found. The mean age of birds was 23 days. Among IBH cases proventriculitis (58%) was more often found than gizzard lesions (25.8%). Interestingly, we noted some intranuclear inclusions in the epithelial cells within the proventriculus. A low percentage of histopathological evidence of infectious bursal disease (IBD) was reported in chickens. The gastrointestinal tract was the second most frequent predilection site for histopathological lesions. Histopathological findings within the heart and lungs were less common and were more often seen in the upper respiratory tract. Cases of infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) were registered in broiler chickens (3.2%, mean age 37 days) and in layers (4.8%; mean age 196 days).

23377760,Acute viral infections of the central nervous system in immunocompetent adults: diagnosis and management.,"Patients with viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) may present with a variety of neurological symptoms, most commonly dominated by either encephalitis or meningitis. The aetiological panorama varies in different parts of the world as well as over time. Thus, virological first-line diagnostics must be adapted to the current epidemiological situation and to the individual patient history, including recent travels. This review focuses on the diagnostics and treatment of viral CNS infections in the immunocompetent host from a Northern European perspective. Effective vaccines are available for viruses such as poliovirus and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and for the childhood diseases morbilli (measles), rubella (German measles), parotitis (mumps) and varicella (chickenpox). However, cases do appear due to suboptimal immunization rates. In viral CNS infections, epidemiological surveillance is essential for establishing preventive strategies and for detecting emerging viruses. Knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of diagnostic methods for specific viral CNS infections is vital. A positive cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) finding is usually reliable for aetiological diagnosis. The demonstration of intrathecal antibody synthesis is useful for confirming the aetiology in a later stage of disease, hitherto sufficiently evaluated in herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). Despite improved virological and differential diagnostic methods, aetiology remains unknown in about half of the cases with suspected viral encephalitis. Antiviral treatment is available chiefly for infections caused by herpesviruses, and acyclovir (aciclovir) is the drug of choice for empirical therapy in suspected viral encephalitis. However, randomized, controlled antiviral trials have only been conducted for HSE, while such studies are lacking in other viral CNS infections. Viral cytolysis and immune-mediated mechanisms may contribute to varying extents to neurological damage. Although the brain damage is believed to depend, to a varying degree, on the intrathecal host immune response, the use of corticosteroids in viral CNS infections is scarcely studied, as is specific treatment for neuroinflammation. Improved antiviral and immunomodulating treatment is desirable. Since neurological sequelae are still abundant, follow-up after severe viral CNS disease must include a neuropsychological assessment and an individually adapted rehabilitation plan.","['Studahl M', 'Lindquist L', 'Eriksson BM', 'Günther G', 'Bengner M', 'Franzen-Röhl E', 'Fohlman J', 'Bergström T', 'Aurelius E']",2013,73,2,Drugs,"Studahl M, et al.

We investigated changes in immunogenicity associated with vaccination using a reduced dose whose virus titer was close to that used when the vaccine was developed, and examined the need for the virus titer presently used. In a non blinded study of 43 children with no history of varicella infection, we administered 0.1 mL of varicella vaccine (1/5 of the normal dose) to 20 children 1 year 0 month to 4 years 5 months old (median: 1 year 5 months) and the standard 0.5mL dose to 23 children 1 year 2 months to 3 years 7 months old (median: 1 year 9 months). We measured IAHA and gpELISA antibody titer before vaccination and 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination. We defined ""positive"" as > or = 2 fold of IAHA titer and > or = 50 U of gpELISA antibody titer. We administered an additional 0.5mL of varicella vaccine to children whose IAHA titer failed to show seroconversion and remeasured antibody titer 4 to 6 weeks after revaccination. IAHA seroconversion was 25.0% (5/20) and gpELISA seroconversion 55.0% (11/20) in the 0.1 mL vaccination group, which was lower than that of 76.2% (16/21) and 87.0% (20/23), IAHA p < 0.01, gpELISA p < 0.05, in the 0.5 mL vaccination group. We administered an additional vaccination to 19 children--15 in the 0.1 mL vaccination group and 4 in the 0.5 mL vaccination group-with 100% seroconversion for both methods. Mean antibody titer after revaccination in the 0.1 mL vaccination group (IAHA 2 (6.0), gpELISA 10 (3.7)) was higher than those in the 0.5mL vaccination group who seroconverted following initial vaccination (IAHA 2(4.5), gpELISA 10(2.6)) (p < 0.01). We also measured virus titer in the remaining vaccine following vaccination of 0.1 mL (n = 20), and estimated virus titer administered to the 0.1 mL vaccination group to be 2,600-6,400 PFU/ dose. Varicella vaccine immunogenicity decreased if dosage was reduced to 1/5 of the standard dose, indicating that the present virus titer is necessary to maintain adequate immunogenicity. An additional administration of the standard dose to children who failed to seroconvert after initial 0.1 mL administration produced high antibody titers thought to constitute a booster effect.","['Ozaki T', 'Nishimura N', 'Gotoh K', 'Funahashi K']",2012,86,6,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Ozaki T, et al.

In the solid organ transplant (SOT) population, manifestations of VZV or HSV may be seen in up to 70% of recipients if no prophylaxis is used, some of them life and organ threatening. While there are effective vaccines to prevent VZV primary infection and reactivation in immunocompetent adults, these vaccines are contraindicated after SOT because they are live-virus vaccines. For HSV, prevention has focused primarily on antiviral strategies because the immunologic correlates of protection and control are different from VZV, making vaccine development more challenging.

23352485,Don't forget how severe varicella can be--complications of varicella in children in a defined Polish population.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze the causes of hospitalization in children with varicella, based on a defined Polish population.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of causes of hospitalization in children under 18 years of age with varicella, treated on the Infectious Diseases Ward of the Children's Hospital in Poznan, Poland from January 2007 to June 2012. The ward serves almost the entire child population of the Greater Poland region (10% of the Polish population - almost 600,000 children). The analysis was based on hospital records. Patients were identified using the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. The case definition consisted of physical evidence of varicella.
RESULTS: A total of 224 children were hospitalized for varicella complications. The median age of admitted patients was 37.5 months (range 6 days to 17 years). Rates of hospitalization decreased with age. The highest rates were among children during their first year. Ninety-two percent of children were healthy prior to hospitalization (no chronic diseases). The most common complications were respiratory tract infections (26%), followed by skin infections (21%) and neurological symptoms (18%). Twenty-five patients (11%) had more than one complication. The most common coexisting conditions were dehydration and otitis media.
CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here serve to remind us that varicella may to lead to severe complications in unvaccinated children and adolescents, and demonstrate the benefits of varicella vaccination. Most children hospitalized with varicella were immunologically healthy. Meningitis was more common in older children (>6 years of age).

23335045,A systematic review of the cost effectiveness of herpes zoster vaccination.,"BACKGROUND: The varicella zoster virus (VZV) can cause two infections: chickenpox or herpes zoster (HZ). Whereas chickenpox infections are normally mild but common among children, HZ infections are common among elderly people and can give rise to post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a severe and painful complication.
OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to summarize the literature available on the cost effectiveness of HZ vaccination and to summarize key issues for decision makers to consider when deciding on the reimbursement of HZ vaccination.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search of the databases PubMed and EMBASE using EndNote X4 from Thomson Reuters. The following combinations of keywords were used: 'herpes zoster vaccine' AND 'cost(-)effectiveness' or AND 'economic evaluation', 'herpes zoster vaccination' AND 'cost(-)effectiveness' or AND 'economic evaluation', 'varicella zoster vaccine' AND 'cost(-)effectiveness' or AND 'economic evaluation', and 'varicella zoster vaccination' AND 'cost(-)effectiveness' or AND 'economic evaluation'.
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies were identified and included. Cost-effectiveness analyses of varicella zoster vaccination were excluded. The quality of the included studies ranged from 'moderate' to 'moderate to good' according to the British Medical Journal guidelines of Drummond and Jefferson and the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) score of Ofman et al. Most studies evaluated the cost effectiveness of universal HZ vaccination in adults aged 50 years or 60 years and older. Data sources and model assumptions regarding epidemiology, utility estimates and costs varied between studies. All studies calculated costs per QALY, which allows comparing costs of interventions in different diseases. The costs per QALY gained and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) differed between studies depending on the age at vaccination, duration of vaccine efficacy, cost of vaccine course and economic perspective. All but one of the studies concluded that most vaccination scenarios are cost effective and the vaccination of specific subgroups such as the older age group is most cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Model input parameters such as age at vaccination, vaccine costs, HZ incidence, PHN length and duration of vaccine efficacy had a great impact on the estimated cost effectiveness of HZ vaccination. To compare the results of different cost-effectiveness studies of HZ vaccination, uniform methods should be used and the most important input parameters used for the different models should be critically assessed.","['Szucs TD', 'Pfeil AM']",2013,31,2,Pharmacoeconomics,Szucs TD and Pfeil AM.

The cases were 54 children aged 15 months to 10 years with a diagnosis of varicella confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction. Each case was matched with eight controls by pediatric practice, district of residence and date of birth. The effectiveness was 87% (95% confidence interval: 60% to 97%) for one dose of vaccine and 97% (80% to 100%) for two doses. A single dose was 93% (34% to 100%) effective in the first year, which declined to 61% (95% CI: -64% to 94%) after the third year.

23321955,Childhood varicella-zoster virus vaccination in Belgium: cost-effective only in the long run or without exogenous boosting?,"AIM: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a universal childhood varicella-zoster vaccination programme in Belgium (1) using the most recent Belgian data on varicella-zoster burden, (2) exploring different options for the timing of the second dose, (3) obtaining results with and without exogenous natural boosting, and (4) investigating the possible additional benefit of zoster booster vaccination for adults at age 50 or 60 y.
METHODS: An extensively studied and improved dynamic model is used to estimate primary and breakthrough chickenpox and zoster cases over time. For a range of vaccination options, we compared the direct costs (health care payer perspective) and health outcomes (including Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) lost) associated with chickenpox and herpes zoster. Estimates of social contact patterns, health care use, costs and QALY losses are almost exclusively based on Belgian databases and surveys.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: If exogenous natural boosting exists, a net loss in QALYs is expected for several decades after implementing a universal chickenpox vaccination programme, due to an increase in zoster mainly in persons aged 50-80 y. This result holds also for scenarios that minimise or counteract the expected increase in zoster incidence (e.g. additional booster vaccinations in adults). However, if the boosting hypothesis is not true or if costs and QALYs are cumulated over at least 33 to more than 100 y after vaccination (depending on the assumptions made), different options for universal 2-dose vaccination against chickenpox in Belgium would be cost-effective at a vaccine price of €43/dose or lower.","['Bilcke J', 'van Hoek AJ', 'Beutels P']",2013,9,4,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Bilcke J, et al.

Five patients showed venous thromboembolism characterized by deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Comparison of activated partial thromboplastin time, antithrombin III, D-dimer, lupus anticoagulant, free S protein (PS), C protein, and antiphospholipid and PS antibodies was performed on children with acute VZV and DVT (group I), acute uncomplicated VZV (group II), and 30 healthy controls of both sexes (15 boys and 15 girls, mean age 7.5 ± 2.6 years, group III). Genetic thrombophilic mutations (Factor V Leiden, MTHFR C677T, and Prothrombin G20210A) were evaluated. Coagulation disorders and PS antibody were found in children with acute VZV (groups I and II). Significant differences were shown among the three groups (P < 0.05).

23320222,Optic neuritis in an adult patient with chickenpox.,"Central nervous system involvement in a patient with primary infection with Varicella zoster virus is rare, especially in the immunocompetent adult. In particular, isolated optic neuritis has been described in a small number of cases. The authors present a case of optic neuritis in an immunocompetent patient. A 28-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with a history of headaches during the previous week, without visual symptoms. The examination was unremarkable, except for a rash suggestive of chickenpox and hyperemic and edematous optic disc, bilaterally. Visual acuity and neurological examination were normal. Two days later, she complained of pain on eye movement and decreased visual acuity, which was 20/32 in her right eye and 20/60 in her left eye. Four days after admission, her visual acuity started to improve, and two months later, she had 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an immunocompetent adult in which a Varicella zoster virus associated optic neuritis presented with fundoscopic changes before decreased visual acuity. This suggests that this condition may be underdiagnosed in asymptomatic patients.","['Azevedo AR', 'Simões R', 'Silva F', 'Pina S', 'Santos C', 'Pêgo P', 'Silva F', 'Teixeira S']",2012,2012,,Case Rep Ophthalmol Med,"Azevedo AR, et al.

23303966,"Latency of varicella zoster virus in dorsal root, cranial, and enteric ganglia in vaccinated children.","Despite vaccination, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) remains an important pathogen. We investigated VZV latency in autopsy specimens from vaccinees, in gastrointestinal tissue removed surgically, and in a guinea pig model. We propose that retrograde transport from infected skin and viremia deliver VZV to neurons in which it becomes latent. Wild type (WT) VZV was found to be latent in many ganglia of vaccinated children with no history of varicella, suggesting that subclinical infection with WT-VZV occurs with subsequent viremic dissemination. The 30% to 40% rate of WT-VZV zoster reported in vaccinees and occasional trigeminal zoster due to vaccine type VZV (vOka) are consistent with viremic delivery of VZV to multiple ganglia. Most human intestinal specimens contained latent VZV within neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS). Induction of viremia in guinea pigs led to VZV latency throughout the ENS. The possibility VZV reactivation in the ENS is an unsuspected cause of gastrointestinal disease requires future investigation.","['Gershon AA', 'Chen J', 'Davis L', 'Krinsky C', 'Cowles R', 'Reichard R', 'Gershon M']",2012,123,,Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc,"Gershon AA, et al.

23297526,Acute appendicitis as a complication of varicella.,"INTRODUCTION: Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen is the primary cause of appendicitis. The most common causes of luminal obstruction are fecaliths and lymphoid follicle hyperplasia. Additionally, bacterial infections or enteric and systemic viral diseases can cause a reaction of the lymphoid follicle.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-year-old boy with active phase of chickenpox presented on our Pediatric surgery emergency department under the impression of acute appendicitis. An appendectomy was performed on the same day. An inflamed and edematous retrocecal appendix was removed during surgery. Histological investigation of the appendix revealed transmural acute inflammation, with diffuse proliferation of inflammatory cells, with characteristic intranuclear inclusion surrounded by a clear halo. The PCR analysis of peripheral blood and appendix tissue specimen revealed positive VZV DNA.
CONCLUSION: We have shown that varicella-zoster virus infection of the appendix is associated with acute appendicitis and possibly also with severity of the disease.","['Pogorelić Z', 'Biocić M', 'Jurić I', 'Milunović KP', 'Mrklić I']",2012,55,3,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove),"Pogorelić Z, et al.

23291844,"Susceptibility to measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella-zoster viruses among healthcare workers.","BACKGROUND: It is important to identify and immunize susceptible healthcare workers to prevent and control hospital infections. Our aim was to evaluate the specific antibodies against the measles, mumps, and rubella viruses and the varicella zoster virus among healthcare workers in a tertiary-care hospital.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 284 healthcare workers (89 men and 195 women; mean age, 33.5 ± 11 years), including 111 nurses, 87 physicians, 34 laboratory technicians, and 52 members of the housekeeping staff, of Van Training and Research Hospital were enrolled in this study. Antibodies were detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The numbers of workers with serological susceptibility to mumps, measles, rubella, or chicken pox were 26 (9.2%), 18 (6.3%), 7 (2.5%), and 5 (1.8%), respectively. Although the difference was not statistical significant, the rate of seroprevalence of antibodies was lowest for measles (90.8%; p>0.05). Susceptibility to measles, mumps, and rubella, and chicken pox was more prevalent among young healthcare workers (p<0.001). Not all healthcare workers born before 1957 were immune to these vaccine-preventable diseases.
CONCLUSION: These data confirm that screening and vaccination of susceptible healthcare workers is essential regardless of age.","['Aypak C', 'Bayram Y', 'Eren H', 'Altunsoy A', 'Berktaş M']",2012,79,6,J Nippon Med Sch,"Aypak C, et al.

Nocardia was detected on an aspiration biopsy of the small blisters and the surgically removed testis at a later date. Testicular nocardiosis is a rare condition; however, we should consider nocardiosis in the differential diagnosis because delay in providing treatment may worsen a patient's general condition.","['Yamaguchi H', 'Sekimoto E', 'Shirakami A', 'Shibata H', 'Ozaki S', 'Shigekiyo T', 'Noda T', 'Shikiji T', 'Kanda K', 'Hirose T', 'Matsuzawa T', 'Gonoi T']",2013,52,1,Intern Med,"Yamaguchi H, et al.

23290837,Evaluation of Australia's varicella vaccination program for children and adolescents.,"OBJECTIVE: This paper examines how the monovalent varicella vaccine for children, with an adolescent catch-up dose, was introduced into Australia's National Immunisation Program (NIP), focusing on programme implementation.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants involved in programme implementation. Key themes from interviews were identified through content analysis. Childhood coverage was assessed using data from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) with adolescent coverage obtained from state/territory immunisation programmes. Seroprevalence data were analysed from national serosurveys conducted before and after programme commencement.
RESULTS: Implementation challenges for both parents and providers included: (a) parental report of previous infection as an exclusion criterion; (b) introducing a vaccine on its own at 18 months of age; and (c) adding the adolescent dose into existing school-based vaccination programmes with parental reported exclusion criteria. Despite these challenges, coverage rapidly reached 83% by 24 months of age and 30-33% for the adolescent catch-up dose. When considered in conjunction with estimated pre-vaccination natural immunity in both target groups (20% and 83%, respectively) coverage can be considered high. The serosurvey under-estimated coverage in 2-year-old children but was useful to assess trends in population immunity.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of a single dose of monovalent varicella vaccine at 18 months of age and a school-based catch-up programme at 11-13 years of age successfully achieved high coverage, notwithstanding some challenges. Reported natural infection has been an exclusion criterion for vaccination, but as the programme matures and circulation of wild-type virus decreases, the need for this warrants consideration. There is a need for sensitive laboratory assays to measure vaccine-induced immunity at a population level.","['Ward K', 'Dey A', 'Hull B', 'Quinn HE', 'Macartney K', 'Menzies R']",2013,31,10,Vaccine,"Ward K, et al.

23286673,Impact of MMRV combination vaccine on childhood vaccination compliance.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of using the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV) instead of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the varicella vaccine separately (MMR+V) on uptake of vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) in young children.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Electronic immunization records of children 12 to 15 months of age who received either MMR+V (n = 29,716) or MMRV (n = 29,711) between November 2003 and June 2007 while enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Southern California were evaluated. Proportions of children who received either MMRV or MMR+V and other ACIP-recommended vaccines either simultaneously or during recommended age intervals were compared.
RESULTS: Concomitant administration of DTaP (76.3 vs 75.6%), PCV7 (89.1 vs 78.6%), Hib (92.3 vs 91.3%), and hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) (44.2 vs 0.1%) and on-time administration of PCV7 (91.7 vs 78.7%), Hib (93.9 vs 93.2%), and HAV (86.8 vs 24.3%) were greater with MMRV than with MMR+V. On-time administration of DTaP (91.4 vs 90.5%) and IPV (91.3 vs 90.0%) was greater with MMR+V than with MMRV.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant and on-time administration of most ACIP-recommended vaccines was greater with MMRV than with MMR+V despite the addition of HAV to the recommended schedule after introduction of MMRV. However, the modest compliance increases suggest that focusing on other barriers to compliance may be important to increasing adherence to future vaccination recommendations.","['Ackerson BK', 'Sy LS', 'Yao JF', 'Cheetham CT', 'Jacobsen SJ']",2012,18,12,Am J Manag Care,"Ackerson BK, et al.

23284855,Time trends in pediatric hospitalizations for varicella infection are associated with climatic changes: a 22-year retrospective study in a tertiary Greek referral center.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The transmission rate of air-borne infectious diseases may vary secondary to climate conditions. The study assessed time trends in the seasonality of hospitalized varicella cases in a temperate region in relation to climatic parameters prior to the implementation of universal varicella immunization.
METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted among all pediatric and adolescent varicella patients (n = 2366) hospitalized at the ""Aghia Sophia"" Children's Hospital during 1982-2003 in Athens, Greece. Date of infection was computed based on hospital admission date. Seasonal and monthly trends in the epidemiology of varicella infection were assessed with time series analysis (ARIMA modeling procedure). The correlation between the frequency of varicella patients and the meteorological parameters was examined by the application of Generalized Linear Models with Gamma distribution.
RESULTS: During 1982-2003, the occurrence of hospitalized varicella cases increased during summer (p = 0.025) and decreased during autumn (p = 0.021), and particularly in September (p = 0.003). The frequency of hospitalized varicella cases was inversely associated with air temperature (p<0.001). In contrast, the occurrence of hospitalized varicella cases was positively associated with wind speed (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric hospitalizations for varicella infection rates have increased during summer and decreased during autumn in the examined temperate region.

23283051,Clinical epidemiology of chickenpox in Iraq from 2007-2011.,"UNLABELLED: Varicella zoster (chickenpox) infection is an acute common disease caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). Children are most susceptible to infection. In non-vaccinated populations, primary infection tends to occur at a younger age. In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that routine childhood varicella vaccination be considered in countries where the disease is a relatively important public health and socioeconomic problem, and where high (85 to 90%) and sustained vaccine coverage can be achieved.
AIM: 1- To determine the trend (occurrence, age and gender distribution, seasonal variation) of registered clinical cases of chickenpox in Iraq from 2007-2011. 2- To determine the need for the use of chicken pox vaccine in Iraq and putting a plan for its use accordingly.
METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study.
RESULTS: Frequency of clinical cases shows an obvious rise in the registration of chickenpox cases from 21798 case in 2007 through 59681 in 2008 to 74195 in 2011 with possible outbreaks occurred in 2008 and 2011. Rate of occurrence of clinical chickenpox cases also shows an obvious rise in the occurrence that ranges from 73.41/100000 in 2007 to 222.61/100000 in 2011. The rate in 2008 and 2011 is suggestive of a possible outbreak. Although the total number of chickenpox varies from 2007-2011 but all have shown the same seasonal distribution, being highest in spring (April, May) season. The largest no. recorded was in 2011 (14000 cases in April and May). The lowest no. recorded was in 2007 (4000 cases in April and May).The highest registered number of chickenpox cases was in provinces of Ninawa, Baghdad/russafa, Dihok, Baghdad/karkh, Al-Basrah, As-Sulaymaniyah. Regarding gender distribution there was sustained preponderance for the males over females with nearly the same percentage over the years. Age distribution of the registered cases had shown that most of the cases occurred in those of age 5-14 years (65%), only 1% occur in those &gt;45 years with statistical significance p=0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: 1- There is a rising trend in the registration of clinical chickenpox cases. 2- Most cases occur in the age group of less than 15 years. Males are a little bit higher than females. 3- The highest frequencies were reported in March, April, and May.4- Most of the cases were registered in Baghdad, Ninawa, Dihok and Al-Basrah.","['Khaleel HA', 'Abdelhussein HM']",2012,5,1,Glob J Health Sci,Khaleel HA and Abdelhussein HM.

This study purported to investigate their prevalence and risk factors among healthcare workers from Limpopo province of South Africa.
METHODS: Cases about occupational infectious diseases of healthcare workers from Limpopo province that were submitted to the Compensation Commissioner from January 2006 to December 2009 were reviewed.
RESULTS: The total number of cases of infectious diseases reported during the study period was 56; of these, 83.9% (47) of cases were for tuberculosis, 10.7% (6) for cholera, and 5.4% (3) for chickenpox. Nurses were the most affected. Risk factors associated with the acquisition of infection diseases were as follows. The majority of those infected were female (67.9%), aged over 40 years (57.1%), and who had worked for over 10 years (59.2%). With regard to length of time it took for one to be infected, overall it took 13.6±9.7 years from the year of employment to being infected. This duration was just 5.7±4.2 years in HCWs younger than 40 years versus 18.4±9.0 years in those 40 years and over (p=0.001); and 11.4±10.3 years in nurses versus 17.1±7.8 years in non-professional staff members (p=0.046). Mopani district, situated in a rural setting was the most affected as 24 of the 47 cases of tuberculosis occurred there.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the most common occupational infection or hospital acquired infection among healthcare workers in Limpopo province of South Africa was tuberculosis. It infected mainly nurses from the rural health district of Mopani. Younger age and being a nurse were significant risk factors associated with being infected early.","['Malangu N', 'Legothoane A']",2012,5,1,Glob J Health Sci,Malangu N and Legothoane A.

METHODS: Seroepidemiological survey (n = 436) on VZV of schoolchildren living in the Cochabamba region of Bolivia in 2010. An ELISA test was used to measure varicella antibodies. Parents or guardians completed a questionnaire regarding socio-demographic information (age, gender, living area, parental educational level, presence of siblings and number of family members in the household), and a blood sample was collected from each child to check for VZV antibodies. A descriptive and bivariate analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The global prevalence of VZV was 78.2% (95% CI 74.3-82.1). It was higher in females (82.1%), pre-adolescents (aged 10.1-13 years: 81.4%) and adolescents (aged >13 years: 80.2%), in children with less well-educated parents (81.3% to 81.6%), in warmer municipalities (81.4% to 82.2%), in rural areas (80.0%), in children with siblings (80.1%), those who although the latter association was not statistically significant.

29702869,Children Hospitalized for Varicella: Complications and Cost Burden.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the direct medical cost of hospital admissions for patients with varicella (i.e., chickenpox) to assess the cost burden of varicella from a health care perspective for ultimate use in health economics studies in Turkey.
METHODS: Records of children hospitalized with varicella at the Bakirkoy Maternity and Children's Hospital between November of 2006 and June of 2011 were reviewed. Reasons for hospitalization, types of varicella-associated complications, and direct medical cost of hospitalization were noted. Patients with underlying risk factors were excluded. Data obtained from one hospital were used to estimate the national cost of the disease.
RESULTS: During the 4.5-year study period, 234 patients were hospitalized with varicella. Of these cases, 48 (20%) children previously ill with underlying cancers or chronic diseases were excluded from the study. Ultimately, 186 previously healthy children (age range: 14 days to 159 months, median age: 14 months) were included. The main reasons for hospitalization were complications related to varicella (79%), the most frequent of which was skin and soft tissue infections, followed by neurological complications and pneumonia. The median cost of hospitalization per patient was US $283, 50% of which was attributed to medication costs. The annual cost for varicella hospitalizations in Turkey was estimated at US $396,200.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of healthy children are hospitalized for varicella and associated complications. Descriptions of these complications and their related costs provide important data for cost-effectiveness studies for decisions about the inclusion of the varicella vaccine in a childhood vaccination program.","['Turel O', 'Bakir M', 'Gonen I', 'Hatipoglu N', 'Aydogmus C', 'Hosaf E', 'Siraneci R']",2013,2,2,Value Health Reg Issues,"Turel O, et al.

25437040,Animal models of varicella zoster virus infection.,"Primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) results in varicella (chickenpox) followed by the establishment of latency in sensory ganglia. Declining T cell immunity due to aging or immune suppressive treatments can lead to VZV reactivation and the development of herpes zoster (HZ, shingles). HZ is often associated with significant morbidity and occasionally mortality in elderly and immune compromised patients. There are currently two FDA-approved vaccines for the prevention of VZV: Varivax® (for varicella) and Zostavax® (for HZ). Both vaccines contain the live-attenuated Oka strain of VZV. Although highly immunogenic, a two-dose regimen is required to achieve a 99% seroconversion rate. Zostavax vaccination reduces the incidence of HZ by 51% within a 3-year period, but a significant reduction in vaccine-induced immunity is observed within the first year after vaccination. Developing more efficacious vaccines and therapeutics requires a better understanding of the host response to VZV. These studies have been hampered by the scarcity of animal models that recapitulate all aspects of VZV infections in humans. In this review, we describe different animal models of VZV infection as well as an alternative animal model that leverages the infection of Old World macaques with the highly related simian varicella virus (SVV) and discuss their contributions to our understanding of pathogenesis and immunity during VZV infection.","['Haberthur K', 'Messaoudi I']",2013,2,2,Pathogens,Haberthur K and Messaoudi I.

Tuberculosis, measles and chicken pox were not associated with PD. Other infectious diseases we asked for were not reported (12 diseases), or were too rare (four diseases) to be analysed.
CONCLUSION: The results obtained are in line with the suggestion that some infectious diseases may play a role in the development of PD.","['Vlajinac H', 'Dzoljic E', 'Maksimovic J', 'Marinkovic J', 'Sipetic S', 'Kostic V']",2013,123,5,Int J Neurosci,"Vlajinac H, et al.

23266419,Estimation of basic reproduction numbers: individual heterogeneity and robustness to perturbation of the contact function.,"The basic reproduction number of an infection in a given population, R0, is inflated by individual heterogeneity in contact rates. Recently, new methods for estimating R0 using social contact data and serological survey data have been proposed. These methods, like most of their predecessors, ignore individual heterogeneity, and are sensitive to perturbation of the contact function. Using a frailty framework, we derive expressions for R0 in the presence of age-varying heterogeneity. In this case, R0 is the spectral radius of a population version of the next generation operator, which involves the variance function of the age-dependent frailty. This variance can be estimated within a shared frailty framework from paired data on two infections transmitted by the same route. We propose two estimators of R0 for infections in endemic equilibrium. We investigate their performance by simulation, and find that one is generally less efficient but more robust than the other to perturbation of the effective contact function. These methods are applied to data on varicella zoster virus infection from two European countries.","['Farrington CP', 'Unkel S', 'Anaya-Izquierdo K']",2013,14,3,Biostatistics,"Farrington CP, et al.

23249914,Changes in patterns of hospitalized children with varicella and of associated varicella genotypes after introduction of varicella vaccine in Australia.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella in children, although usually mild, can cause hospitalization and rarely death. This study examined patterns of hospitalized children with varicella, and associated varicella genotypes, in 4 tertiary children's hospitals throughout Australia before and after varicella vaccine was introduced.
METHODS: We obtained coded data on discharge diagnoses from each hospital before (1999 to 2001) and after (2007 to 2010) varicella vaccine introduction in 2005, adding active surveillance to capture clinical features, complications and immunization history in the latter period. Varicella vesicles were swabbed, and genotyping of varicella strains was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification.
RESULTS: Overall, a 68% reduction in coded hospitalizations (varicella, 73.2% [P < 0.001]; zoster, 40% [P = 0.002]) occurred post-vaccine introduction. Of children with detailed clinical data (97 varicella and 18 zoster cases), 46 (40%) were immunocompromised. Only 6 of 32 (19%) age-eligible immunocompetent children were immunized. Complications, most commonly secondary skin infections (n = 25) and neurologic conditions (n = 14), occurred in 44% of children. There were no deaths; but 3 immunocompetent unimmunized children had severe multiple complications requiring intensive care. All strains genotyped were ""wild-type"" varicella, with Clade 1 (European origin) predominating.
CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of varicella vaccine, coverage of greater than 80% at 2 years of age was achieved, with varicella hospitalizations reduced by almost 70%. Of hospitalized children age-eligible for varicella vaccine, 80% were unimmunized, including all cases requiring intensive care.","['Marshall HS', 'McIntyre P', 'Richmond P', 'Buttery JP', 'Royle JA', 'Gold MS', 'Wood N', 'Elliott EJ', 'Zurynski Y', 'Toi CS', 'Dwyer DE', 'Booy R']",2013,32,5,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Marshall HS, et al.

Every HIV-positive immigrant was tested for VZV and MMR-IgG. MMR vaccine was indicated to patients with lymphocytes CD4+ >200 cells/mm³ and a negative measles-IgG, a negative mumps-IgG and/or a negative rubella-IgG. VZV vaccine was indicated to every VZV-IgG negative patient with CD4+ >400 cells/mm³. In total, 289 patients were screened; seroprevalence was 95.2%, 92.2%, 70.3% and 89.3% for VZV, measles, mumps and rubella IgG, respectively. Having a negative VZV-IgG was statistically associated with coming from sub-Saharan Africa (prevalence ratio [PR]: 6.52; 95% CI: 1.71-24.84; p=0.006), while having secondary education was a protective factor (PR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.07-0.97; p=0.045). Fourteen patients (4.8%) had indication of VZV vaccine; vaccination was feasible in 21.4% of them at first visit. Eighty-one patients (29.7%) had indication of MMR vaccine, most of them due to mumps-IgG negative (53.1%) or rubella-IgG negative (24.7%). Age < 30 years at first visit was the only factor statistically associated with MMR vaccine indication (PR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.02-2.11; p=0.04). According to CD4+ cell counts, vaccination was feasible in 71.6% of patients at first visit. In conclusion, more than a third of HIV-infected immigrant patients are susceptible to at least one easily preventable infectious disease.

23233938,[The genotyping and molecular evolution of varicella-zoster virus].,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV, Human herpesvirus 3) is a member of the family Herpesviridae, and is classified as alpha-subfamily along with HSV-1 and HSV-2. VZV is the causative agent of chicken pox (varicella) mostly in children, after which it establishes latency in the sensory ganglia with the potential to reactivate at a later time to cause shingles (zoster). Increasing molecular epidemiological studies in recent years have been performed to monitor the mutations in VZV genome, discriminate vaccine virus from wild type virus, study the phylogeny of VZV strains throughout the world, and understand the evolution of the different clades of VZV. The progress has great impact on the fields of epidemiology, virology and bioinformatics. In this review, the currently available data concerning the geographic distribution and molecular evolution of VZV clades are discussed.","['Jiang LF', 'Gan L', 'Chen JX', 'Wang ML']",2012,28,5,Bing Du Xue Bao,"Jiang LF, et al.

23228438,[Immunisation schedule of the Spanish Association of Paediatrics: 2013 recommendations].,"The Advisory Committee on Vaccines of the Spanish Association of Paediatrics (CAV-AEP) updates the immunisation schedule every year, taking into account epidemiological data as well as evidence on the safety, effectiveness and efficiency of vaccines. The present schedule includes levels of recommendation. We have graded as routine vaccinations those that the CAV-AEP consider all children should receive; as recommended those that fit the profile for universal childhood immunisation and would ideally be given to all children, but that can be prioritised according to the resources available for their public funding; and as risk group vaccinations those that specifically target individuals in situations of risk. Immunisation schedules tend to be dynamic and adaptable to ongoing epidemiological changes. Nevertheless, the achievement of a unified immunisation schedule in all regions of Spain is a top priority for the CAV-AEP. Based on the latest epidemiological trends, CAV-AEP follows the innovations proposed in the last year's schedule, such as the administration of the first dose of the MMR and the varicella vaccines at age 12 months and the second dose at age 2-3 years, as well as the administration of the Tdap vaccine at age 4-6 years, always followed by another dose at 11-14 years of age, preferably at 11-12 years. The CAV-AEP believes that the coverage of vaccination against human papillomavirus in girls aged 11-14 years, preferably at 11-12 years, must increase. It reasserts its recommendation to include vaccination against pneumococcal disease in the routine immunisation schedule. Universal vaccination against varicella in the second year of life is an effective strategy and therefore a desirable objective. Vaccination against rotavirus is recommended in all infants due to the morbidity and elevated healthcare burden of the virus. The Committee stresses the need to vaccinate population groups considered at risk against influenza and hepatitis A. Finally, it emphasizes the need to bring incomplete vaccinations up to date following the catch-up immunisation schedule.","['Moreno-Pérez D', 'Álvarez García FJ', 'Arístegui Fernández J', 'Barrio Corrales F', 'Cilleruelo Ortega MJ', 'Corretger Rauet JM', 'González-Hachero J', 'Hernández-Sampelayo Matos T', 'Merino Moína M', 'Ortigosa Del Castillo L', 'Ruiz-Contreras J', 'Comité Asesor de Vacunas de la Asociación Española de Pediatría, España']",2013,78,1,An Pediatr (Barc),"Moreno-Pérez D, et al.

23221560,Attenuation of the adaptive immune response in rhesus macaques infected with simian varicella virus lacking open reading frame 61.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that causes chickenpox during primary infection and establishes latency in sensory ganglia. Infection of rhesus macaques (RM) with the homologous simian varicella virus (SVV) recapitulates hallmarks of VZV infection. We have shown that an antisense transcript of SVV open reading frame 61 (ORF61), a viral transactivator, was detected most frequently in latently infected RM sensory ganglia. In this study, we compared disease progression, viral replication, immune response, and the establishment of latency following intrabronchial infection with a recombinant SVV lacking ORF61 (SVVΔORF61) to those following infection with wild-type (WT) SVV. Varicella severity and viral latency within sensory ganglia were comparable in RMs infected with SVVΔORF61 and WT SVV. In contrast, viral loads, B and T cell responses, and plasma inflammatory cytokine levels were decreased in RMs infected with SVVΔORF61. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the reduced adaptive immune response, we compared acute SVV gene expression, frequency and proliferation of dendritic cell (DC) subsets, and the expression of innate antiviral genes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. The abundance of SVV transcripts in all kinetic classes was significantly decreased in RMs infected with SVVΔORF61. In addition, we detected a higher frequency and proliferation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in BAL fluid at 3 days postinfection in RMs infected with SVVΔORF61, which was accompanied by a slight increase in type I interferon gene expression. Taken together, our data suggest that ORF61 plays an important role in orchestrating viral gene expression in vivo and interferes with the host antiviral interferon response.","['Meyer C', 'Kerns A', 'Haberthur K', 'Dewane J', 'Walker J', 'Gray W', 'Messaoudi I']",2013,87,4,J Virol,"Meyer C, et al.

23206975,[Early presentation of breakthrough varicella in vaccinated children].,"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of a routine varicella vaccination program for children has achieved a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality due to varicella. However, there is still an incidence of chickenpox in those vaccinated, called ""varicella breakthrough"" (VB). This has led to the inclusion of a 2nd dose vaccination schedule, at an age which could be too late.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study presents 23 cases of children diagnosed with VB (mean age at diagnosis 4.85 years) who had been vaccinated with one dose of varicella vaccine (mean age of vaccination 2.37 years).
RESULTS: The mean time between the vaccine and the disease was 2.48 years, with a median of 2.0 years. VB was diagnosed in 13% of children who had been vaccinated the previous year, and 52% diagnosed in the previous two. Therefore many of these patients had suffered the disease before the recommended time of administration of the second dose of vaccine according to the current vaccine schedules.
CONCLUSIONS: To avoid these vaccine failures, it would be appropriate to bring the two doses of varicella vaccine closer, or even assess the pattern of two consecutive doses.","['Redondo Granado MJ', 'Vizcaíno López I', 'García Saseta P', 'Torres Hinojal C', 'Nieto Sánchez R']",2013,78,5,An Pediatr (Barc),"Redondo Granado MJ, et al.

23205251,Analysis of enzymatic digestion pattern of two open reading frames of Varciella-Zoster genome from Kuwaiti patients using the RFLP technique.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpes virus that usually attacks young children and commonly causes chicken pox (Varicella). Following primary infection, a lifelong latent infection is established. The virus often reactivates during adulthood or senesces to cause shingles (Zoster). Little is known regarding the genotypes of Varicella in Kuwait. The aim of this study was to genotype Varicella samples collected from patients in Kuwait.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 60 cases of chicken pox were typed. The DNA extraction was performed using the commercially available DNA extraction kit. Two sets of oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify the intervening sequences with polymerase chain reaction to identify VZV DNA in clinical samples. The BglI and PstI endonucleases were used to digest. The PCR amplicons for PCR-RFLP typing.
RESULTS: Relatively consistent restriction enzyme digestion profiles for different VZV strains were observed. Limited genetic differences between VZV samples were found. Three VZV strains were identified (A, B and C) with type B representing 86.6%, type A 11.7% and type C being 1.7%. We found that distinct restriction fragment length polymorphism isolates from the same origin or nationality were very similar.
CONCLUSION: Varicella strains with cutting sites for both enzyme PstI and BglI (typeB) were more prevalent. Molecular amplification of viral DNA by PCR and restriction digestion could be used for VZV typing as an alternative method to serological assays.","['Qasem JA', 'Al-Fadhli MA', 'Saraya MA', 'Thomas J']",2012,4,4,Iran J Microbiol,"Qasem JA, et al.

23197907,Clinical features and etiology of adult patients with Fever and rash.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with fever and rash often pose an urgent diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for the clinician. The nonspecificity of many fever and rash syndromes mandates a systemic approach to diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the etiology of fever and rash in 100 adult patients followed-up as in- or outpatients prospectively.
METHODS: All the patients, who presented with rash and fever, were followed-up prospectively and their clinical and laboratory studies were evaluated.
RESULTS: The median age was 35 years (14~79 years); 45 were female and 55 were male. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the etiology: infectious (50%), noninfectious (40%) and undiagnosed (10%). The most common type of rash was maculopapular, and the most common 5 causes were measles, cutaneous drug reactions, varicella, adult-onset Still's disease (ASD) and rickettsial disease. Viral diseases among infectious causes and cutaneous drug reactions, among the noninfectious causes, were determined as the main diseases. The mortality rate was 5% and the reasons of mortality were as follows: toxic epidermal necrolysis (2 patients), ASD (1), staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (1) and graft-versus-host disease (1).
CONCLUSION: Adult patients with fever and rash had a wide differential diagnosis. The most common type of rash was determined as maculopapular, and the most frequent five diseases were measles, drug reactions, chickenpox, ASD and rickettsial infection. Viral diseases among infectious causes and drug reactions among noninfectious causes were determined as the leading etiologies.","['Tabak F', 'Murtezaoglu A', 'Tabak O', 'Ozaras R', 'Mete B', 'Kutlubay Z', 'Mert A', 'Ozturk R']",2012,24,4,Ann Dermatol,"Tabak F, et al.

23190788,Factors associated with receipt of two doses of varicella vaccine among adolescents in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, routine two-dose varicella vaccination for all children was recommended, including a second dose catch-up program for older children and adolescents. Recent studies have shown that a second dose of the vaccine provides incremental protection against varicella disease.
METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in the National Immunization Survey-Teen 2010 combined with publicly available data related to state immunization requirements. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine individual-level and state-level factors associated with receipt of two doses of varicella vaccine among 10,542 adolescents 13 to 17 years of age with no history of varicella.
RESULTS: Overall, 58.1% of adolescents without any history of varicella had received two doses of varicella vaccine. Coverage varied widely among states, ranging from 19.7% in South Dakota to 85.3% in Rhode Island. In the multivariable model, receipt of two doses of varicella vaccine was significantly associated with younger age, higher maternal education level, private health insurance, more frequent health care visits, receipt of both quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate and tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccinations, and residing in a state with two-dose policies for middle school entry. Vaccines for Children program-eligible adolescents were less likely to have received two doses.
CONCLUSION: Two-dose varicella vaccination coverage remained low among adolescents in 2010, despite the universal recommendation. Programs that are aimed specifically at Vaccines for Children program-eligible adolescents, state policies requiring two doses for middle school entry, and broad education and implementation of the adolescent vaccination platform may help to improve varicella vaccination coverage.","['Kawai K', ""O'Brien MA"", 'Conway JH', 'Marshall GS', 'Kuter BJ']",2013,32,5,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Kawai K, et al.

23188098,Incidence and use of resources for chickenpox and herpes zoster in Latin America and the Caribbean--a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox and herpes zoster. More than 90% of varicella cases occur in childhood. The aim of this study was to gather all relevant information on epidemiology and resource use in Latin America and the Caribbean since 2000.
METHODS: Epidemiologic studies published since 2000 with at least 50 cases of varicella or herpes zoster, or at least 10 cases of congenital disease were included. Gray literature was also searched. Outcomes included incidence, admission rate, mortality and case-fatality ratio. Use of resources and both direct and indirect costs associated were extracted.
RESULTS: From the 495 records identified, 23 were included in the meta-analysis to report varicella-zoster virus outcomes and 3 in the herpes zoster analysis. The global pooled varicella incidence in subjects under 15 years of age was 42.9 cases per 1000 individuals per year (95% confidence interval: 26.9-58.9); children under 5 years of age were the most affected. Pooled general admission rate was 3.5 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval: 2.9-4.1) and median hospitalization was 5-9 days. The most common varicella complications reported in studies were skin infections (3-61%), followed by respiratory infections (0-15%) and neurologic problems (1-5%). Direct costs averaged (2011/international dollar [I$]) $2040 per admission (range, I$ 298-5369) and I$70 per clinical visit (range, 11-188 I$).
CONCLUSIONS: Limited information was available on the outcomes studied. Improvements in the surveillance of ambulatory cases are required to obtain a better epidemiologic picture.

23183312,Bioinformatics of varicella-zoster virus: single nucleotide polymorphisms define clades and attenuated vaccine genotypes.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is one of the human herpesviruses. To date, over 40 complete VZV genomes have been sequenced and analyzed. The VZV genome contains around 125,000 base pairs including 70 open reading frames (ORFs). Enumeration of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has determined that the following ORFs are the most variable (in descending order): 62, 22, 29, 28, 37, 21, 54, 31, 1 and 55. ORF 62 is the major immediate early regulatory VZV gene. Further SNP analysis across the entire genome has led to the observation that VZV strains can be broadly grouped into clades within a phylogenetic tree. VZV strains collected in Singapore provided important sequence data for construction of the phylogenetic tree. Currently five VZV clades are recognized; they have been designated clades 1 through 5. Clades 1 and 3 include European/North American strains; clade 2 includes Asian strains, especially from Japan; and clade 5 includes strains from India. Clade 4 includes some strains from Europe, but its geographic origins need further documentation. Within clade 1, five variant viruses have been isolated with a missense mutation in the gE (ORF 68) glycoprotein; these strains have an altered increased cell spread phenotype. Bioinformatics analyses of the attenuated vaccine strains have also been performed, with a subsequent discovery of a stop-codon SNP in ORFO as a likely attenuation determinant. Taken together, these VZV bioinformatics analyses have provided enormous insights into VZV phylogenetics as well as VZV SNPs associated with attenuation.","['Chow VT', 'Tipples GA', 'Grose C']",2013,18,,Infect Genet Evol,"Chow VT, et al.

23174195,How cost effective is universal varicella vaccination in developing countries? A case-study from Colombia.,"OBJECTIVE: Varicella vaccination has not been introduced worldwide, especially in developing countries. The present study assesses the potential epidemiological and economic impact of one-dose and two-dose varicella vaccination schemes in Colombia, a south American upper middle-income country.
METHODS: A decision-tree based model was developed. Varicella cases were estimated based on previous reports of seropositivity within the country. Cost per life-year gained (LYG) was the main outcome measure. Costs from the health care system perspective were expressed in 2008 American dollars. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In Colombia, there would be 700,197 varicella cases in an average year plus 60 yearly deaths without vaccination. It was estimated that health care costs for all cases during 30 years period could be around US $88,734,735 (with discount). Cost per LYG of one-dose vaccination was US $2519 and using a two-dose scheme was US $5728.
CONCLUSION: Vaccinating against varicella in Colombia, an upper middle-income South American country is cost-effective under the assumptions used in this study.

23146530,Disseminated varicella zoster virus infection in adult renal transplant recipients: outcome and risk factors.,"BACKGROUND: Disseminated varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, whether due to primary infection or reactivation, may be life threatening in renal transplant recipients. The aims of this study were to assess the outcome of disseminated VZV infection in renal transplant recipients and to determine potential risk factors for mortality.
METHODS: A search of the English literature from 1985 to 2011 using PUBMED was performed. Reports involving renal transplant recipients younger than 16 years of age were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 56 adult patients presenting with a disseminated cutaneous or visceral VZV infection was included. Seventy percent of cases occurred within 5 years after transplantation, and 89% within 10 years. Visceral complications including disseminated intravascular coagulation occurred in two thirds of patients. Mortality decreased significantly from 47% in the era before 1995 to 17% after 1995 (P = .04). Risk factors for mortality included visceral involvement, use of azathioprine as immunosuppressant, and longer time between transplantation and VZV infection. VZV seropositivity did not influence fatal outcome.
CONCLUSION: Disseminated VZV infection can be life threatening in renal transplant recipients with a global mortality rate of 30%. This rate seems to have decreased since 1995. Seropositive VZV patients with disseminated infection are not protected from fatal outcome.","['Rommelaere M', 'Maréchal C', 'Yombi JC', 'Goffin E', 'Kanaan N']",2012,44,9,Transplant Proc,"Rommelaere M, et al.

23139972,Medically certified sickness absence among health care workers.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the days and spells of sickness absence among males versus females and Saudi nationals versus expatriate employees of King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, and to identify the cause of sickness absence.
METHODS: The cross-sectional, descriptive study comprised 3117 King Khalid University Hospital employees. Records of physician-certified sickness absence from January 1 to June 30, 2009, were obtained from the employee health clinic's register. Absence rate, frequency, duration and severity were assessed and compared between genders and nationalities, and causes were noted. SPSS version 16 and student's t test were used for statistical analyses and comparison.
RESULT: A total of 377 (12.1 %) employees had 416 spells of sickness absence with 639 sick-off days (mean: 1.54 +/- 0.85). The probability of sickness absence was higher among Saudi (OR=1.33) and female (OR=1.39) employees. The association of sickness absence was not found among the absentees with either gender (p= 0.335) or nationality (p = 0.086). Almost all spells of sick-off days were of short duration. Longer spells were mainly due to chicken pox which was found to be more among the expatriates. Heavy absenteeism was found only among the Saudis. The most common causes of sickness absence were acute upper respiratory infection, diseases of musculoskeletal system and the digestive system.
CONCLUSION: The rate, frequency and duration of absence due to sickness in the study were higher among Saudi and female employees. The rate of absence, with passage of time, has increased significantly among Saudi nationals.","['Khawaja RA', 'Sikander R', 'Khawaja AA', 'Jareno RJ', 'Halepota AT']",2012,62,9,J Pak Med Assoc,"Khawaja RA, et al.

23115383,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices for diagnosing breakthrough varicella in the outpatient setting.","OBJECTIVES: We assessed provider knowledge, attitudes, and practices for the management of breakthrough varicella and identified barriers to implementation of laboratory testing and reporting.
METHODS: We surveyed 145 health-care providers (HCPs) from 30 pediatric practices in Philadelphia who did not have a history of laboratory testing for breakthrough varicella. The self-administered survey instrument collected information on clinicians' practices for management of children presenting with rash, infection-control strategies, reporting to public health agencies, and laboratory testing.
RESULTS: Among the 144 HCPs who completed the survey, 73 (51%) had practiced for more than 10 years. While 115 HCPs (80%) would elect to evaluate a child with rash in the office, only 19 (13%) would submit diagnostics. When patients had a known recent exposure to varicella, 84 HCPs (58%) would use laboratory tests: 40% would use direct fluorescent antibody staining on a specimen from a cutaneous lesion, 24% would use polymerase chain reaction on a lesion specimen, 21% would use acute and convalescent serology, and 10% would use other tests. While waiting for test results, 82 HCPs (57%) would advise that the child be kept at home, 39 (27%) would notify the local health department, and 33 (23%) would inform the school nurse.
CONCLUSION: As varicella becomes increasingly uncommon, laboratory confirmation becomes more critical for appropriate diagnosis, similar to poliomyelitis and measles. Our findings suggest that HCPs need further education regarding laboratory confirmation, containment, and reporting of breakthrough varicella.","['Daskalaki I', 'Viner KM', 'Perella D', 'Newbern EC', 'Johnson CC', 'Watson BM']",2012,127,6,Public Health Rep,"Daskalaki I, et al.

23108354,Vaccine effectiveness evaluation during a varicella outbreak among children of primary schools and day-care centers in a region which adopted UMV.,"This study describes an outbreak of varicella, in a small town in the region of Puglia, Southern Italy, in the period between February-March 2011. This outbreak presented the opportunity to assess varicella vaccine effectiveness and its determinants. The outbreak occurred in a small community in Puglia; parents of the children attending the schools of the community were contacted by telephone and information was gathered on current disease and varicella history. Varicella vaccination history was verified through the immunization registry of the Local Health Unit. Before the outbreak, immunization coverage was 86.6% of children attending preschool and 51.9% of children attending elementary school. In day care center where the outbreak was happened, the attack rate in vaccinated individuals was 32.1% and 80% in susceptible unvaccinated individuals. VE is therefore estimated as 59.9% (95% CI = 48.3-69.8). In the elementary school the VE can be calculated as 69.2% (95% CI = 50.5-88.1), since the attack rate in unvaccinated children was of 23.1% and in vaccinated of 7.1. The time between vaccination and the onset of the epidemic appears higher in children with a vaccine failure. The results of this study highlight the need for a reflection on the desirability of adopting a shorter schedule in Italy, with a minimum 1 mo interval between MMRV doses.","['Tafuri S', 'Martinelli D', 'Prato R', 'Germinario C']",2013,9,1,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Tafuri S, et al.

23101205,[Chickenpox in Poland in 2010].,"INTRODUCTION: Chickenpox is a common childhood disease. It occurs sporadically in persons over the age of 15. Regardless of the fact that chickenpox is considered to be a disease of benign course, it may cause complications of different severity levels and with necessity of hospitalization. Since 2004, a high incidence of chickenpox is observed in Poland.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present article was to analyze the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2010 with its comparison to the situation observed in the previous years.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The epidemiological situation ofchickenpox in Poland in 2010 was analyzed on the basis of aggregated data on infectious diseases published in the annual bulletins, i.e.: ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2010"" (Czarkowski MP. et al., Warsaw, NIPH-NIH, Chief Sanitary Inspectorate) and ""Vaccinations in Poland in 2010"" (Czarkowski MP. et al., Warsaw, NIPH-NIH, Chief Sanitary Inspectorate). In the present article the authors also referred to the Polish Immunization Programme for 2010 (annex to the statement of the Chief Sanitary Inspector of 22 October 2009). The data on the number of hospitalized persons and complications due to the chickenpox was derived from the Department - Centre for Monitoring and Analyses of Population Health Status and Health Care System (NIPH-NIH).
RESULTS: In 2010, 183 446 cases of chickenpox were reported. The highest number of chickenpox cases was registered in mazowieckie voivodeship, the lowest--in podlaskie voivodeship. The incidence was estimated at 480.04 per 100 000 population and was significantly higher than the incidence observed in 2009 (367.2). The highest chickenpox incidence, which amounted to 4298.4 per 100 000, was reported in children aged 5-9 years. The highest number ofchickenpox cases (the peak) was reported in the period from January to June. The lowest number of cases was registered in September. The chickenpox incidence was higher in men than women and in the inhabitans of villages (498.6 per 100 000) than in persons residing in towns (468.8). The highest incidence was observed in towns with the number of inhabitants ranging from 55 to 99 thousands (532.2 per 100 000), while the lowest incidence was reported in towns over 100 thousand inhabitants (439.1 per 100 000). Overall, 1007 persons were hospitalized due to the chickenpox. A total of 31 540 persons were vaccinated, of whom 30 513 persons belonged to the age group 0-19 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Since 2004, an increase in the number of reported chickenpox cases is observed in Poland. It is a consequence of improvement in chickenpox registration.","['Głuchowska M', 'Paradowska-Stankiewicz I']",2012,66,2,Przegl Epidemiol,Głuchowska M and Paradowska-Stankiewicz I.

23100246,Characterizing vaccine-associated risks using cubic smoothing splines.,"Estimating risks associated with the use of childhood vaccines is challenging. The authors propose a new approach for studying short-term vaccine-related risks. The method uses a cubic smoothing spline to flexibly estimate the daily risk of an event after vaccination. The predicted incidence rates from the spline regression are then compared with the expected rates under a log-linear trend that excludes the days surrounding vaccination. The 2 models are then used to estimate the excess cumulative incidence attributable to the vaccination during the 42-day period after vaccination. Confidence intervals are obtained using a model-based bootstrap procedure. The method is applied to a study of known effects (positive controls) and expected noneffects (negative controls) of the measles, mumps, and rubella and measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines among children who are 1 year of age. The splines revealed well-resolved spikes in fever, rash, and adenopathy diagnoses, with the maximum incidence occurring between 9 and 11 days after vaccination. For the negative control outcomes, the spline model yielded a predicted incidence more consistent with the modeled day-specific risks, although there was evidence of increased risk of diagnoses of congenital malformations after vaccination, possibly because of a ""provider visit effect."" The proposed approach may be useful for vaccine safety surveillance.","['Brookhart MA', 'Walker AM', 'Lu Y', 'Polakowski L', 'Li J', 'Paeglow C', 'Puenpatom T', 'Izurieta H', 'Daniel GW']",2012,176,10,Am J Epidemiol,"Brookhart MA, et al.

23076951,Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster or, as it is commonly called, 'shingles' is a neurocutaneous disease characterised by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox, which is latent in the dorsal spinal ganglia when immunity to VZV declines. It is an extremely painful condition which can often last for many weeks or months, impairing the patient's quality of life. The natural aging process is associated with a reduction of cellular immunity which predisposes to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of VZV activates specific T cell production, therefore avoiding viral reactivation. A herpes zoster vaccine with an active virus has been approved for clinical use among older adults by the Food and Drug Administration and has been tested in large populations.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following sources for relevant studies: CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7, MEDLINE (1948 to July week 1, 2012), EMBASE (2010 to July 2012), LILACS (1982 to July 2012) and CINAHL (1981 to July 2012). We also reviewed reference lists of identified trials and reviews for additional studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine with placebo or no vaccine, to prevent herpes zoster in older adults (mean age > 60 years).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently collected and analysed data using a data extraction form. They also carried out an assessment of risk of bias.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified eight RCTs with a total of 52,269 participants. Three studies were classified at low risk of bias. The main outcomes on effectiveness and safety were extracted from one clinical trial with a low risk of bias. Four studies compared zoster vaccine versus placebo; one study compared high-potency zoster vaccine versus low-potency zoster vaccine; one study compared refrigerated zoster vaccine versus frozen zoster vaccine; one study compared live zoster vaccine versus inactivated zoster vaccine and one study compared zoster vaccine versus pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (pneumo 23).Confirmed cases of herpes zoster were less frequent in patients who received the vaccine than in those who received a placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56), with a risk difference (RD) of 2%, and number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 50. Analyses according to age groups indicated a greater benefit in participants aged 60 to 69 years, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.45) and in participants aged 70 years and over, RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.75). Vaccine-related systemic adverse effects were more frequent in the vaccinated group (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.57, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 100). The pooled data risk ratio for adverse effects for participants with one or more inoculation site adverse effect was RR 4.51 (95% CI 2.35 to 8.68), and the NNTH was 2.8 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.4). Side effects were more frequent in younger (60 to 69 years) than in older (70 years and over) participants.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease. Although vaccine benefits are larger in the younger age group (60 to 69 years), this is also the age group with more adverse events. In general, zoster vaccine is well tolerated; it produces few systemic adverse events and injection site adverse effects of mild to moderate intensity.","['Gagliardi AM', 'Gomes Silva BN', 'Torloni MR', 'Soares BG']",2012,10,,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Gagliardi AM, et al.

23072059,[TaqMan fluorescent probe-based real-time PCR assay for detection of varicella-zoster virus].,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella-zoster virus (HHV-3) is spread by the respiratory route and disseminates to lymph nodes and then via lymph back to the skin, resulting with the rash of chickenpox. Like other alpha-herpesviruses, HHV-3 infects the neurons of the dorsal root ganglia, where it causes lifelong latency. Virus reactivation causes episode of herpes zoster (shingles). During severe HHV-3 infections molecular methods, such as real-time PCR (qPCR) assay, are recognized as a method-of-choice for detecting viral DNA in clinical specimens. The aim of this study was to develop the qPCR assay for detection and quantification of varicella-zoster virus DNA in different clinical samples, using specific primers targeting a HHV-3 DNA ORF62 gene and a fluorescent TaqMan probe.
METHODS: The analytical sensitivity of assay was tested using serial dilutions of viral DNA in range between 100 and 3 125 000 copies/ml. Limit of detection (LOD) was calculated using probit analysis, and was determined as 750 copies/ml. In further studies 18 clinical samples (sera, whole blood, skin swabs), taken from a small group of 5 children with symptoms of chickenpox were tested for the presence of varicella-zoster virus DNA, using LightCycler 2.0 system.
RESULTS: Described in-house qPCR method detected viral DNA in all examined specimens. Detected viral load was between 5750 copies/ml for sera samples and 27 300 000 copies/ ml for skin swabs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this work showed that developed real-time PCR assay based on TaqMan probe was very reliable and valuable for detection and quantification of varicella-zoster virus DNA in different clinical samples. The high level of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and rapidity provided by the developed method are favorable for its use for the detection of HHV-3 DNA in laboratory practice.","['Kierat S', 'Leś K', 'Przybylski M', 'Dzieciatkowski T', 'Młynarczyk G']",2012,64,2,Med Dosw Mikrobiol,"Kierat S, et al.

23069796,COMMENTARY: Significantly less anti-gC antibody detectable in sera collected after varicella vaccination than after the disease varicella.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the first human herpesvirus to be attenuated and then approved in 1995 as a live vaccine for children. Within a few years after its administration in the United States, small outbreaks of breakthrough varicella were observed in vaccinees. Several risk factors were determined. But now a new investigation suggests another risk factor, namely, a deficiency in antibody responses to a specific individual VZV glycoprotein called gC (ORF14; gpV) in the vaccinees. Antibody concentrations to 5 VZV protein antigens were measured in children who had either wild type varicella or varicella vaccination. These proteins included two major glycoproteins called gE (ORF68; gpI) and gC (ORF14), both constituents of the viral envelope and therefore potentially important targets of the adaptive immune response. Of particular interest, the serum antibody responses to VZV gC antigen were significantly lower in vaccinees than in children who had wild type varicella. In contrast, the serum antibody responses to VZV gE antigen were comparable in both groups. These data implied that relatively little gC antigen was produced in children who were immunized. Since abundant gC protein is produced in skin vesicles during wild type varicella, the lack of a vesicular rash after vaccination may limit the amounts of some viral antigens required for an optimal antibody response.","['Grose C', 'Juhn Y']",2012,31,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,Grose C and Juhn Y.

23044005,Does methotrexate increase the risk of varicella or herpes zoster infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? A systematic literature review.,"OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX) has become the foundation disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) for RA. However, concern exists regarding its possible association with infectious complications including varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes zoster (HZ). Furthermore, no consensus exists regarding pre-MTX VZV screening or the use of VZV vaccine.
METHODS: We undertook systematic literature review (SLR) investigating the relationship between the use of MTX in patients with RA and VZV and HZ infection. Additionally, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, HPA, the CDC, Rheumatology societies and WHO web sites and publications were consulted.
RESULTS: Thirty-five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria comprising 29 observational studies and 6 case reports. The case reports and 13 observation studies considered the association between MTX and HZ. Three of the observational studies reported a positive association although in 5 cases, patients were concurrently treated with prednisolone. Five studies concluded that there was no association between HZ and MTX. Three studies comparing the infection rates of MTX with other RA therapies found that MTX did not result in higher HZ infection rates. Three studies examining the association between HZ and MTX treatment duration failed to show a link.
CONCLUSIONS: No evidence exists to support an association between MTX and VZV infection in RA patients and the data regarding the role of MTX in HZ development is conflicting. The role of pre-MTX VZV screening is controversial and, as it may delay initiation of RA treatment, we suggest against VZV screening in this context.","['Zhang N', 'Wilkinson S', 'Riaz M', 'Östör AJ', 'Nisar MK']",2012,30,6,Clin Exp Rheumatol,"Zhang N, et al.

23034171,Reconstitution of protective immune responses against cytomegalovirus and varicella zoster virus does not require disease development in pediatric recipients of umbilical cord blood transplantation.,"CMV and varicella zoster virus (VZV) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality following umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). However, the kinetics of reconstitution and protective potential of antiviral cell-mediated immune responses following UCBT remain poorly characterized. In this study, the reconstitution of CMV- and VZV-specific T cell responses was assessed using IFN-γ ELISPOT in 28 children who underwent UCBT to treat hematological or inherited disorders. Barely detectable in the first 3 mo posttransplantation, CMV- and VZV-specific T cell responses were observed in 30.4% and 40.3% of study subjects after 36 mo of follow-up. Four of five CMV-seropositive subjects developed detectable levels of circulating CMV DNA (DNAemia), and 5 of 17 VZV-seropositive patients experienced herpes zoster during the posttransplant period. Four CMV-seronegative subjects developed IFN-γ responses against CMV, and four subjects developed a VZV-specific IFN-γ response without clinical signs of infection. No CMV- or VZV-related events were observed in study subjects following the development of CMV- or VZV-specific responses > 150 spot-forming units/10(6) PBMCs, consistent with T cell-mediated protection. Finally, famciclovir prophylaxis did not strictly prevent the reconstitution of the VZV-specific T cell repertoire, because the frequency of T cells producing IFN-γ in response to VZV Ags reached levels consistent with protection in two nonzoster subjects. Monitoring of CMV- and VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity could inform immunocompetence and guide the initiation and cessation of antiherpetic prophylaxis in UCBT recipients.","['Merindol N', 'Salem Fourati I', 'Brito RM', 'Grenier AJ', 'Charrier E', 'Cordeiro P', 'Caty M', 'Mezziani S', 'Malette B', 'Duval M', 'Alfieri C', 'Ovetchkine P', 'Le Deist F', 'Soudeyns H']",2012,189,10,J Immunol,"Merindol N, et al.

The donor developed varicella infection shortly after blood donation despite vaccination. Varicella-zoster virus DNA was detected in her fresh-frozen plasma before the blood components were issued for clinical transfusion. The report indicates the importance of donors' education and awareness of their obligation to report any symptoms developed shortly after blood donation in order to further secure blood safety.","['Chan HM', 'Ho PL', 'Chan KH', 'Lin CK', 'Lee CK']",2013,104,3,Vox Sang,"Chan HM, et al.

22994936,Varicella-zoster immunization in pediatric liver transplant recipients: safe and immunogenic.,"Varicella can have a severe course in immunosuppressed patients. Although prevention is fundamental, live-attenuated varicella-zoster (VZV) vaccine is not currently recommended in transplant recipients. Our aims were to (1) evaluate VZV immunity in pediatric liver transplant (LT) recipients; (2) immunize (two doses) seronegative patients post-LT; (3) monitor vaccine safety, (4) assess B and T cell vaccine responses. All patients followed at the Swiss National Pediatric LT Center were approached and 77/79 (97.5%) were enrolled (median age 7.8 years). Vaccine safety was monitored by standardized diary cards and phone calls. VZV-specific serology and CD4(+) T cells were assessed before and after immunization. Thirty-nine patients (51.1%) were seronegative including 14 children immunized pre-LT. Thirty-six of 39 seronegative patients were immunized post-LT (median 3.0 years post LT). Local (54.8%) and systemic (64.5%) reactions were mild and transient. The frequency of VZV-specific CD4(+) T cells and antibody titers increased significantly (respectively from 0.085% to 0.16%, p = 0.04 and 21.0 to 1134.5 IU/L, p < 0.001). All children reached seroprotective titers and 31/32 (97%) patients assessed remained seroprotected at follow-up (median 1.7 years). No breakthrough disease was reported during follow-up (median 4.1 years). Thereby, VZV vaccine appears to be safe, immunogenic and provide protection against disease in pediatric LT patients.","['Posfay-Barbe KM', 'Pittet LF', 'Sottas C', 'Grillet S', 'Wildhaber BE', 'Rodriguez M', 'Kaiser L', 'Belli DC', 'McLin VA', 'Siegrist CA']",2012,12,11,Am J Transplant,"Posfay-Barbe KM, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of using the chemical reconstruction of skin scar technique for the treatment of atrophic facial chickenpox scars.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred patients (mean age 23 years; Fitzpatrick skin types II-IV) were treated with focal chemical peeling with 70% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for a maximum of six sessions. Improvement rate, frequency of adverse events and patient satisfaction were assessed.
RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-three peeling sessions in 100 consecutive patients were performed. Final assessment at 12-week follow-up visit after the last treatment revealed improvement in 95% of patients: mild improvement in 12 cases, moderate improvement in 42 cases, and marked improvement in 41 cases. The appearance of scars did not change in five patients. Seventy-nine patients expressed moderate to high satisfaction with the results. Post-treatment side effects were mild and transient, resolving gradually within the study period.
CONCLUSION: Focal peeling with high-concentration TCA appears to be a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of atrophic facial chickenpox scars.","['Barikbin B', 'Saadat N', 'Akbari Z', 'Yousefi M', 'Toossi P']",2012,38,10,Dermatol Surg,"Barikbin B, et al.

22982893,Chickenpox-related pulmonary granulomas in immunocompetent adults: clinicopathologic and molecular features of an underrated occurrence.,"Pulmonary granulomas represent a common inflammatory reaction to several lung infective or noninfective diseases. However, little is known about the histology and clinical presentation of chickenpox-related granulomas in immunocompetent subjects. We collected a series of 8 adult patients (mean age, 40 y; range, 33 to 53 y) with several bilateral pulmonary granulomas incidentally discovered after imaging studies. All patients were asymptomatic and had experienced a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection as adults but were clinically suspected to have a metastatic neoplasm of unknown origin. Chest computed tomography scan revealed numerous, tiny (few millimeters to 1 cm in size) nodules randomly dispersed through the lungs. Positron emission tomography scan performed in 4 patients was negative. All patients underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical resection and were still alive and well. At histology, granulomas consisted of well-defined, rounded, small nodules centered by a deeply eosinophilic, acellular necrosis rimmed by lamellar dense collagen and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with or without multinucleated giant cells. Chickenpox-related granulomas were included in the differential diagnosis along with several other granulomatous diseases. Polymerase chain reaction-based molecular analysis for VZV performed on paraffin sections detected VZV DNA in all 8 cases. By contrast, 85 cases of pulmonary granulomas of different etiologies were simultaneously studied by molecular analysis with negative results. Pathologists should be familiar with the peculiar morphologic appearance of chickenpox-related granulomas. A careful search for a history of VZV infection in adulthood and molecular studies may be very helpful in confirming the diagnosis.","['Rossi G', 'Cavazza A', 'Gennari W', 'Marchioni A', 'Graziano P', 'Caminati A', 'Mengoli MC', 'Magnani R', 'Colby TV']",2012,36,10,Am J Surg Pathol,"Rossi G, et al.

We assessed knowledge regarding MMRV and febrile seizures, intended practices, and factors influencing the decision to recommend MMRV.
METHODS: National survey administered 10/2008-1/2009 of US pediatricians (Peds) and family physicians (FP).
RESULTS: Response rate was 73% (620/849). Twenty-nine percent of Peds and 74% of FP (p<0.001) were unaware of increased febrile seizure risk after MMRV. After reading an informational statement, 20% of Peds and 7% of FP (p<0.001) would recommend MMRV to a healthy 12-15-month-old child. The factor most frequently reported as ""very important"" in the decision to recommend MMRV or MMR+V was ACIP/AAFP/AAP recommendations (pediatricians, 77%, family physicians, 73%, p=0.08).

However, currently HZ immunization is sub-optimal. We examined awareness of HZ and of the HZ vaccine. Information was gathered via a one-page survey given to patients ≥ 50 years of age presenting at the dermatology clinic. From the surveyed population of 1000 individuals, the HZ vaccination rate was 11.9 percent. Vaccination coverage was highest for the ≥ 70 age group (18.3%), followed by age groups 60-69 (8.9%) and 50-59 (1.4%). Individuals with female gender, older age (≥ 70 years), higher level of education (college and beyond), retired employment status, memory of chickenpox, knowledge of shingles, and history of shingles and influenza vaccination in the past year all were more likely to have heard of and have received the HZ vaccine (except female gender, education level, and awareness of shingles). Our study suggests lack of awareness to be a significant factor in non-immunization with zoster vaccine. Targeting adults in younger age groups and minorities would be beneficial towards increasing zoster vaccine awareness and thus preventing herpes zoster and its many complications.","['Javed S', 'Javed F', 'Mays RM', 'Tyring SK']",2012,18,8,Dermatol Online J,"Javed S, et al.

They also estimated the vaccination coverage in this population.
METHOD: A questionnaire link was sent by to 1008 family physicians of the French Inserm Sentinel network. Each family physician had to include the last teenager aged 12 to 18 years seen in consultation, with no or uncertain history of clinical varicella.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one family physicians agreed to participate and included one patient (participation rate=14%) between 4th November 2010 and 4th January 2011. One hundred and thirty-three questionnaires out of 141 (94%) were analyzed. Three patients were vaccinated and 127 were not, giving a weak vaccination coverage in the investigated population at 2%. Eighty-nine family physicians (70%) did not know about the recommendation, and 90 (71%) declared that they had no intention to vaccinate their patient against varicella.
CONCLUSION: Guidelines on varicella vaccination of non-immune teenagers are poorly followed and accepted by family physicians.

Symptomatic therapy is usually adequate for chickenpox, but in some cases it requires combinations of antiviral drugs and antibiotics.
OBJECTIVES: To present our expirience with chickenpox therapy in children and adult patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Study included 120 randomly chosen patients, 60 adults and 60 children, with confirmed chickenpox infection, hospitalised at Clinic for infectious diseases in Sarajevo. Observed period was 1st January 2005. to 30th June 2011. We compared used therapy and outcome of disease.
RESULTS: We had 333 patients with confirmed chickenpox in mentioned period. Male sex prevailed. Antiviral (acyclovir) therapy was initiated in 8(13.5%) adults and 16(27%) children. Most frequently used antibiotic was Co-Amoxiclav in a group of adults and Ceftriaxone in a group of children.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We use different terapeutical approaches to chickenpox according to the severity of the clinical picture and the existence of underlying diseases. Symptomatic treatment is indicated in all immunocompetent patients with no signs of complications. Use of corticosteroids remains open dillemma.

METHODS: We performed a prospective and controlled study on a group of 54 SLE patients that were chosen at random to be or not to be vaccinated (28 were vaccinated and 26 were not). Twenty-eight healthy controls, of matching age and sex were also vaccinated. All were submitted to a questionnaire, physical evaluation and laboratory assays: lymphocyte immune-phenotyping by flow cytometry, plasma varicella zoster virus (VZV) serology by ELISA and in vitro interferon gamma (IFNγ) production by T-cells after stimulus with VZV antigen. They were evaluated before vaccination and at 30, 45, 180 and 360 days afterwards.
RESULTS: We did not observe any differences in the frequency of adverse events in both vaccinated groups. At study entry, all individuals were seropositive for VZV antibodies. The serum VZV antibody titres similarly increased after vaccination. The frequency of flares and the SLEDAI score were also similar among the patients. Thirty days after vaccination the production of IFNγ specific to VZV was lower in the SLE group compared to healthy controls. In the follow-up we observed 4 cases of herpes zoster in the SLE unvaccinated group, but no zoster in the vaccinated group.
CONCLUSIONS: The varicella vaccine was well tolerated in SLE group, who had pre-existing immunity to varicella. The varicella vaccine immunogenicity measurement by serum antibody titres was appropriate.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: All of the medical students were eligible for participation after informed consents. Immunization history against varicella, mumps, measles, rubella (MMR) and hepatitis B were obtained from a questionnaire. A blood sample was obtained from each student for IgG antibody against VZV by ELISA. Medical students with an uncertain history or no documentation of hepatitis B vaccination were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBcIgG by ELISA.
RESULTS: There were 383 medical students enrolled. The mean age at enrollment was 21.6 years (median 21.4 years; range 18-25.8 years). Of 383 medical students, 372 (97.2%) had documents of receiving MMR immunizations. The blood samples were obtained from 374 of 383 (97.6%) medical students to identify the immunity against varicella zoster virus (VZV) and the seroprevalence rate was 92%. Using VZVIgG antibody detection as a standard test, history of experience of varicella disease provided positive predictive value of 99.3% (148/149). Of 383 medical students, 277 (72.3%) were tested for hepatitis B markers and 243 (87.7%) students showed negative results. The prevalence of HBsAg carriers was 0.01% (4/383).

Because national surveillance data were not adequate for monitoring the impact of varicella vaccine when it became available in the United States, active surveillance for varicella was established in sentinel sites in 1995 (1,2). With declines in varicella incidence after 1 dose of varicella vaccine was added to the routine childhood vaccination schedule in 1996 (3) and a second dose was recommended in 2006 (4), the number of cases of varicella in the active surveillance sites became insufficient to monitor further impact of vaccination. CDC evaluated varicella surveillance data reported via the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) during 2000-2010 to determine whether these data might now be adequate for monitoring vaccination impact. By 2010, a total of 39 states required reporting of varicella cases, 38 states were conducting passive case-based surveillance, and 31 met CDC's ad hoc criteria for adequate and consistent reporting. Varicella incidence in the states that met these criteria declined 79% overall, from 43 per 100,000 population in 2000 to nine in 2010. While 1 dose of varicella vaccine was recommended, incidence declined 43% during 2000-2005, and after a second dose was added to the routine childhood schedule, incidence declined 72% during 2006-2010. State varicella surveillance data reported to CDC through NNDSS are now adequate for monitoring trends in varicella incidence, but continued strengthening of the surveillance system and participation of all states is needed.",['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'],2012,61,32,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

22894966,"Varicella vaccine uptake in Shandong Province, China.","Varicella vaccine has been licensed in China for decade to be used as single dose in children aged ≥ 12 mo of age in private sector. Little data were available on varicella uptake to date in China yet. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shandong Province in May 2011 to examine varicella vaccination coverage among children aged 16-40 mo and examine factors associated with varicella vaccine uptake. The overall coverage among children eligible for varicella vaccine was 62% (range 16.7-94.7% by county), much lower than the coverage of the eight vaccines included in the national immunization program (all above 97%). Though proximity to immunization services (< 5 km) was linked with higher vaccine uptake (62.6 vs. 37.4%, p = 0.02), county-level economic development (77.8, 61.0 and 47.1% for developed, sub-developed and developing regions, respectively, p < 0.001) played an even more important role in varicella vaccination. Moreover, there was little variation in coverage of vaccines included in the national immunization program along with county-level economic development. Even though varicella vaccine uptake is relatively high for use on a private basis, the vaccination coverage is not high enough to prevent epidemiology shift to adolescents and adults who are more prone to develop severe outcomes to varicella. Further enhancement on varicella vaccination coverage is necessary and inclusion to national immunization program seems to be a promising option for achieving and maintaining high coverage.","['Xu A', 'Xu Q', 'Fang X', 'Bialek S', 'Wang C']",2012,8,9,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Xu A, et al.

22890288,Live (vaccines) from New York.,"Over 40 000 hematopoietic cell transplantations (HCT) are performed worldwide each year, increasing the number of transplant survivors returning to school, the work place and overseas travel. Outbreaks of measles and mumps in immunocompetent individuals and the increased morbidity associated with primary varicella and shingles in older individuals highlight the need for effective vaccination of these vulnerable patients. In current post-HCT vaccination guidelines, only the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and the live-attenuated varicella vaccine (LAVV) designed to prevent primary varicella in varicella zoster seronegative individuals are permissible post HCT and only in select patient groups. All other vaccines, including the shingles vaccines, are contraindicated post HCT. Current data, primarily in pediatric HCT recipients, demonstrate a 60-70% response following a single MMR or LAVV. A two-dose schedule increases the seroconversion rate following these vaccines. This review will highlight published studies on the immunogenicity of MMR and the LAVV, areas in which data on these vaccines are lacking, the criteria for their use in patients transplanted at our center and potential studies to answer questions posed by the growing number of transplant survivors and their physicians on how to safely administer live-attenuated viral vaccines.","['Forlenza CJ', 'Small TN']",2013,48,6,Bone Marrow Transplant,Forlenza CJ and Small TN.

22889542,Neurovirulence of varicella and the live attenuated varicella vaccine virus.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic herpesvirus, which can cause a variety of complications during varicella infections. These range from meningoencephalitis to polyneuritis to retinitis. After primary VZV infection, VZV enters the dorsal root ganglia in a latent state. Reactivation from latency leads to zoster. The velocity of VZV is 13 cm per day, as the virus travels from ganglion to skin. The live attenuated varicella vaccine virus is markedly less neurovirulent than the wild-type virus. Nevertheless, a few cases of herpes zoster due to the vaccine virus have been documented. Usually, herpes zoster occurs in the same arm as the vaccination, often 3 or more years after vaccination. Thus, herpes zoster in a vaccinee often represents a reactivation of vaccine virus that was carried to the cervical dorsal root ganglia from a site of local replication in the arm. Finally, the role of autophagy during VZV infection is discussed. Autophagosome formation is a prominent feature in the skin vesicles during both varicella and herpes zoster. Therefore, autophagy is one of the innate immune mechanisms associated with VZV infection in humans.","['Horien C', 'Grose C']",2012,19,3,Semin Pediatr Neurol,Horien C and Grose C.

In buffer solution, carbamate and ester prodrugs were found to be chemically stable. Most prodrugs containing a dipeptidyl linker efficiently converted into the BCNA parent drug. In contrast, the Val-Pro alkyldiamino prodrugs converted predominantly into their alkyldiamino prodrug intermediates in the presence of CD26 and human serum. A marked increase in water solubility was observed for all prodrugs. In contrast to the parent compound, a tetrapeptide prodrug containing the Val-Val dipeptide as a self-cleavage spacer released substantial amounts of the BCNA parent drug at the basolateral side of Caco-2 cell cultures and exhibited 15- to 20-fold increased bioavailability in mice relative to the poorly bioavailable parent compound.","['Diez-Torrubia A', 'Cabrera S', 'De Meester I', 'Camarasa MJ', 'Balzarini J', 'Velázquez S']",2012,7,9,ChemMedChem,"Diez-Torrubia A, et al.

22884663,Challenges in confirming a varicella outbreak in the two-dose vaccine era.,"BACKGROUND: A second dose of varicella vaccine was recommended for U.S. children in 2006. We investigated a suspected varicella outbreak in School District X, Texas to determine 2-dose varicella vaccine effectiveness (VE).
METHODS: A varicella case was defined as an illness with maculopapulovesicular rash without other explanation with onset during April 1-June 10, 2011, in a School District X student. We conducted a retrospective cohort in the two schools with the majority of cases. Lesion, saliva, and environmental specimens were collected for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) PCR testing. VE was calculated using historic attack rates among unvaccinated.
RESULTS: In School District X, 82 varicella cases were reported, including 60 from Schools A and B. All cases were mild, with a median of 14 lesions. All 10 clinical specimens and 58 environmental samples tested negative for VZV. Two-dose varicella vaccination coverage was 66.4% in Schools A and B. Varicella VE in affected classrooms was 80.9% (95% CI: 67.2-88.9) among 1-dose vaccinees and 94.7% (95% CI: 89.2-97.4) among 2-dose vaccinees in School A, with a second dose incremental VE of 72.1% (95% CI: 39.0-87.3). Varicella VE among School B students did not differ significantly by dose (80.1% vs. 84.2% among 1-dose and 2-dose vaccinees, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Laboratory testing could not confirm varicella as the etiology of this outbreak; clinical and epidemiologic data suggests varicella as the likely cause. Better diagnostics are needed for diagnosis of varicella in vaccinated individuals so that appropriate outbreak control measures can be implemented.","['Mahamud A', 'Wiseman R', 'Grytdal S', 'Basham C', 'Asghar J', 'Dang T', 'Leung J', 'Lopez A', 'Schmid DS', 'Bialek SR']",2012,30,48,Vaccine,"Mahamud A, et al.

22882129,Dermal hypersensitivity reaction: a PCR-confirmed pattern of herpetic dermatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Herpetic dermatitis due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) can present with similar clinical and histopathologic features. Further confounding matters, viral cytopathic changes are not always observed in biopsy specimens. Therefore, use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis can play an integral role in the definitive diagnosis of herpetic dermatitis and in the distinction of HSV-1/HSV-2 from VZV.
METHODS: Forty patients with skin biopsies (2004-2011) had PCR analysis performed to detect HSV-1/2 or VZV. Patient demographics, clinical impression and histopathologic characteristics were reviewed and correlated with PCR findings.
RESULTS: Overall, there was complete correlation between clinical impression, histopathology and PCR results in 21 of 40 cases. In 19 cases, clinical impression and histopathology were discrepant and in 15 of these cases PCR confirmed HSV or VZV infection. We also describe 3 cases of herpetic dermatitis without viral change that histopathologically demonstrate the pattern of a dermal hypersensitivity reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that routine use of PCR for definitive diagnosis of herpetic dermatitis should be considered when there is a clinical suspicion of herpes virus infection, even when there is a lack of specific histopathologic findings. Additionally, a dermal hypersensitivity reaction should be recognized as one histopathologic manifestation of herpes incognito.","['Kinonen CL', 'Gleason BC', 'Thomas AB', 'Kaul KL', 'Cibull TL']",2012,39,10,J Cutan Pathol,"Kinonen CL, et al.

METHODS: In a phase I/II, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study, older adults (50-70 years) received 2 doses 2 months apart of an adjuvanted recombinant glycoprotein E vaccine (HZ/su; n = 45), a live attenuated Oka strain VZV vaccine (OKA; n = 45), or HZ/su and OKA administered concomitantly (n = 45). To evaluate safety prior to administration in older adults, young adults (18-30 years) were vaccinated with 2 doses 2 months apart of HZ/su (n = 10) or OKA (n = 10). Safety and immunogenicity were assessed up to 42 months for older adults immunized with HZ/su and up to 12 months for all others.
RESULTS: Few grade 3 events and no severe adverse events were reported. Fatigue, myalgia, headache, and injection site pain were the most common solicited reactions for HZ/su and occurred more frequently than with OKA. CD4(+) T-cell and humoral immune responses were much higher with HZ/su than with OKA and remained elevated until 42 months. Addition of OKA to HZ/su did not increase immunogenicity.

22867721,The epidemiology and risk factors for breakthrough varicella in Beijing Fengtai district.,"Using data from the Immunization Information System (IIS) and the Infectious Disease Reporting System (IDRS), we have described the epidemiology and analyzed the risk factors for breakthrough varicella in the Fengtai district of Beijing, China. From 2008 to 2011 the breakthrough varicella infection rate (BVR) was 0.65%, 0.85%, 1.08% and 1.56% respectively, thus demonstrating a distinct increasing tendency (P<0.001). We also compared the incidence of varicella-related illnesses between the breakthrough varicella cases and unvaccinated cases, and found that the severity of illness in the breakthrough cases was milder than that of unvaccinated cases. Moderate-to-severe cases (P=0.008, OR=0.676, 95% CI=0.505-0.904) were differently distributed in the breakthrough varicella cases and unvaccinated cases. In this study, we demonstrated that floating status (P=0.031, OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.06-3.62), contact history (P<0.001, OR=2.67, 95% CI=1.59-4.69), time since vaccination (P=0.006, OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.14-2.21), age at vaccination (P=0.010, OR=0.59, 95% CI=0.39-0.88) and combined vaccination (P=0.026, OR=3.99, 95% CI=1.18-13.54) were associated with the occurrence of breakthrough varicella, and among these, floating status is a novel risk factor.

22849900,[New vaccines].,"INTRODUCTION: Vaccines prevent more cases of diseases than any other medical treatment. However, information on new vaccines introduced in the market and not included in the National Vaccination Program (NVP) is often sparse, and their knowledge limited.
OBJECTIVES: Evaluate general and specific knowledge of healthy children's parents on three vaccines not included in the NVP: pneumococcal (PCV7), varicella (Var) and rotavirus (RV).
METHODS AND MATERIAL: Transversal descriptive study, in the format of a questionnaire applied randomly to parents of children that attended three Primary Care Centers of Portugal (Lisbon, Porto and Queluz), between March and April 2007. We analyzed sociodemographic parameters, level of knowledge (the existence and type of preventable disease by the three vaccines), its realization or intention of realization, and the availability of acquiring them by parents. Statistic analysis used Qui-Squares and T-Student tests (CI>95%), with p<0,05 considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: We interviewed 187 children's parents with a median age of 13 months. Most (82%) had incomplete schooling and a mean monthly income of 1256€. In 83% of the interviews, the parents knew at least one of the vaccines: pneumococcal (72%), varicella (42%) and rotavirus (1,3%), and applying the same order, the type of disease each vaccine prevented: 118/135 (87%), 83/84 (99%) and 21/24 (87,5%). In 80% of cases, health care professionals provided the information to parents: pediatrician (67) and primary care doctor (49). Most (96%) parents considered the PCV7 the most important vaccine. Of the children evaluated, 93% had the NVS actualized, additionally, 39% had the pneumococcal vaccine, 0,5% varicella and 3% rotavirus vaccine. Knowledge about the varicella and rotavirus was associated with a higher academic level of the parents (40 vs 46,p = 0,018; 8 vs 16,p = 0,026) and the acquisition of the pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccine with a higher income (1506€ vs 1144€; p = 0,04) and (2283€ vs 1162€; p = 0,04).
CONCLUSION: With exception of the PCV7 the remaining vaccines are still insufficiently known.

22863912,Serologic analysis of the IgG antibody response in children with varicella zoster virus wild-type infection and vaccination.,"INTRODUCTION: In contrast to varicella zoster virus (VZV) primary infection, VZV vaccination does not seem to provide lifelong immunity against varicella. Because more people get vaccinated every year, the development of sensitive serological test systems for the detection of protective anti-VZV IgG will become important in the future.
METHODS: We have previously developed a novel VZV line assay based on 5 different recombinant VZV antigens. In this study, we compared this novel assay with a commercially available glycoprotein enzyme immunoassay (RIDASCREEN VZV IgG) in detecting anti-VZV IgG of children with previous varicella infection and VZV vaccination.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five children were included in this study, 72 with a history of varicella infection and 53 with VZV vaccination. Both assays detected anti-VZV IgG antibodies in both study groups with similar sensitivities. The VZV line assay revealed striking differences in the anti-VZV IgG composition against the VZV open reading frames, 4, 14 and 49, between both study groups, indicating that wild-type varicella infection causes a more diverse immune response against VZV than does vaccination. The exploitation of these results enabled the discrimination of both study groups with a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.83, indicating that the serologic differentiation of children with previous varicella infection and VZV vaccination might be possible.
CONCLUSION: The VZV line assay enables the detection of anti-VZV IgG with sensitivities comparable to glycoprotein enzyme immunoassays and might be suitable for the serologic discrimination between children with a history of varicella infection and VZV vaccination.","['Jenke AC', 'Klein S', 'Baiker A', 'Wirth S', 'Sander M', 'Noelting C', 'Boecher O', 'Vizoso-Pinto MG']",2012,31,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Jenke AC, et al.

22859715,Varicella vaccines.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus infection (VZV) is widespread and clinically important as the cause of varicella pneumonitis and meningoencephalitis (a complication of primary infection/zoster) and post-herpetic neuralgia (a complication of zoster/secondary infection). The use of live-attenuated varicella vaccine to reduce the burden of these diseases has been established in many countries for a number of years.
SOURCES OF DATA: Original papers and review articles including guidelines and recommendations by the American Academy of Paediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and EuroSurveillance.
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Immunoassay of VZV IgG by enzyme immunosorbent assay is used as a surrogate marker for previous primary infection or successful immunization. Patients who have had natural primary infection do not require vaccination against varicella. Live VZV vaccines are safe and effective at protecting against disease caused by VZV. To ensure long-term protection, a two-dose immunization regime is strongly recommended, due to significant waning of protection following a single dose. Universal two-dose immunization has been shown to be cost-effective in Western temperate countries. In many countries, routine vaccination of children is recommended but, due to cost, often not provided by universal programmes. Cost-effectiveness of a universal programme will be determined by the baseline rate of severe varicella disease.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: No international consensus exists: measurement of VZV immunity or cost-effectiveness of introducing VZV vaccination to a country. Decisive factors will include the pre-vaccination burden of VZV-associated disease.","['Flatt A', 'Breuer J']",2012,103,1,Br Med Bull,Flatt A and Breuer J. Varicella vaccines.

Five days later, he started developing blistering of the skin over the trunk and extremities, which subsequently ruptured, leaving erythematous, tender raw areas with peeling of the skin. The mother had vesicular eruptions, which started on the second day of delivery and progressed over the next 3 days. Subsequently, similar eruptions were noticed in two of the siblings before affecting the neonate. On the basis of the exposure history and clinical picture, a diagnosis was made of varicella infection with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). The blood culture and the wound surface culture grew Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment included intravenous fluid, antibiotics, acyclovir and wound care. However, after 72 h of hospitalisation, the neonate first developed shock, refractory to fluid boluses, vasopressors and catecholamine along with other supports; and he then succumbed. In all neonates, staphylococcal infection with varicella can be fatal due to SSSS, the toxic shock syndrome or septicaemia.","['Singh SN', 'Tahazzul M', 'Singh A', 'Chandra S']",2012,2012,,BMJ Case Rep,"Singh SN, et al.

22845763,Vaccination status of children considered for renal transplants: missed opportunities for vaccine preventable diseases.,"OBJECTIVES: Infectious diseases, even vaccine preventable ones, might affect transplanting and the life course in pediatric solid-organ recipients. Owing to immunosuppression and decreased antibody production, susceptibility to infections is increased in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was designed to assess the vaccination and antibody status of the pediatric renal transplant patients. Fifty-one patients who were admitted to the regional transplant center for renal transplant were retrospectively evaluated. Patient 's vaccination charts were examined, and their immunization status was determined by antibody titers against hepatitis B, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.
RESULTS: The study group was composed of 23 males and 28 females (mean age, 10.8 y; age range, 2-17 y). All patients ' vaccination status was appropriate with their ages according to national vaccination program. Antibodies were positive for hepatitis B in 84.3% patients, 76.5% for hepatitis A, 72.5% for measles, 64.7% for mumps, 64.7% for rubella, and 72.5% for varicella.
CONCLUSIONS: Seronegativity for common childhood diseases may complicate the posttransplant period owing to increased risk of infections.

22845343,Management of chickenpox with frozen mother's milk.,"OBJECTIVES: If a mother has contracted chickenpox, the antibodies in her milk confer immunity against chickenpox to her breastfed babies. This passive immunization may avoid or spare the breastfed babies' symptoms of chickenpox. It is hypothesized that frozen breast milk may shorten chickenpox duration because specific antibodies against varicella zoster have been detected in human milk and they are resistant to digestion and are stable in frozen milk.
DESIGN: The clinical outcomes of chickenpox in a 9-year-old boy and his father on frozen breast milk are reported.
SETTINGS: The study comprised a varicella-vaccine-refusing family attending a private office of pediatrics.
INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: The boy presented with a crusted varicella rash. The medical history revealed premature cessation of the typical varicella rash on day 3. It was coincidental with a supply of frozen human milk by his mother. Next, the father (41 years old) of this patient contracted chickenpox: he was on frozen breast milk from day 2, and no new pox emerged thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS: The rash spread and numbered 50 to 150 lesions on day 2. Instead, the typical rash was expected to appear in three successive crops of lesions throughout the first week. The disease usually numbers approximately 250-500 lesions in unvaccinated healthy persons. Frozen breast milk may shorten chickenpox duration.","['Verd S', 'López E']",2012,18,8,J Altern Complement Med,Verd S and López E. Management of chickenpox with frozen mother's milk.

22830273,[Economical effectiveness of vaccination of cohort of children aged 2 years against chickenpox in the Russian Federation].,"AIM: Perform calculation of the economical effectiveness of realization of a program of vaccination of children aged 2 years against chickenpox (CP) in the Russian Federation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of Federal service on customers rights protection and human well-being surveillance on evaluation of morbidity and losses caused by CP in the Russian Federation in 2008 - 2010 were used. A cohort of children (1 760 000) aged 2 years subject to vaccination against CP in 2011, evaluation of cost of 1 case of the infection, the amount of losses per vaccination of 1 child were approximately determined; analysis of prevented losses by implementation ofvaccination program by using mathematical modeling methods was performed.
RESULTS: Without vaccination program in the Russian Federation the cost of losses per 1 case of CP related to hospitalization and outpatient visits as well as temporary disability of one of the parent in various age groups was: for children aged 1 - 2 years--8 333 RUB (Russian rubles), 3 - 6 years--21 171 RUB, 7 - 14 years--21 295 RUB. The cost of vaccination against CP of 1 child including 2 doses of vaccines with physician examination and vaccination procedure would be 1600 RUB. In the case of realization of vaccination program against CP in 2011 of children aged 2 years its cost would be 2 488.9 million RUB. Cost prevention already exceeds the cost of vaccination in 1 age cohort of children at year 2 and in 5 years the amount of prevented losses would exceed 15 billion RUB per 1 vaccinated cohort and would continue to increase steadily.
CONCLUSION: The performed calculations show that vaccination against CP in the Russian Federation is a highly efficient investment. Self-sufficiency of a program implemented in 2011 may be obtained already at the start of year 2 after the realization and by 2016 the net economical benefit would be around 8 milliards RUB.","['Kostinov MP', 'Zverev VV']",2012,,3,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,Kostinov MP and Zverev VV.

22800634,[Evaluation of the effect of varicella outbreak control measures through a discrete time delay SEIR model].,"OBJECTIVE: forecast the epidemic trend and to evaluate the effect of outbreak control measures by investigation of a varicella outbreak event with a discrete time delay SEIR model.
METHODS: A discrete time delay model was formulated by discretization method based on a continuous SEIR model with the consideration of the time delay effect on latent period and communicable period. The epidemic trend forecast was carried out based on the number of expected cases. The theoretical effect evaluation was assessed by comparing the results from different emergency control measures.
RESULTS: Without any control measures, the theoretical attack rate was 30.16% (504/1671). The course of the epidemic lasted for 4 months and the peak epidemic time was 78 days after the onset of the first case. 'Generation' phenomenon had been observed in the course of the epidemic with the interval of two weeks. The actual number of cases was decreased by 89.48% (451/504) compared with the number of expected cases under no control measure scenario. With the rigorous quarantine measure for all cases on their onset day, when the measure was conducted on 0, 14, 28, 42 days after the onset of the first case, the total numbers of expected cases were 22, 59, 127 and 220 respectively. With the quarantine measure conducted on 14 days after the onset of the first case, when the proportion of quarantine was 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, the total number of expected cases were 485, 457, 386 and 169, respectively. With the emergent vaccination for all persons, when the measure was conducted on 0, 14, 28, 42 days after the onset of the first case, the total numbers of expected cases were 7, 26, 81 and 202 respectively. With the emergent vaccination conducted on 14 days after the onset of the first case, when the immunization coverage rate was 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, the total numbers of expected cases were 354, 246, 127 and 40, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The number of expected cases can be regarded as the reference to evaluate the effect of control measures. The simulation results suggest that it will get more benefits to conduct control measures earlier in varicella outbreak events, and the effect of emergent vaccination is better than that of quarantine measure under the same conditions.","['Pan JR', 'Huang ZQ', 'Chen K']",2012,46,4,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Pan JR, et al.

22776384,"Measles, rubella, and varicella among the crew of a cruise ship sailing from Florida, United States, 2006.","BACKGROUND: Cruise ship outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) such as rubella and varicella have been previously associated with introduction and spread among susceptible crew members originating from countries with endemic transmission of these diseases.
METHODS: During February to April 2006, we investigated a cluster of rash illnesses due to measles, rubella, or varicella on a cruise ship sailing from Florida to the Caribbean. Case-finding measures included review of medical logs, active surveillance for rash illness among crew members, and passive surveillance for rash illness in the ship's infirmary lasting two incubation periods from the last case of measles. Passengers with potential exposure to these VPD were notified by letters. All susceptible crew members with potential exposure were administered the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after informed consent.
RESULTS: A total of 16 cases were identified only among crew members: 1 rubella, 3 measles (two-generation spread), 11 varicella (three-generation spread), and 1 unknown diagnosis. Of 1,197 crew members evaluated, 4 had proof of immunity to measles and rubella. Based on passive surveillance, no cases were identified among passengers, the majority of whom resided in the United States.
CONCLUSION: The international makeup of the population aboard cruise ships combined with their semi-enclosed environment has the potential to facilitate introduction and spread of VPD such as measles, rubella, and varicella onboard and into communities. Cruise lines should ensure crew members have evidence of immunity to these diseases. Passengers should be up to date with all vaccinations, including those that are travel-specific, prior to embarking on cruise travel.","['Mitruka K', 'Felsen CB', 'Tomianovic D', 'Inman B', 'Street K', 'Yambor P', 'Reef SE']",2012,19,4,J Travel Med,"Mitruka K, et al.

22776383,Management and control of varicella on cruise ships: a collaborative approach to promoting public health.,"BACKGROUND: In most years varicella is the vaccine-preventable disease most frequently reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by cruise ships. Since 2005, CDC has received numerous isolated case reports of varicella among crew members and has investigated varicella outbreaks aboard vessels sailing into and from US seaports.
METHODS: CDC investigators reviewed electronic varicella case reports from 2005 to 2009 and outbreak reports from 2009 to characterize the response and control efforts implemented by cruise ships in accordance with CDC protocols. Outbreak reports from 2009 were manually reviewed for details of case identification, contact investigations, isolation and restriction of cases and contacts, respectively, and number of contacts administered varicella vaccine post-exposure by cruise lines.
RESULTS: During 2005 to 2009, cruise ships reported 278 cases of varicella to CDC among predominantly male (80%) crew members, three-quarters of whom were residents of Caribbean countries, Indonesia, the Philippines, or India, and whose median age was 29 years. Cases were more commonly reported during spring and winter months. During 2009, cruise ships reported 94 varicella cases among crew members of which 66 (70%) were associated with 18 reported varicella outbreaks. Outbreak response included isolation of 66 (100%) of 66 cases, restriction of 66 (26%) of 255 crew-contacts, and administration of post-exposure vaccine to 522 close contacts and other susceptible crew members per standard CDC recommendations.
DISCUSSION: Most cases reported to CDC during 2005 to 2009 were among non-US resident crew members. Overall, cruise lines sailing into North America have the onboard capability to manage varicella cases and outbreaks and appear responsive to CDC recommendations. Cruise lines should continue to implement CDC-recommended response protocols to curtail outbreaks rapidly and should consider whether pre-placement varicella immunity screening and vaccination of crew members is a cost-effective option for their respective fleet operations.","['Cramer EH', 'Slaten DD', 'Guerreiro A', 'Robbins D', 'Ganzon A']",2012,19,4,J Travel Med,"Cramer EH, et al.

To eliminate blood-derived products of human origin from the manufacturing process of the MMRV vaccine, recombinant human albumin was selected as a replacement for human serum albumin.
METHODS: This open-label, multicenter clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00560755) was designed to describe the safety profile of a 2-dose schedule of the MMRV vaccine at a 1-month interval in healthy children aged 12-22 months.
RESULTS: In total, 3388 children received at least 1 dose of the MMRV vaccine. Overall, 3376 (99.65%) children were included in the post-dose 1 safety analysis and 3342 (98.64%) in the post-dose 2 safety analysis.

This survey asked health care givers in the developed and developing worlds to rate pain intensity of 12 common childhood diseases and to inventory the pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment modalities in their settings. A survey was distributed online (Surveygizmo 3.0) to pediatric health caregivers who rated perceived painfulness of 12 diseases on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale or stated that the disease was primarily discomforting in their opinion. Also they inventoried the pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions they utilize in their setting. Sixty-five respondents completed the survey, of whom almost three thirds (72.3%) came from developed countries. Median painfulness scores ranged from 5 (chickenpox) to 9 (compound tibial fracture).

22761371,Pangaea and the Out-of-Africa Model of Varicella-Zoster Virus Evolution and Phylogeography.,"The goal of this minireview is to provide an overview of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) phylogenetics and phylogeography when placed in the broad context of geologic time. Planet Earth was formed over 4 billion years ago, and the supercontinent Pangaea coalesced around 400 million years ago (mya). Based on detailed tree-building models, the base of the phylogenetic tree of the Herpesviridae family has been estimated at 400 mya. Subsequently, Pangaea split into Laurasia and Gondwanaland; in turn, Africa rifted from Gondwanaland. Based on available data, the hypothesis of this minireview is that the ancestral alphaherpesvirus VZV coevolved in simians, apes, and hominins in Africa. When anatomically modern humans first crossed over the Red Sea 60,000 years ago, VZV was carried along in their dorsal root ganglia. Currently, there are five VZV clades, distinguishable by single nucleotide polymorphisms. These clades likely represent continued VZV coevolution, as humans with latent VZV infection left Arabia and dispersed into Asia (clades 2 and 5) and Europe (clades 1, 3, and 4). The prototype VZV sequence contains nearly 125,000 bp, divided into 70 open reading frames. Generally, isolates within a clade display >99.9% identity to one another, while members of one clade compared to a second clade show 99.8% identity to one another. Recently, four different VZV genotypes that do not segregate into the previously defined five clades have been identified, a result indicating a wider than anticipated diversity among newly collected VZV strains around the world.",['Grose C'],2012,86,18,J Virol,Grose C.

22750018,Epidemiology of varicella in Mexico.,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiological patterns of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, which are strongly associated with climate, are characterized by more frequent infections occurring among children in temperate regions than in the tropics. In temperate regions, varicella exhibits a seasonal cyclic behavior in which the number of cases increases significantly during the winter and spring seasons, further supporting the role of environmental factors in disease transmission. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this distinctive behavior are not fully understood. In Mexico, information regarding the epidemiology of varicella is scarce, and the distribution of VZV infection has not been analyzed.
OBJECTIVES: In this article we investigate the epidemiological patterns of varicella in Mexico and their relationship with different environmental and demographic factors.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted using the data reported by the National Center of Epidemiological Surveillance and Disease Control. The overall varicella incidence was calculated and associated with temperature, overcrowding, age, gender and population density.
RESULTS: The epidemiology of varicella showed an intriguing pattern, in which warmer regions were characterized by higher incidences than in temperate regions. Young children were the most affected age group. There was no correlation between varicella incidence and overcrowding or population density.
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of varicella in Mexico significantly departs from the characteristic patterns observed in other tropical latitudes, with some features resembling those commonly associated with temperate regions.","['Vergara-Castañeda A', 'Escobar-Gutiérrez A', 'Ruiz-Tovar K', 'Sotelo J', 'Ordoñez G', 'Cruz-Rivera MY', 'Fonseca-Coronado S', 'Martinez-Guarneros A', 'Carpio-Pedroza JC', 'Vaughan G']",2012,55,1,J Clin Virol,"Vergara-Castañeda A, et al.

22746055,[A case of adult-onset varicella pneumonia and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) meningitis resulting from a reoccurrence of varicella].,"The patient was a 74-year old male who presented with a skin rash, cough, and impaired consciousness. A diffuse, systemic, dark red rash was observed and he was admitted. Varicella infection was diagnosed based on the varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-IgM levels. The extremely high VZV- IgG levels observed were unlikely to be present in an initial infection and the infection was thought to be a reoccurrence. Diffuse nodular shadows measuring < or = 5 mm in diameter were observed on chest computed tomography (CT);this was consistent with the typical imaging findings of varicella pneumonia. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for CSF VZV-IgM antibody, CSF VZV-PCR, and CSF antibody titer index. A diagnosis of varicella meningitis was made. When both respiratory and neurological symptoms are observed in patients with varicella infection, it is necessary to consider a combined diagnosis of varicella pneumonia and varicella meningitis/encephalitis and perform chest imaging and a CSF examination. Repeated asymptomatic re-infection is considered necessary in order to maintain a lifelong immunity to varicella; however, the opportunities for asymptomatic re-infection are decreasing with the declining birth rate and trend toward small families. As a result, reoccurrences of varicella infection in the elderly are expected to increase with rapidly increasing longevity.","['Yamashita H', 'Ueda Y', 'Takahashi Y', 'Akio M']",2012,86,3,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Yamashita H, et al.

26038416,Streptococcus pyogenes and re-emergence of scarlet fever as a public health problem.,"Explosive outbreaks of infectious diseases occasionally occur without immediately obvious epidemiological or microbiological explanations. Plague, cholera and Streptococcus pyogenes infection are some of the epidemic-prone bacterial infections. Besides epidemiological and conventional microbiological methods, the next-generation gene sequencing technology permits prompt detection of genomic and transcriptomic profiles associated with invasive phenotypes. Horizontal gene transfer due to mobile genetic elements carrying virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance, or mutations associated with the two component CovRS operon are important bacterial factors conferring survival advantage or invasiveness. The high incidence of scarlet fever in children less than 10 years old suggests that the lack of protective immunity is an important host factor. A high population density, overcrowded living environment and a low yearly rainfall are environmental factors contributing to outbreak development. Inappropriate antibiotic use is not only ineffective for treatment, but may actually drive an epidemic caused by drug-resistant strains and worsen patient outcomes by increasing the bacterial density at the site of infection and inducing toxin production. Surveillance of severe S. pyogenes infection is important because it can complicate concurrent chickenpox and influenza. Concomitant outbreaks of these two latter infections with a highly virulent and drug-resistant S. pyogenes strain can be disastrous.","['Wong SS', 'Yuen KY']",2012,1,7,Emerg Microbes Infect,Wong SS and Yuen KY.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old healthy man, who suffered from chickenpox 2 weeks prior to symptom development, exhibited mild anterior chamber cells, vitreous opacity, sheathing of retinal veins, and yellow-white exudates in his right eye. Varicella zoster virus DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the aqueous humor. He was treated with intravenous acyclovir followed by oral prednisolone and valaciclovir. Aqueous cells quickly disappeared and retinal exudates diminished within 1 month, leaving faint retinal scarring. Retinal arteritis had never been observed in this patient.
CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH THE OCULAR FINDINGS IN THIS CASE WERE SIMILAR TO ACUTE RETINAL NECROSIS (ARN), THE CLINICAL FEATURES DIFFERED FROM ARN IN THE FOLLOWING POINTS: (1) mild anterior chamber inflammation, (2) absence of retinal arteritis, and (3) prompt resolution of inflammatory findings.

Varicella is a self- limited infection, while zoster is mainly a disease of adults. The present study was conducted to isolate VZV from clinically diagnosed children using cell cultures and compare the activity of liquorice powder extract, an alternative herbal antiviral agent, with acyclovir and interferon alpha 2a (IFN-α2a) against the isolated virus.
METHODS: Forty-eight VZV specimens, 26 from vesicular aspirates and 22 from vesicular swabs, from children clinically diagnosed with varicella were isolated on the Vero cell line. Isolates were propagated and identified with specific antiserum using indirect immunofluorescence and immunodot blotting assays. The growth kinetics of the viral isolates was studied. The antiviral activity of liquorice powder extract, acyclovir (ACV) and IFN-α2a was evaluated against the isolated virus.
RESULTS: VZV was successfully isolated in 4 of the 48 specimens, all from vesicular aspirates. The growth kinetics of the viral isolates was time dependent. The inhibitory activity of liquorice powder extract (containing 125 µg/ml glycyrrhizin) when compared to ACV (250 µg/ml) and IFN-α2a is the lowest.
CONCLUSIONS: VZV isolates were successfully isolated and propagated using Vero cells. Isolates were identified using indirect immunofluorescent and immunodot blotting techniques. Growth kinetics of the isolates revealed an increase in the viral infectivity titer relative to time. Glycyrrhizin in the crude form has low antiviral activity against VZV compared with acyclovir and interferon.","['Shebl RI', 'Amin MA', 'Emad-Eldin A', 'Bin Dajem SM', 'Mostafa AS', 'Ibrahim EH', 'Mohamed AF']",2012,35,3,Chang Gung Med J,"Shebl RI, et al.

22721551,Seroprevalence of varicella-zoster virus and predictors for seronegativity in the Amsterdam adult population.,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is considered a benign common childhood illness and routine vaccination against VZV is not done. In 1995 it was estimated that 98-100% of the adult Dutch general population is immune, yet the estimate is based on a database in which a relative small number of people of non-Dutch ethnic origin were represented. As the city of Amsterdam has large immigrant communities originating from various subtropical and tropical countries, such as Morocco, Surinam, and Turkey with probably lower VZV transmission, this study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of VZV IgG antibodies (anti-VZV) among various ethnic groups in Amsterdam, and identify factors associated with seronegative VZV status.
METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey of the Amsterdam population (2004), and the study sample was stratified by age and ethnicity, with deliberate oversampling of minority ethnic groups. Serum samples obtained from 1,341 residents in 2004 were tested for antibodies to VZV. Basic demographic data (gender, age, country of birth, age at immigration and number of children) were also available.
RESULTS: The anti-VZV seroprevalence in the overall Amsterdam population was estimated to be 94% (95% confidence intervals; 92-96%). Regarding ethnic origin, first generation immigrants (Moroccan immigrants 90%, Surinamese or Antillean immigrants 91%, and Turkish 92%), especially those that migrated after the age of 11 years, were more likely to be anti-VZV seronegative compared to those arriving at an earlier age or those born in the Netherlands (97-98%). Both ethnic origin and generation of immigration were positive predictors for IgG seronegativity to VZV (p<0.015). No other predictors for seronegativity were found.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study imply that about 4-8% of the general adult Amsterdam population is still susceptible to infection with VZV, and that susceptibility is even higher in some immigrant groups. When assessing the risk of infection after VZV exposure alertness is needed for vulnerable persons like pregnant women, patients with hematological malignancies or organ transplants in particular among first-generation immigrants.","['van Rijckevorsel GG', 'Damen M', 'Sonder GJ', 'van der Loeff MF', 'van den Hoek A']",2012,12,,BMC Infect Dis,"van Rijckevorsel GG, et al.

We describe pathologic findings utilizing autopsy tissue from several organs from a patient affected by a new variant of endemic pemphigus in El Bagre, Colombia, South America.
CASE REPORT: We describe a patient by a new variant of endemic pemphigus foliaceus from El Bagre that was receiving high-dosage immunosuppressants when hospitalized and died suddenly following contact with a second patient affected by chicken pox.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed studies utilizing hematoxylin and eosin, immunohistochemistry, and direct immunofluorescence techniques on tissues from several organs.
RESULTS: We detected the presence of varicella zoster virus, as well as strong positivity for α-1 antitrypsin in the heart, kidneys, spleen, liver, skin, brain, lungs, pancreas, small and large intestines, and skeletal muscle. In regard to structural damage in the kidney and heart, we believe the observed damage is associated with the presence of autoantibodies to these organs, since both of them are rich in plakins and El Bagre-EPF patients present significant antibodies to plakin molecules.
CONCLUSION: In patients with endemic pemphigus foliaceus, we recommend complete isolation of the patient when receiving high dosages of systemic immunosuppressive agents. We further suggest the clinical possibility of a synergistic, fatal interaction between active pemphigus foliaceus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, immunosuppressive agents, and a systemic activation of α-1 antitrypsin. Thus, we suggest adequate bed spacing, barrier nursing, and preventative testing for α-1 antitrypsin activation are warranted in these patients to address these complications.","['Abreu Velez AM', 'Smoller BR', 'Gao W', 'Grossniklaus HE', 'Jiao Z', 'Arias LF', 'Dudley SC', 'Howard MS']",2012,51,7,Int J Dermatol,"Abreu Velez AM, et al.

22687763,"A varicella outbreak in a school with high one-dose vaccination coverage, Beijing, China.","BACKGROUND: Varicella vaccine is available in the private sector in China, with a single dose currently recommended for children aged ≥12 months. We investigated a varicella outbreak in a school in Beijing with high varicella vaccination coverage to describe the outbreak, examine risk factors for vaccine failure, and calculate vaccine effectiveness.
METHODS: A varicella case was defined as an acute generalized maculopapular rash without other apparent cause in a student without prior varicella attending the elementary school during August 30-December 28, 2010. Varicella among vaccinated students (breakthrough varicella) was defined as varicella occurring >42 days after vaccination. Students' vaccination status was verified with immunization records and clinical presentations were collected from health care practitioners.
RESULTS: Of the 951 students, 934 (98%) had no prior varicella history. Among these students, 916 had received 1 dose of varicella vaccine and 2 had received 2 doses (98% vaccination coverage) before the outbreak. A total of 87 cases occurred during the outbreak; most had breakthrough varicella (86/87, 99%) and mild disease (83/87, 95%). Age at vaccination (<15 months vs. ≥15 months) and time since vaccination before outbreak (<5 years vs. ≥5 years) were not associated with development of breakthrough varicella. Single-dose varicella vaccination was 89% effective in preventing any varicella and 99% in preventing moderate/severe varicella.
CONCLUSION: Single-dose varicella vaccination is highly effective in reducing varicella incidence and mitigating disease severity, but not high enough to prevent outbreak. A two-dose program might help to prevent varicella outbreaks in Beijing.","['Lu L', 'Suo L', 'Li J', 'Zhai L', 'Zheng Q', 'Pang X', 'Bialek SR', 'Wang C']",2012,30,34,Vaccine,"Lu L, et al.

22685402,3D reconstruction of VZV infected cell nuclei and PML nuclear cages by serial section array scanning electron microscopy and electron tomography.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human alphaherpesvirus that causes varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Like all herpesviruses, the VZV DNA genome is replicated in the nucleus and packaged into nucleocapsids that must egress across the nuclear membrane for incorporation into virus particles in the cytoplasm. Our recent work showed that VZV nucleocapsids are sequestered in nuclear cages formed from promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in vitro and in human dorsal root ganglia and skin xenografts in vivo. We sought a method to determine the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of nucleocapsids in the nuclei of herpesvirus-infected cells as well as the 3D shape, volume and ultrastructure of these unique PML subnuclear domains. Here we report the development of a novel 3D imaging and reconstruction strategy that we term Serial Section Array-Scanning Electron Microscopy (SSA-SEM) and its application to the analysis of VZV-infected cells and these nuclear PML cages. We show that SSA-SEM permits large volume imaging and 3D reconstruction at a resolution sufficient to localize, count and distinguish different types of VZV nucleocapsids and to visualize complete PML cages. This method allowed a quantitative determination of how many nucleocapsids can be sequestered within individual PML cages (sequestration capacity), what proportion of nucleocapsids are entrapped in single nuclei (sequestration efficiency) and revealed the ultrastructural detail of the PML cages. More than 98% of all nucleocapsids in reconstructed nuclear volumes were contained in PML cages and single PML cages sequestered up to 2,780 nucleocapsids, which were shown by electron tomography to be embedded and cross-linked by an filamentous electron-dense meshwork within these unique subnuclear domains. This SSA-SEM analysis extends our recent characterization of PML cages and provides a proof of concept for this new strategy to investigate events during virion assembly at the single cell level.","['Reichelt M', 'Joubert L', 'Perrino J', 'Koh AL', 'Phanwar I', 'Arvin AM']",2012,8,6,PLoS Pathog,"Reichelt M, et al. 3D reconstruction of VZV infected cell nuclei and PML nuclear cages by serial section array scanning electron microscopy and electron tomography. 3D reconstruction of VZV infected cell nuclei and PML nuclear cages by serial section array scanning electron microscopy and electron tomography. 2012; 8:e1002740. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002740",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22685402/

We conducted a study to review the type and the rate of varicella neurological complications in a case series of hospitalized immunologically healthy children over nearly a 8 year period. We also systematically reviewed data from the literature to estimate the rate of varicella neurological complications. In our case reports, the proportion of neurological complications among all those hospitalized for varicella was of 21.7% (CI 17.9-26%). The pooled prevalence of neurological complications resulting from the systematic review of the literature identifies the likelihood of such complications in the range of 13.9-20.4%. Although neurological complications of chickenpox do not frequently result in permanent sequelae, they represent significant determinants of prolonged hospital stay and of other indirect costs. The obtained results may be useful for estimating costs associated with hospitalization from varicella in cost-benefit analysis for immunization.","['Bozzola E', 'Tozzi AE', 'Bozzola M', 'Krzysztofiak A', 'Valentini D', 'Grandin A', 'Villani A']",2012,30,39,Vaccine,"Bozzola E, et al.

22681715,Wolf's isotopic response: a series of 9 cases.,"INTRODUCTION: The term Wolf's isotopic response refers to the appearance of a new skin disease at the site of an already healed, unrelated disease. In most cases, the initial disease is herpes zoster. Different diseases may subsequently develop on the same site. The most common isotopic responses are granulomatous and lichenoid reactions, infiltrations of hematologic diseases, skin tumors, and infections. The pathogenesis of these skin reactions is unknown. It has been suggested that viral infection may alter local skin immunity; this would favor hyperreactivity, leading to inflammatory processes, or local immunosuppression, leading to tumor infiltrations or infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 9 patients diagnosed with Wolf's isotopic response in the dermatology department of Hospital Donostia in San Sebastian, Spain. Five patients had B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 2 had a non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1 had ovarian carcinoma.
RESULTS: The initial disease was herpes zoster in 7 cases, and chickenpox and herpes simplex in the other 2 cases. The second disease was granulomatous dermatitis in 4 cases, lichenoid dermatitis in 2 cases, infiltration by B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia in 2 cases, and infiltration by systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1 case. In the last case, the skin lesions were the first sign of the lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the need to biopsy these second lesions in order to rule out tumor infiltrations, which were more frequent than expected in our series.","['Jaka-Moreno A', 'López-Pestaña A', 'López-Núñez M', 'Ormaechea-Pérez N', 'Vildosola-Esturo S', 'Tuneu-Valls A', 'Lobo-Morán C']",2012,103,9,Actas Dermosifiliogr,"Jaka-Moreno A, et al.

22678561,Immunity to varicella-zoster virus in Croatian women of reproductive age targeted for serology testing.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in Croatian pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age.
METHODS: During 2007-2011, a total of 638 women aged 16-45 years were tested for the presence of VZV IgM and IgG antibodies using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Samples positive for IgG antibodies with positive or equivocal IgM antibodies were tested for IgG avidity.
RESULTS: The overall IgG seroprevalence was 84.3 %. There was a significant increase in IgG seropositivity with age (OR = 1.04 for 1-year increase in age; 95 % CI 1.01-1.08). The lowest seroprevalence rate was reported in the 16-20 age groups (78.6 %), and the highest was in the 41-45 age groups (94.3 %). There was no significant difference in seroprevalence among women residing in urban and rural areas (83.6 vs. 87.0 %, OR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.43-1.34).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study have shown that a high proportion of Croatian childbearing-aged women (15.7 %) who were referred to the laboratory for VZV serology testing are susceptible to VZV and, thus, at risk for contracting varicella during pregnancy. Serology testing of adolescent girls and adult women who do not have a documented history of varicella is encouraged with the aim of vaccinating seronegative girls and women against VZV before pregnancy. In addition, testing of pregnant women is advised to identify susceptible women and vaccinate them after delivery.","['Vilibic-Cavlek T', 'Ljubin-Sternak S', 'Kolaric B', 'Kaic B', 'Sviben M', 'Kos L', 'Mlinaric-Galinovic G']",2012,286,4,Arch Gynecol Obstet,"Vilibic-Cavlek T, et al.

22674980,ORF7 of varicella-zoster virus is a neurotropic factor.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of chickenpox and herpes zoster (shingles). After the primary infection, the virus remains latent in sensory ganglia and reactivates upon weakening of the cellular immune system due to various conditions, erupting from sensory neurons and infecting the corresponding skin tissue. The current varicella vaccine is highly attenuated in the skin and yet retains its neurovirulence and may reactivate and damage sensory neurons. The factors involved in neuronal invasion and establishment of latency are still elusive. Previously, we constructed a library of whole-gene deletion mutants carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome sequence and a luciferase marker in order to perform a comprehensive VZV genome functional analysis. Here, screening of dispensable gene deletion mutants in differentiated neuronal cells led to the identification of ORF7 as the first known, likely a main, VZV neurotropic factor. ORF7 is a virion component localized to the Golgi compartment in infected cells, whose deletion causes loss of polykaryon formation in epithelial cell culture. Interestingly, ORF7 deletion completely abolishes viral spread in human nervous tissue ex vivo and in an in vivo mouse model. This finding adds to our previous report that ORF7 is also a skin-tropic factor. The results of our investigation will not only lead to a better understanding of VZV neurotropism but could also contribute to the development of a neuroattenuated vaccine candidate against shingles or a vector for delivery of other antigens.","['Selariu A', 'Cheng T', 'Tang Q', 'Silver B', 'Yang L', 'Liu C', 'Ye X', 'Markus A', 'Goldstein RS', 'Cruz-Cosme RS', 'Lin Y', 'Wen L', 'Qian H', 'Han J', 'Dulal K', 'Huang Y', 'Li Y', 'Xia N', 'Zhu H']",2012,86,16,J Virol,"Selariu A, et al.

22659447,"Review of the United States universal varicella vaccination program: Herpes zoster incidence rates, cost-effectiveness, and vaccine efficacy based primarily on the Antelope Valley Varicella Active Surveillance Project data.","In a cooperative agreement starting January 1995, prior to the FDA's licensure of the varicella vaccine on March 17, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded the Los Angeles Department of Health Services' Antelope Valley Varicella Active Surveillance Project (AV-VASP). Since only varicella case reports were gathered, baseline incidence data for herpes zoster (HZ) or shingles was lacking. Varicella case reports decreased 72%, from 2834 in 1995 to 836 in 2000 at which time approximately 50% of children under 10 years of age had been vaccinated. Starting in 2000, HZ surveillance was added to the project. By 2002, notable increases in HZ incidence rates were reported among both children and adults with a prior history of natural varicella. However, CDC authorities still claimed that no increase in HZ had occurred in any US surveillance site. The basic assumptions inherent to the varicella cost-benefit analysis ignored the significance of exogenous boosting caused by those shedding wild-type VZV. Also ignored was the morbidity associated with even rare serious events following varicella vaccination as well as the morbidity from increasing cases of HZ among adults. Vaccine efficacy declined below 80% in 2001. By 2006, because 20% of vaccinees were experiencing breakthrough varicella and vaccine-induced protection was waning, the CDC recommended a booster dose for children and, in 2007, a shingles vaccination was approved for adults aged 60 years and older. In the prelicensure era, 95% of adults experienced natural chickenpox (usually as children)-these cases were usually benign and resulted in long-term immunity. Varicella vaccination is less effective than the natural immunity that existed in prevaccine communities. Universal varicella vaccination has not proven to be cost-effective as increased HZ morbidity has disproportionately offset cost savings associated with reductions in varicella disease. Universal varicella vaccination has failed to provide long-term protection from VZV disease.","['Goldman GS', 'King PG']",2013,31,13,Vaccine,"Goldman GS and King PG.

CLINICAL FEATURES: A 6-month-old white female infant presented with a vesicular rash of the right lower extremity to a chiropractic office. The rash consisted of grouped vesicles on erythematous plaques, the characteristic herpetiform lesion, distributed in the S1 dermatome of the right lower extremity only. The infant's history was significant for exposure to chicken pox at age 1 week through siblings. Consequently, only one vesicle developed, representing subclinical chicken pox. The clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster was made.
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The infant was treated conservatively at home. Treatment consisted of aluminum acetate (Burow) solution compresses 3 times each day, followed by a loose dressing. The lesions crusted in 1 week and completely resolved in 2 weeks. Follow-up, consisting of 13 years of observation, demonstrated no evidence of sequelae, such as postherpetic neuralgia, or recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Herpes zoster is uncommon in infants; however, it may occur. The presentation of the rash is characteristic; but otherwise, the condition differs from that in adults in that it is mild and not associated with postherpetic neuralgia. In uncomplicated cases, conservative treatment measures support the quick resolution with no sequelae.","['Aikenhead KJ', 'Johnson TL']",2011,10,4,J Chiropr Med,Aikenhead KJ and Johnson TL.

26069765,Chickenpox infection after renal transplantation.,"BACKGROUND: Chicken pox, although a common infection among children, is rare in immunocompromised patients, particularly renal transplant recipients, and carries a very high incidence of morbidity and mortality There is little data on chickenpox in adult renal transplant recipients, although reports have suggested that it may follow a virulent course requiring frequent hospitalization, and in severe cases can cause death.
AIMS: To evaluate the incidence, severity and complications of a varicella/chickenpox infection in renal transplant recipients over 10 years follow-up.
RESULTS: An incidence of 1.48% of our patients were diagnosed with varicella infection during this 10-year period from June 2000 to June 2010 in our live-related renal transplant program, with a median patient age of 39 years (range 21-54 years). Graft dysfunction was observed among five patients following the infection, two of whom became dialysis-dependent. The other three had mild graft dysfunction from which they subsequently recovered, suggesting that infection was responsible for graft dysfunction. None of them developed rejection following exposure or with modification of immunosuppression. All of our patients required admission with 47.8% presenting with various presentations, with orchitis, pancreatitis, encephalitis and gastritis each affecting 8.6% of the patients. All patients were managed with intravenous acyclovir for 2 weeks followed by oral acyclovir for 3 months. The infection was associated with an increased mortality of 13.4% due to superadded infections and central nervous system involvement in one patient with fatal bilateral pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: This infection, which is a benign disease with a largely stable course among the general population, can have severe outcomes for immunocompromised patients, accounting for almost 90% with significant morbidity and mortality in the 8.6% of infected patients, thus highlighting the importance of pre-transplant vaccination in this subgroup of the population.","['Kaul A', 'Sharma RK', 'Bhadhuria D', 'Gupta A', 'Prasad N']",2012,5,3,Clin Kidney J,"Kaul A, et al.

Publicly funded routine immunization programs at 12 or 15 months of age were introduced by 5 provinces and territories (prov/terr) in 2000 to 2002 (earlier programs, EP) and by 8 prov/terr in 2004 to 2007 (later programs, LP).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the number of varicella-related hospitalized cases had declined by 2008 at 12 IMPACT centers after the sequential introduction of publicly funded varicella immunization programs in Canada.
METHODS: Varicella-related hospitalizations from 2000 to 2008 in the prov/terr with EP were under surveillance by 3 IMPACT centers (Halifax, Edmonton, Calgary), whereas the prov/terr with LP were under surveillance by the remaining 9 centers. The age, gender, underlying health status, varicella complications, and length of stay in hospital and the pediatric intensive care unit were documented. Breakthrough cases were identified and their clinical characteristics described.
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2008, the number of varicella-related hospitalized cases in IMPACT centers declined relatively sooner in prov/terr with EP (by 2002 to 2003), as compared to those with LP (only by 2007 to 2008). In 2008, varicella-related hospitalized cases declined by 88% in the EP centers, and by 81% in the LP centers. In all IMPACT centers, the greatest decline occurred in the 1-4 years age group (90% decline), with smaller declines in both <1 year and 5-9 years age groups (78% and 76% decline, respectively). Breakthrough disease accounted for 39 (2%) cases, with the proportion due to breakthrough increasing from 0.9% in 2000 to 2001, to 2% in 2003 to 2004 and 9.5% in 2007 to 2008. The majority (72%) of breakthrough cases were in immunocompromised children.
CONCLUSIONS: Publicly funded varicella vaccination programs have led to a significant decline in varicella-related hospitalizations in Canadian children, as a result of direct effects of the program beginning within 1 to 2 years after the start, as well as probable indirect protection of children outside the vaccinated cohort.","['Tan B', 'Bettinger J', 'McConnell A', 'Scheifele D', 'Halperin S', 'Vaudry W', 'Law B', 'Members of the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program, Active (IMPACT)']",2012,31,9,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Tan B, et al.

22634994,[Direct costs of complicated chicken pox in a Colombian pediatric population].,"OBJECTIVE: Estimating the cost of chicken pox in a Colombian pediatric population.
METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective case study which searched for all diagnosed chicken pox cases in the Napoleón Franco Pareja children's hospital (Cartagena, Colombia), during 2005-2008. The hospital's records/perspective was used. Cost related to health personnel, lab, diagnostic images and drugs were searched. The micro-costing was made at Colombian peso prices for 2010. An adjustment was made for inflation.
RESULTS: Mean hospital costs were $ 898,766 (Q1: $ 197,348; Q3: $ 1,195,262). Mean hospital cost per day was $ 221,777 (Q1: $ 97,027; Q3: $ 293,740). Mean cost <1 year-old patients was $ 980,742 (Q1: $ 905,708; Q3: $ 1,026,031). Mean cost was $ 105,833 in 5-12 year-old patients (Q1: $ 39,568; Q3: $ 891,824).
CONCLUSIONS: The results were similar to those of previous studies (in Panama and some developed countries) highlighting relatively high illness costs in Colombia. These results increase the evidence in favor of vaccination and invite Colombian public health officials to consider introducing a chicken pox vaccine into Colombia.","['Alvis-Guzmán N', 'Paternina-Caicedo A', 'Alvis-Estrada L', 'De la Hoz-Restrepo F']",2011,13,6,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota),"Alvis-Guzmán N, et al.

22627868,Herpes zoster in a partially vaccinated pediatric population in central Israel.,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed during an era of partial vaccination with varicella vaccine in Israel to characterize ambulatory pediatric herpes zoster (HZ) cases in a population with partial varicella vaccination coverage.
METHODS: Data were collected from computerized databases of a population of 114,000 children. Records of children aged 0-18 years, diagnosed with HZ during 2006 to 2008 were reviewed by pediatric infectious diseases experts. Telephone interviews were done with a sample of the parents to get further clinical details.
RESULTS: Of 692 medical records reviewed, 450 cases were approved for analysis, and 77 interviews were conducted. Incidence of HZ was 130 of 100,000 person life-years. Peak incidence was detected in children aged 9-11 years (222/100,000 person life-years). Pain and fever accompanied 52% and 13% of episodes, respectively. Higher risk for HZ was found in children who had varicella during their first year of life (relative risk and 95% confidence interval: 13.5[9.6-18.8]; P < 0.001), and in children who had varicella during the second year of life (relative risk = 2 [1.5-2.6]; P < 0.001). Vaccination was found to be protective against HZ (relative risk = 0.42 [0.33-0.55]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of HZ seems to be changing in a population with partial varicella vaccination rate. Our results may suggest that children who contracted chicken pox in their first year of life may benefit from varicella vaccination.","['Stein M', 'Cohen R', 'Bromberg M', 'Tasher D', 'Shohat T', 'Somekh E']",2012,31,9,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Stein M, et al.

22622699,"Immunogenicity and safety of two tetravalent (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) vaccines coadministered with hepatitis a and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines to children twelve to fourteen months of age.","BACKGROUND: This study compared single-dose tetravalent measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, Priorix-Tetra, stored refrigerated (GSK+4C) or frozen (GSK-20C), with ProQuad (Merck-20C), when coadministered with hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7).
METHODS: Multicenter, observer-blind phase 2 study in 1783 healthy 12-14 month olds randomized to: GSK+4C (n = 705), GSK-20C (n = 689) or Merck-20C (n = 389), administered concomitantly with HAV (Havrix) and PCV7 (Prevnar). Seroresponse rates and antibody geometric mean concentrations/titers were determined from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assays. Reactogenicity and safety were assessed.
RESULTS: Seroresponse rates (day 42) were >97% for measles and rubella viruses and >92% for mumps virus, in all groups. Noninferiority of both GSK+4C and GSK-20C vaccines versus Merck-20C was demonstrated for seroresponse rates to measles, mumps and rubella viruses (lower 97.5% confidence interval above -5%, -10% and -5%, respectively). For varicella-zoster virus, seroresponse rates were 57.1%, 69.8% and 86.7% in the GSK+4C, GSK-20C and Merck-20C groups, respectively. Noninferiority was not shown for either GSK vaccine (lower 97.5% confidence intervals <-15%). Geometric mean concentration ratios for anti-varicella-zoster virus demonstrated noninferiority (lower 97.5% confidence interval ≥ 0.5) versus Merck-20C for GSK-20C only. Geometric mean concentration ratios for antibodies to HAV and to PCV7 pneumococcal serotypes also met criteria for noninferiority for both GSK groups compared with Merck-20C. GSK vaccine safety was observed comparable to Merck-20C. Localized but not generalized measles/rubella-like rash and grade 3 fever was reported slightly more frequently with GSK vaccines, but antipyretic use was similar. The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 serious adverse event was 2.0%, 2.9% and 1.8% in the GSK+4C, GSK-20C and Merck-20C groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Noninferiority of both GSK measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccines versus Merck-20C was demonstrated for responses to measles, mumps and rubella viruses but was not fully demonstrated for varicella-zoster virus.

Albeit the prognosis in general is good, the incidence of varicella-related hospitalization is about 6 per 100,000 in all children between 0-15 years of age, affecting mainly previously healthy children. Especially young children under the age of 5 are at risk with highest rates among children younger than one year. The most common complications are secondary bacterial infections, neurological and respiratory complications. Two cases of life threatening secondary bacterial infection are presented. One child suffered from a Toxic Shock Syndrome caused by group A streptococcus along with large necrotizing skin lesions. The second child nearly lost her left eye due to a deep orbital abscess. Both children survived without severe sequelae but had to undergo several procedures of plastic surgery. Implementation of the varicella vaccination program in the USA has shown a near elimination of deaths due to severe varicella complications. The initiation of the varicella vaccination program for children until the age of 2 in Austria should be considered to prevent complications and deaths caused by varicella.","['Resch E', 'Ihm U', 'Haslinger V', 'Wagner T', 'Kurz H']",2012,162,07월 08일,Wien Med Wochenschr,"Resch E, et al.

22612376,Prior varicella zoster virus exposure in IBD patients treated by anti-TNFs and other immunomodulators: implications for serological testing and vaccination guidelines.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a severe and preventable infection in immunosuppressed IBD patients. ECCO guidelines recommend VZV immunisation in patients with negative VZV exposure history. The value of patient-reported VZV exposure history for prediction of seropositivity in IBD patients remains unknown. Moreover, data on VZV immunity in adult IBD patients or accuracy of VZV serological testing under immunomodulator treatment is sparse.
AIMS: The primary aim was to determine the prevalence of seropositivity for VZV-IgG in immunomodulator-treated IBD patients. A secondary aim was to establish the value of patient-reported history of past VZV infection for prediction of immunity, to validate the current vaccination strategy.
METHODS: History of VZV-related illness was accessed by epidemiological questionnaire, and serological testing for VZV-IgG was performed. Serum anti-TNF medications levels were measured when applicable.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty one IBD (86% Crohn's disease, mean age 37 ± 12.8) patients were included in the study. Immunomodulator therapy was received by 87% (anti-TNFs- 71%) of the patients. Previous exposure to VZV was reported by 104 patients, and 97/104 (93%) were VZV-IgG seropositive. Seventeen patients, all seropositive, reported negative exposure history. The calculated positive and negative predictive values for the reported history of VZV exposure were 93% and 0% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Negative history of VZV exposure is a poor predictor of seronegativity. History-positive patients may still be seronegative and exposed to VZV infection. We suggest serological testing of all IBD patients with subsequent immunisation of the seronegative patients before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy.","['Kopylov U', 'Levin A', 'Mendelson E', 'Dovrat S', 'Book M', 'Eliakim R', 'Ben-Horin S']",2012,36,2,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,"Kopylov U, et al.

We further searched for correlations between seroreactivities to EBV, HSV, and VZV, and levels of mannan-binding lectin (MBL), and MBL-associated serine protease 3. We found no such correlations. Our results are in accord with recent reports of increased seroreactivity to EBV EBNA-1, and to VZV in active MS, and they support that the herpesviruses EBV and VZV together with HERV-H/HERV-W and the antiviral immune response may play a role in MS development.","['Petersen T', 'Møller-Larsen A', 'Ellermann-Eriksen S', 'Thiel S', 'Christensen T']",2012,249,01월 02일,J Neuroimmunol,"Petersen T, et al.

METHODS: We prospectively recruited 139 IBD outpatients. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used as the serological tests for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella zoster. We defined anti-rubella IgG < 10 IU/mL, anti-measles IgG < 16 IU/mL, and anti-mumps/varicella zoster IgG <4 IU/mL as seronegative for viruses. We also asked participants about past immunizations against or infections with measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella zoster viruses.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients with seronegative levels of antibodies specific for varicella zoster, rubella, measles, and mumps viruses was 5%, 30%, 34%, and 37%, respectively. Approximately 40% of the IBD patients did not remember whether they had previously been infected with any of the viruses, and almost one-third of the patients could not remember whether they had previously been vaccinated. Almost 30% of the patients with a past history of rubella or measles did not have seropositive antibody levels. A total of 54% of the patients being treated with immunosuppressant displayed seronegative levels of antibodies specific for at least one of the viruses.
CONCLUSIONS: Many IBD patients were unaware of whether they had previously been vaccinated against or infected with the viruses causing varicella zoster, rubella, measles, or mumps. Therefore, measuring the current levels of antibodies specific for such viruses is useful for determining whether patients have seropositive antibody levels before immunomodulators/biologics are used for therapy.","['Naganuma M', 'Nagahori M', 'Fujii T', 'Morio J', 'Saito E', 'Watanabe M']",2013,19,2,Inflamm Bowel Dis,"Naganuma M, et al.

New information pertaining to Orthopoxvirus (OPV) persistence in nature would significantly improve surveillance and control programs. In a recent investigation of a Camelpox virus (CMLV) outbreak in Eastern Saudi Arabia, atypical minute pox-like skin lesions (AMPL) persisted on 42.9% of convalescent camels (8.8% of herd) for more than a year after the onset of clinical signs. In order to investigate whether AMPL were related to CMLV infection, AMPL homogenates were inoculated on the chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonating chicken eggs (ECE). Live CMLV was recovered from AMPL homogenates. The sequences of the ATIP gene of viruses isolated in the beginning of the outbreak, and one year later from AMPL were identical, and similar to the Kazakhstan isolate CMLV M-96. Virus identity was confirmed by sequence analysis of the CMLV A33R, A27L, B5R, and L1R orthologue genes. Uninfected adult camels that came in contact with animals showing AMPL became infected within two weeks. Since AMPL were easily missed by veterinarians and camel drivers, it was concluded that CMLV survival in persistent skin lesions may be a key mechanism in maintaining the virus in previously infected camel herds during inter-epizootic periods.","['Yousif AA', 'Al-Naeem AA']",2012,159,03월 04일,Vet Microbiol,Yousif AA and Al-Naeem AA.

22592262,Inhibition of integrin α6 expression by cell-free varicella-zoster virus.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. VZV is released from infected cells during natural infection, but remains highly cell-associated during experimental infection, and so most studies have utilized cell-associated infection models. We examined the impact of cell-free VZV infection of primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) on the receptor integrin α6 (ITGA6). qPCR and flow cytometry demonstrated that both cell-free VZV and cell-free UV-inactivated VZV downregulated transcription and cell-surface protein expression of ITGA6. To establish whether ITGA6 altered VZV infection, VZV transcripts and nuclear DNA levels were measured in HFFs treated with ITGA6 blocking antibody before infection. ITGA6 blocking did not impair virus entry but did negatively impact VZV transcription, and this effect was virus specific as transcription of the related herpes simplex virus type 1 was not similarly inhibited. This study identifies modulation of ITGA6 during cell-free VZV infection, and provides the first evidence linking ITGA6 with post-entry productive VZV gene expression.","['Bowles JB', 'Steain M', 'Slobedman B', 'Abendroth A']",2012,93,Pt 8,J Gen Virol,"Bowles JB, et al.

22589254,Safety and efficacy of etanercept in a cohort of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis under 4 years of age.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of etanercept in a cohort of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) under 4 years of age.
METHODS: Data were collected at every visit during treatment with etanercept in 25 children who began treatment at a mean age of 3 years (range 18-48 months). Safety endpoints included the incidence of any adverse events. Efficacy endpoints included the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30, 50, and 70 criteria for improvement.
RESULTS: Data from 25 patients with JIA treated with etanercept for a mean period of 23 months were analyzed. All patients received concomitant medications: 24 methotrexate, 3 cyclosporin A, and 10 corticosteroids. After the first 6 months of treatment, 15 (71.4%) patients achieved an ACR Pedi30 response and at the last observation 20 (80%) achieved ACR Pedi30. ACR Pedi50 and 70 responses were, respectively, 62% and 43% at 6 months and 72% and 64% at the last followup. Five patients (20%) discontinued etanercept for lack of efficacy. Two (8%) developed adverse events, both primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections (both not vaccinated). One was hospitalized because of a necrotizing fasciitis secondary to VZV infection. No cases of tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, or malignancies were reported.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort of patients etanercept proved to be safe and efficacious in the majority of children. The response in toddlers was similar to that in older children. We observed only 1 case of severe infection that required hospitalization and stopped treatment temporarily.","['Bracaglia C', 'Buonuomo PS', 'Tozzi AE', 'Pardeo M', 'Nicolai R', 'Campana A', 'Insalaco A', 'Cortis E', 'DE Benedetti F']",2012,39,6,J Rheumatol,"Bracaglia C, et al.

22574722,Epidemiological characteristics and societal burden of varicella zoster virus in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella and herpes zoster are both caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection or reactivation and may lead to complications associated with a (severe) societal burden. Because the epidemiology of VZV-related diseases in the Netherlands remains largely unknown or incomplete, the main objective of this study was to study the primary care incidence, associated complications and health care resource use.
METHODS: We investigated the incidence of VZV complications in the Dutch general practitioner (GP) practices and pharmacies in a retrospective population-based cohort study (2004-2008) based on longitudinal GP data including free text fields, hospital referral and discharge letters from approximately 165,000 patients.
RESULTS: The average annual incidence of varicella GP-consultations was 51.5 per 10,000 (95% CI 44.4-58.7) overall; 465.5 per 10,000 for 0-1 year-olds; 610.8 per 10,000 for 1-4 year-olds; 153.5 per 10,000 for 5-9 year-olds; 8,3 per 10,000 for >10 year olds. When only ICPC coded diagnoses were analyzed the incidence was 27% lower. The proportion of complications among varicella patients was 34.9%. Most frequently complications were upper respiratory tract infections. Almost half of the varicella patients received medication. The referral rate based on GP consultations was 1.7%. The average annual incidence of herpes zoster GP-consultations was 47.5 per 10,000 (95% CI 40.6-54.4). The incidence increased with age; 32.8 per 10,000 for <60 year-olds; 93.1 per 10,000 for 60-64 year-olds and 113.2 per 10,000 for >65 year olds. When estimating herpes zoster incidence only on ICPC coded information, the incidence was 28% lower. The complication rate of herpes zoster was 32.9%. Post herpetic neuralgia was seen most often. Of patients diagnosed with herpes zoster 67.8% received medication. The referral rate based on GP consultations was 3.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: For varicella the highest incidence of GP-consultations was found in 1-4 year-olds, for herpes zoster in the >65 years olds. The occurrence of complications was not age-dependent but varies per complication. When estimating incidence of VZV-related diseases in primary care, based on diagnostic codes only, one should be aware of a gross underestimation of the incidence. Our analysis may have important implications for the outcomes of upcoming cost-effectiveness analyses on VZV vaccination.","['Pierik JG', 'Gumbs PD', 'Fortanier SA', 'Van Steenwijk PC', 'Postma MJ']",2012,12,,BMC Infect Dis,"Pierik JG, et al.

22564884,Features of varicella zoster virus myelitis and dependence on immune status.,"BACKGROUND: Myelitis is a rare complication of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection and is more prevalent in immunocompromised individuals. Clinical features, outcomes, and presentations vary. The aim of the current study was to compare the clinical presentations of our patients with those reported in the literature, and to evaluate the differences in clinical features between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.
METHODS: A review of the literature on VZV myelitis was carried out by searching PUBMED from 1980 to 2012. Clinical features of our cases and those in the literature were compared.
RESULTS: There were 5 cases at our hospital and 26 were reported in the literature. Seventeen patients were immunocompromised (54.8%), and most had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Typical presentations (skin lesions followed by myelopathy at the corresponding level) were observed in 14 patients (45.2%). The immunocompromised patients were prone to atypical presentations (p<0.05). Outcomes were good in immunocompetent patients and relatively poor in immunocompromised patients (p<0.05). Anti-herpetic agents had no statistically significant effect on outcomes in immunocompromised patients (p=0.280), but could reduce mortality rate in AIDS patients (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Immunocompromised individuals are susceptible to this disease, and prone to atypical presentations and poorer outcomes. Timely recognition and anti-herpes therapy may be beneficial to the outcomes. In the AIDS patients, anti-herpes therapy can reduce mortality effectively.","['Hung CH', 'Chang KH', 'Kuo HC', 'Huang CC', 'Liao MF', 'Tsai YT', 'Ro LS']",2012,318,01월 02일,J Neurol Sci,"Hung CH, et al.

22555234,Musculoskeletal sequelae of Varicella-zoster infection: two case reports.,"Varicella-zoster is a common paediatric viral infection that usually runs a benign self-limiting course but has a risk of complications. The most common sequelae are bacterial skin infections, which are usually mild. However, bacteraemia/septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, pneumonia, ataxia, encephalitis and purpura fulminans are also possible. Although rare, musculoskeletal sequelae (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pyomyositis and necrotizing fasciitis) can occur in otherwise healthy children. These latter complications are potentially life- and limb-threatening and must be considered in a child post-varicella with pain in a limb or joint. We describe two patients who had musculoskeletal complications after varicella: (1) a 16-month-old boy who developed pyomyositis of the thigh and septic arthritis of the hip and (2) a two-year-seven-month-old girl who developed septic arthritis of the hip and knee and a 'bare area' subperiosteal abscess of the femur. Their clinical presentations, detailed management plans and outcomes are reported. These cases highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis, appropriate investigation (including the important role of magnetic resonance imaging) and surgery when an otherwise healthy post-varicella child deteriorates.","['Lim JB', 'Huntley JS']",2012,57,2,Scott Med J,Lim JB and Huntley JS.

It has also been temporally associated with immunization, but has not been previously described following two different live attenuated vaccines.
CASE PRESENTATION: A case is presented of a 12 month old Caucasian boy with recurrent benign 6th nerve palsy following measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines, given on separate occasions with complete recovery following each episode. No alternate underlying etiology was identified despite extensive investigations and review.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of benign 6th nerve palsies do not have a sinister cause and have an excellent prognosis, with recovery expected in most cases. The exact pathophysiology is unknown, although hypotheses including autoimmune mechanisms and direct viral invasion could explain the pathophysiology behind immunization related nerve palsies. It is important to rule out other aetiologies with thorough history, physical examination and investigations. There is limited information in the literature regarding the safety of a repeat dose of a live vaccine in this setting.

22544677,Immunohistochemical detection of intra-neuronal VZV proteins in snap-frozen human ganglia is confounded by antibodies directed against blood group A1-associated antigens.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox, establishes latency in trigeminal (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and can lead to herpes zoster upon reactivation. The VZV proteome expressed during latency remains ill-defined, and previous studies have shown discordant data on the spectrum and expression pattern of VZV proteins and transcripts in latently infected human ganglia. Recently, Zerboni and colleagues have provided new insight into this discrepancy (Zerboni et al. in J Virol 86:578-583, 2012). They showed that VZV-specific ascites-derived monoclonal antibody (mAb) preparations contain endogenous antibodies directed against blood group A1 proteins, resulting in false-positive intra-neuronal VZV staining in formalin-fixed human DRG. The aim of the present study was to confirm and extend this phenomenon to snap-frozen TG (n=30) and DRG (n=9) specimens of blood group genotyped donors (n=30). The number of immunohistochemically stained neurons was higher with mAb directed to immediate early protein 62 (IE62) compared with IE63. The IE63 mAb-positive neurons always co-stained for IE62 but not vice versa. The mAb staining was confined to distinct large intra-neuronal vacuoles and restricted to A1(POS) donors. Anti-VZV mAb staining in neurons, but not in VZV-infected cell monolayers, was obliterated after mAb adsorption against blood group A1 erythrocytes. The data presented demonstrate that neuronal VZV protein expression detected by ascites-derived mAb in snap-frozen TG and DRG of blood group A1(POS) donors can be misinterpreted due to the presence of endogenous antibodies directed against blood group A1-associated antigens present in ascites-derived VZV-specific mAb preparations.","['Ouwendijk WJ', 'Flowerdew SE', 'Wick D', 'Horn AK', 'Sinicina I', 'Strupp M', 'Osterhaus AD', 'Verjans GM', 'Hüfner K']",2012,18,3,J Neurovirol,"Ouwendijk WJ, et al.

The HCWs were also screened for measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella (MMRV) using serological methods. One thousand two hundred and fifty-five HCWs were tested. Of the HCWs examined, 94% were immune to measles, 97% to rubella, 90% to mumps and 98% to varicella. The positive predictive values of histories of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella were 96%, 93%, 100% and 98%, respectively. The negative predictive values of histories of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella were 13%, 17%, 5% and 2%, respectively. The cost of vaccination without screening was significantly more expensive (cost difference: €24,385) for varicella, although vaccination without screening was cheap (cost difference: €5693) for MMR. Although the use of cheaper vaccines supports the implementation of vaccination programs without screening, the cost of vaccination should not be calculated based only on the direct costs. The indirect costs associated with lost work time due to vaccination and its side effects and the direct costs of potential side effects should be considered. However, if prescreening is not conducted, some HCWs (2-7%) would be unprotected against these contagious illnesses because of the unreliability of their MMRV history. In conclusion, the screening of HCWs before vaccination continues to be advisable.","['Alp E', 'Cevahir F', 'Gökahmetoglu S', 'Demiraslan H', 'Doganay M']",2012,5,2,J Infect Public Health,"Alp E, et al.

The risks for the fetus and neonate depend on the timing. When varicella occurs around delivery, it often leads to disseminated neonatal varicella. When varicella occurs during pregnancy, transmission can occur, but is usually asymptomatic; some infants develop zoster postnatally and a few have FVS. Before 20 weeks' gestation, FVS can occur, with an incidence of about 1%. The lesions can affect the skin, limbs, central and autonomous nervous systems, eyes, cause calcifications, and growth retardation; mortality is high. Lesions typically follow one or several nerve territories, suggesting that damage results from in utero zoster following primary fetal infection. There has been little study of prenatal diagnosis of FVS. Serial ultrasound examination can detect various anomalies, magnetic resonance imaging can be of use to investigate for microphthamia and cerebral lesions, and amniocentesis can diagnose viral transmission.

Although chickenpox is no longer a ubiquitous childhood infection, varicella-zoster virus continues to circulate in the community and nonimmune pregnant women remain at risk. Varicella can cause severe infection in pregnant women, often complicated by viral pneumonia. Maternal varicella occurring in the first half of pregnancy can cause the rare but devastating congenital varicella syndrome, whereas infection in the late stages of pregnancy may cause neonatal varicella.

As infants are recommended to receive multiple vaccines during a single office visit, this phase 3 study assessed the safety and immune response to MenACWY-CRM at alternative visits in older infants and concomitant use with measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine (MMRV) at 12 months of age.
METHODS: Two age groups were concurrently enrolled: 7- to 9-month-old infants who received 2 doses of MenACWY-CRM at 7-9 and 12 months and were randomized 1:1 to receive MenACWY-CRM with or without MMRV at 12 months, and 12-month-old infants who received MMRV only at 12 months. Using predefined non-inferiority criteria, immune responses to the antigens in MMRV were compared between those who did and did not receive MenACWY-CRM; immune responses to MenACWY-CRM as measured by the percentage of subjects with human serum bactericidal activity (hSBA) titers ≥ 8, were compared between those who did and did not receive concomitant MMRV. Adequacy of the immune response to 2 doses of MenACWY-CRM administered at 7-9 and 12 months was also assessed. Local and systemic reactions, adverse events resulting in withdrawal or requiring medical attention and serious adverse events were monitored.
RESULTS: Concomitant administration of MMRV with MenACWY-CRM did not affect the immune response to either vaccine. The 2-dose series of MenACWY-CRM induced adequate immune response to all 4 serogroups. No increased reactogenicity was observed with MenACWY-CRM+MMRV compared with MMRV alone, and there were no study-related serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant administration of MenACWY-CRM with MMRV vaccinations at 12 months was well-tolerated, without safety concerns. Robust immune responses to all components of both vaccines were produced and all criteria for non-inferiority were met, supporting the use of a 2-dose regimen of MenACWY-CRM in this age group.","['Klein NP', 'Shepard J', 'Bedell L', 'Odrljin T', 'Dull P']",2012,30,26,Vaccine,"Klein NP, et al.

Although there have been few reports of life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis following varicella in western countries, it is rare in China. Usually patients with varicella were admitted to pediatric or infectious disease department but not surgical departments; so that the clinicians should be aware that varicella may be complicated by life-threatening surgical infections. Necrotizing fasciitis should be suspected in patients of varicella who showed an increasing pain and swelling in any body areas associated with increasing fever and local erythema.

METHODS: According to ""China Information System for Diseases Control and Prevention"", the reported clinical diagnosis varicella cases were tracked in kindergartens, primary and secondary schools whose onset date were from 2008 to 2010. Epidemiological survey was conducted and epidemiological features were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 21 474 varicella cases were investigated: 55.3% (11 883 cases) had been vaccinated by varicella vaccine. Of cases with definite immunization history, interval between vaccination date and onset date were from 30 days to 1 year accounted for 3.4% (286/8510), 1 to 3 years accounted for 18.2% (1551/8510), 3 to 5 years accounted for 28.6% (2431/8510), 5 to 10 years accounted for 34.3% (2916/8510) (left-closed right-open interval); The peak age of onset was 4 years old in cases without immunization history, which was 6 years old in cases with immunization history; The proportion of cases with immunization history (≥ 30 days) had increased from 42.4% (2862/6754) in 2008 to 56.3% (4327/7679) in 2010.

22483494,Varicella zoster virus disease after pediatric living donor liver transplantation: is it serious?,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate patients who developed varicella zoster virus (VZV) disease after pediatric living donor liver transplantation (PLDLT).
METHODS: Two hundred fifty-five patients who underwent PLDLT between 1995 and 2010 were included in this study. Pretransplantation vaccination of VZV was performed for all recipients except emergency PLDLTs. Posttransplantation VZV vaccination was administered to the patients with a low VZV antibody titer 2 years or more after transplantation. The clinical course and outcomes of VZV disease in cases were reviewed with the transplant database and hospital medical records.
RESULTS: Sixty-three patients developed VZV disease (chicken pox in 61, herpes zoster in 2) at a median onset of 36 months after PLDLT and at a median age of 4 years old, with a cumulative incidence of 25%. All chicken pox occurred in VZV antibody-negative patients. The onset of herpes zoster in the two patients occurred within 3 months after PLDLT; in addition, these patients were VZV antibody-positive patients. The clinical presentations of most patients were not serious and there were no disseminated infections. Although only 3 patients (5%) were hospitalized, the other 60 patients (95%) all showed a good response to oral antiviral therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Although VZV disease is an infectious disease with a high morbidity rate after PLDLT, it can normally be successfully managed on an outpatient basis at home. Pre- and posttransplantation vaccinations are effective for delaying the onset of chicken pox after PLDLT and to prevent it from developing into a serious illness.","['Mizuta K', 'Urahashi T', 'Ihara Y', 'Sanada Y', 'Wakiya T', 'Yamada N', 'Okada N', 'Egami S', 'Kawarasaki H']",2012,44,3,Transplant Proc,"Mizuta K, et al.

Among 1- to 2-year-olds, the risk of febrile seizures 7 to 10 days after MMRV is double that after separate MMR + V. Whether MMRV or MMR + V affects risk for febrile seizure risk among 4- to 6-year-olds has not been reported.
METHODS: Among 4- to 6-year-old Vaccine Safety Datalink members, we identified seizures in the emergency department and hospital from 2000 to 2008 and outpatient visits for fever from 2006 to 2008 during days 7 to 10 and 0 to 42 after MMRV and MMR + V. Incorporating medical record reviews, we assessed seizure risk after MMRV and MMR + V.
RESULTS: From 2006 through 2008, 86 750 children received MMRV; from 2000 through 2008, 67 438 received same-day MMR + V. Seizures were rare throughout days 0 to 42 without peaking during days 7 to 10. There was 1 febrile seizure 7 to 10 days after MMRV and 0 after MMR + V. Febrile seizure risk was 1 per 86 750 MMRV doses (95% confidence interval, 1 per 3 426 441, 1 per 15 570) and 0 per 67 438 MMR + V doses (1 per 18 282).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides reassurance that MMRV and MMR + V were not associated with increased risk of febrile seizures among 4- to 6-year-olds. We can rule out with 95% confidence a risk greater than 1 febrile seizure per 15 500 MMRV doses and 1 per 18 000 MMR + V doses.","['Klein NP', 'Lewis E', 'Baxter R', 'Weintraub E', 'Glanz J', 'Naleway A', 'Jackson LA', 'Nordin J', 'Lieu T', 'Belongia EA', 'Fireman B']",2012,129,5,Pediatrics,"Klein NP, et al.

METHODS: A total of 67,977 children of 4-6 years (51% male, 50% Hispanic) were included in this retrospective cohort study. The second-dose varicella vaccination history was evaluated by using the Kaiser Immunization Tracking System. Correlation and multivariable regression analyses were used to test the association between potential correlates and nonadherence to the second-dose varicella vaccination.
RESULTS: Four-year-old children had a significantly higher vaccination rate (76.1%) than 5-year-olds (43.2%) and 6-year-olds (17.3%) by 12 months after the implementation of routine second-dose varicella vaccination. Non-Hispanic white race [rate ratio (RR): 1.13 (95% CI: 1.11-1.15)], living in an area of >75% adults with a high-school diploma [RR: 1.17 (95% CI: 1.14-1.20)], and having a primary care provider specializing in family medicine [RR: 1.15 (95% CI: 1.11-1.18)] significantly correlated with nonadherence. Missed opportunity was found in 59.7% (n=20,465) of children who did not receive the second-dose varicella vaccine in spite of at least 1 outpatient visit and in 15.8% (n=5407) who received some other vaccines during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts targeting non-Hispanic white and black children, parents with a high education level and family medicine physicians might improve uptake of the routine 2-dose varicella vaccination.

22459783,Childhood infections and the risk of asthma: a longitudinal study over 37 years.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined common childhood infections and adult asthma. We examined associations between childhood infectious diseases, childhood pneumonia, and current, persisting, and incident asthma to middle age.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS). A history of pneumonia was ascertained from their parents when the TAHS participants were 7 years old. Measles, rubella, mumps, chickenpox, diphtheria, and pertussis were identified from school medical records. Associations with current, persisting, or incident asthma were examined using regression techniques.
RESULTS: Greater infectious diseases load was negatively associated with persisting asthma at all ages. Individually, pertussis (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-1.00) was negatively associated with asthma persisting to age 13 years, chickenpox (aOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.88) was negatively associated with asthma persisting to age 32 years, and rubella was negatively associated with asthma persisting to ages 32 (aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.31-0.96) and 44 years (aOR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35-0.82). Pertussis was associated with preadolescent incident asthma (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.80; 95% CI, 1.10-2.96), whereas measles was associated with adolescent incident asthma (aHR, 1.66; 1.06-2.56). Childhood pneumonia was associated with current asthma at ages 7 (aOR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.61-3.75) and 13 years (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.00-1.75), an association stronger in those without than those with eczema (aOR, 3.46; 95% CI, 2.83-4.24 vs aOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.38-3.12).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, childhood infectious diseases protected against asthma persisting in later life, but pertussis and measles were associated with new-onset asthma after childhood. Measles and pertussis immunization might lead to a reduction in incident asthma in later life.","['Burgess JA', 'Abramson MJ', 'Gurrin LC', 'Byrnes GB', 'Matheson MC', 'May CL', 'Giles GG', 'Johns DP', 'Hopper JL', 'Walters EH', 'Dharmage SC']",2012,142,3,Chest,"Burgess JA, et al.

22454467,Transmission of varicella zoster virus from individuals with herpes zoster or varicella in school and day care settings.,"BACKGROUND: Because the varicella incidence has declined following varicella vaccine licensure, herpes zoster (HZ) cases may play a larger role in varicella zoster virus (VZV) transmission. We investigated how HZ and varicella cases contribute to the varicella incidence in schools and day care centers.
METHODS: Surveillance data collected in Philadelphia during September 2003-June 2010 were analyzed. A varicella case was considered to be sporadic if it was reported from a school or day care facility >6 weeks after or ≥10 days before other reports of VZV transmission. A varicella case was considered to be secondary if it occurred 10-21 days after report of a case of HZ or sporadic varicella. Analysis compared VZV transmission from individuals with HZ or sporadic varicella, stratified by varicella vaccination status and disease severity.
RESULTS: Of 290 HZ cases reported, 27 (9%) resulted in 84 secondary varicella cases. Of 1358 sporadic varicella cases reported, 205 (15%) resulted in 564 secondary varicella cases. Approximately half of the HZ and sporadic varicella cases resulted in single secondary cases. The proportion of individuals who had secondary cases with mild disease was similar for those exposed to HZ and those exposed to varicella (70% and 72%, respectively). VZV transmission was highest from unvaccinated individuals with sporadic varicella (P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: VZV transmission from individuals with HZ contributes to varicella morbidity. More research is needed to understand risk factors and guide recommendations for preventing VZV transmission from individuals with HZ.","['Viner K', 'Perella D', 'Lopez A', 'Bialek S', 'Newbern C', 'Pierre R', 'Spells N', 'Watson B']",2012,205,9,J Infect Dis,"Viner K, et al.

22442094,Multifractal signatures of infectious diseases.,"Incidence of infection time-series data for the childhood diseases measles, chicken pox, rubella and whooping cough are described in the language of multifractals. We explore the potential of using the wavelet transform maximum modulus (WTMM) method to characterize the multiscale structure of the observed time series and of simulated data generated by the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model. The singularity spectra of the observed time series suggest that each disease is characterized by a unique multifractal signature, which distinguishes that particular disease from the others. The wavelet scaling functions confirm that the time series of measles, rubella and whooping cough are clearly multifractal, while chicken pox has a more monofractal structure in time. The stochastic SEIR epidemic model is unable to reproduce the qualitative singularity structure of the reported incidence data: it is too smooth and does not appear to have a multifractal singularity structure. The precise reasons for the failure of the SEIR epidemic model to reproduce the correct multiscale structure of the reported incidence data remain unclear.","['Holdsworth AM', 'Kevlahan NK', 'Earn DJ']",2012,9,74,J R Soc Interface,"Holdsworth AM, et al.

22434654,Varicella zoster virus infection in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND: The risk of viral infection is increased in immunosuppressed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is of particular interest in IBD because of a number of reports of severe, disseminated, and occasionally fatal varicella infection in immunosuppressed IBD patients.
METHODS: We reviewed publications describing VZV infection in IBD patients and combined these data with a review of the current literature relating to both primary and secondary varicella in IBD.
RESULTS: Twenty cases of primary varicella infection and 32 cases of herpes zoster infection have been reported in IBD. Additional cases are reported in clinical trials. The risk of VZV infection is increased with all immunosuppressants used in IBD, but corticosteroids and combination immunosuppression appear to be a particular risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers need to be aware of the various manifestations of primary and secondary VZV infection in immunosuppressed IBD patients. Patients should be screened for VZV immunity and vaccinated prior to commencing immunosuppression.","['Cullen G', 'Baden RP', 'Cheifetz AS']",2012,18,12,Inflamm Bowel Dis,"Cullen G, et al.

22426372,Evaluation of the establishment of herd immunity in the population by means of serological surveys and vaccination coverage.,"The necessary herd immunity blocking the transmission of an infectious agent in the population is established when the prevalence of protected individuals is higher than a critical value, called the herd immunity threshold. The establishment of herd immunity in the population can be determined using the vaccination coverage and seroepidemiological surveys. The vaccination coverage associated with herd immunity (V(c)) can be determined from the herd immunity threshold and vaccine effectiveness. This method requires a vaccine-specific effectiveness evaluation, and it can be used only for the herd immunity assessment of vaccinated communities in which the infectious agent is not circulating. The prevalence of positive serological results associated with herd immunity can be determined from the herd immunity threshold, in terms of prevalence of antibodies (p(c)) and serological test performance. The herd immunity is established when the prevalence of antibodies is higher than pc. This method can be used to assess the establishment of herd immunity in different population groups, both when the infectious agent is circulating and when it is not possible to assess vaccine effectiveness. The herd immunity assessment in Catalonia, Spain, showed that the additional vaccination coverage required to establish herd immunity was 3-6% for measles, mump and varicella and 11% poliovirus type III in school children, 17-59% for diphtheria in youth and adults and 25-46% for persussis in school children, youth and adults.",['Plans-Rubió P'],2012,8,2,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Plans-Rubió P.

Eight weeks prior to this presentation he had had varicella zoster affecting his right S1 dermatome. CD4 count was 355 cells/mm(3) and he was antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive. Power was 0/5 proximally and 4/5 distally in the upper limbs. Reflexes were absent and there was sensory loss in the C5, C6 and T1 dermatomes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed a lymphocytosis with low glucose; however, CSF Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction (HSV PCR) were negative as was syphilis serology. Electromyography showed marked motor axonal loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any cervical spinal lesion. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR was positive in the CSF. He was treated with high-dose intravenous aciclovir with good resolution of his syndrome over time and was commenced on ART. We believe this to be the first case report of varicella reactivation causing bilateral neuralgic amyotrophy in an HIV-positive patient.","['McNamara P', 'Kiely BM', 'Zekan S', 'Redmond J', 'Mulcahy F']",2012,23,2,Int J STD AIDS,"McNamara P, et al.

22409242,Common skin conditions in children with HIV/AIDS.,"The most recent Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) data inform us that approximately 2.3 million children were infected with HIV at the end of 2009. The greatest burden of this infection is thrust squarely on the most impoverished healthcare systems in the world. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to at least 68% of the global total of HIV infection of 22.5 million. Although a scale up of antiretrovirals has been one of the UNAIDS priorities, and access to services to prevent mother-to-child transmission has increased, an estimated 370,000 children were newly infected in 2009. Hence, infected mothers continue giving birth to HIV-infected children who require appropriate healthcare to diagnose and treat their underlying immunodeficiency and related disorders. Skin lesions are common in these children as they present with infections common in the general population, albeit more severe. Those lesions that are markers of HIV or AIDS are important signs heralding an improving or declining immune system and the success of antiretrovirals. Cutaneous manifestations of HIV/AIDS can be classified broadly as infections and infestations, inflammatory conditions, tumors, and antiretroviral related. This manuscript discusses the more common skin conditions seen in children infected with HIV so as to improve the diagnosis and therapy administered by healthcare professionals especially in sub-Saharan Africa.","['Mankahla A', 'Mosam A']",2012,13,3,Am J Clin Dermatol,Mankahla A and Mosam A.

22408704,Incidence of vesicobullous and erosive disorders of neonates.,"BACKGROUND: The entity vesicobullous disorders in neonates encompasses a varied spectrum of disorders varying from self limiting to potentially life threatening infectious diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the incidence of dermatoses in neonates, stress the importance of simple noninvasive diagnostic procedures with perspective to actual need of active intervention.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty four neonates with vesicobullous lesions in departments of dermatology and pediatrics were evaluated with respect to diagnosis, required treatments and follow ups.
RESULTS: Out of total 44 neonates, 29 were males and 15 females. Iinfectious dermatoses accounted for: 9% - staphylococcal pyoderma, 4,5% - Group A Streptococcal impetigo, 4,5% - neonatal tinea faciei, 2,3% - neonatal candidiasis, 2,3% - neonatal varicella/chickenpox and 2,3% - scabies. Transient skin lesions were: 41% - erythema toxicum neonatorum, 9% - milia crystallina, 6.8% - neonatal acne, 4,5% - sucking blisters, 2,3% - transient neonatal pustular melanosis, 2,3% - epidermolysis bullosa simplex, 2,3% - incontinentia pigmentii, 2,3% - eosinophilic pustular folliculitis, 2,3% - pemphigus vulgaris and 2,3% - neonatal herpes simplex.
CONCLUSIONS: Care has to be instituted to identify accurately infectious diseases and distinguish them from benign transient neonatal dermatoses. Some disorders first manifesting during the neonatal period may also represent harbingers of potential problems during adulthood. Finally, it is relevant to judge whether the treatment is required or not.","['Tarang G', 'Anupam V']",2011,5,4,J Dermatol Case Rep,Tarang G and Anupam V.

22385673,Management of varicella infection (chickenpox) in pregnancy.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the existing data regarding varicella zoster virus infection (chickenpox) in pregnancy, interventions to reduce maternal complications and fetal infection, and antepartum and peripartum management.
METHODS: The maternal and fetal outcomes in varicella zoster infection were reviewed, as well as the benefit of the different treatment modalities in altering maternal and fetal sequelae.
EVIDENCE: Medline was searched for articles and clinical guidelines published in English between January 1970 and November 2010.
VALUES: The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Recommendations for practice were ranked according to the method described in that report (Table).
RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Varicella immunization is recommended for all non-immune women as part of pre-pregnancy and postpartum care. (II-3B) 2. Varicella vaccination should not be administered in pregnancy. However, termination of pregnancy should not be advised because of inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy. (II-3D) 3. The antenatal varicella immunity status of all pregnant women should be documented by history of previous infection, varicella vaccination, or varicella zoster immunoglobulin G serology. (III-C) 4. All non-immune pregnant women should be informed of the risk of varicella infection to themselves and their fetuses. They should be instructed to seek medical help following any contact with a person who may have been contagious. (II-3B) 5. In the case of a possible exposure to varicella in a pregnant woman with unknown immune status, serum testing should be performed. If the serum results are negative or unavailable within 96 hours from exposure, varicella zoster immunoglobulin should be administered. (III-C) 6. Women who develop varicella infection in pregnancy need to be made aware of the potential adverse maternal and fetal sequelae, the risk of transmission to the fetus, and the options available for prenatal diagnosis. (II-3C) 7. Detailed ultrasound and appropriate follow-up is recommended for all women who develop varicella in pregnancy to screen for fetal consequences of infection. (III-B) 8. Women with significant (e.g., pneumonitis) varicella infection in pregnancy should be treated with oral antiviral agents (e.g., acyclovir 800 mg 5 times daily). In cases of progression to varicella pneumonitis, maternal admission to hospital should be seriously considered. Intravenous acyclovir can be considered for severe complications in pregnancy (oral forms have poor bioavailability). The dose is usually 10 to 15 mg/kg of BW or 500 mg/m² IV every 8 h for 5 to 10 days for varicella pneumonitis, and it should be started within 24 to 72 h of the onset of rash. (III-C) 9. Neonatal health care providers should be informed of peripartum varicella exposure in order to optimize early neonatal care with varicella zoster immunoglobulin and immunization. (III-C) Varicella zoster immunoglobulin should be administered to neonates whenever the onset of maternal disease is between 5 days before and 2 days after delivery.

22378912,Novel genetic variation identified at fixed loci in ORF62 of the Oka varicella vaccine and in a case of vaccine-associated herpes zoster.,"The live attenuated Oka varicella vaccine (vOka), derived from clade 2 wild-type (wt) virus pOka, is used for routine childhood immunization in several countries, including the United States, which has caused dramatic declines in the incidence of varicella. vOka can cause varicella, establish latency, and reactivate to cause herpes zoster (HZ). Three loci in varicella-zoster virus (VZV) open reading frame 62 (ORF62) (106262, 107252, and 108111) are used to distinguish vOka from wt VZV. A fourth position (105705) is also fixed for the vOka allele in nearly all vaccine batches. These 4 positions and two vOka mutations (106710 and 107599) reportedly absent from Varivax were analyzed on Varivax-derived ORF62 TOPO TA clones. The wt allele was detected at positions 105705 and 107252 on 3% and 2% of clones, respectively, but was absent at positions 106262 and 108111. Position 106710 was fixed for the wt allele, whereas the vOka allele was present on 18.4% of clones at position 107599. We also evaluated the 4 vOka markers in an isolate obtained from a case of vaccine-caused HZ. The isolate carried the vOka allele at positions 105705, 106262, and 108111. However, at position 107252, the wt allele was present. Thus, all of the ORF62 vOka markers previously regarded as fixed occur as the wt allele in a small percentage of vOka strains. Characterization of all four vOka markers in ORF62 and of the clade 2 subtype marker in ORF38 is now necessary to confirm vOka adverse events.","['Quinlivan ML', 'Jensen NJ', 'Radford KW', 'Schmid DS']",2012,50,5,J Clin Microbiol,"Quinlivan ML, et al.

She presented with an earache, severe vertigo, and vomiting at onset, and thereafter, herpes zoster oticus appeared. No facial nerve palsy was seen. She was vaccinated for varicella and had no past history of apparent varicella infection. The patient showed positive IgG and negative IgM serum antibodies for varicella-zoster virus (VZV). An analysis of VZV-DNA from the patient's ear lesion using alleric discrimination real-time PCR identified a wild-type strain of VZV. We diagnosed her to have atypical Ramsay-Hunt syndrome caused by reactivation of the VZV. Aciclovir and prednisolone were administered, and she recovered completely. This case indicates that Ramsay-Hunt syndrome could be caused by a VZV infection after vaccination, even though its frequency is low.

22346239,Spectrum of Guillain-Barré syndrome in tertiary care hospital at Kolkata.,"OBJECTIVE: In childhood Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the clinical profiles using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in addition to supportive care were studied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 139 children with severe GBS admitted to our respiratory care unit managed with the IVIg as an adjunct intervention to conventional supportive and respiratory care.
RESULTS: In our case series of 139 cases, motor weakness was the most common presenting feature. Antecedent illness was found in 66.7% of cases in the preceding two weeks, which included nonspecific illness, acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, and chickenpox. At onset, sensory symptoms (pain and paresthesia) were noted in 59% of the cases and limb weakness in 77%. On admission, a majority (61.54%) were in Hughes neurological disability grading stage V; all had limb weakness at the peak deficit, autonomic disturbance was seen in 35.8%, and bulbar palsy in 52%. Duration of illness was less than three weeks in 67% of cases. The mean duration of ventilation was 21.5 days (range, 5-60 days).
CONCLUSIONS: Male preponderance and motor weakness was the most common presenting illness and a majority achieved full recovery in our series. Although IVIg may be useful in the treatment of GBS, the key issue is excellent intensive care unit management.","['Sarkar UK', 'Menon L', 'Sarbapalli D', 'Pal R', 'Zaman FA', 'Kar S', 'Singh J', 'Mondal M', 'Mukherjee S']",2011,2,2,J Nat Sci Biol Med,"Sarkar UK, et al.

22336652,Genotyping of varicella-zoster virus (vzv) wild-type strains isolated in the Czech Republic.,"OBJECTIVES: Monitoring of the varicella-zoster virus is becoming an important tool for analysis of the circulation of individual strains of VZV which differ not only at the genomic level, but show a variability in their clinical and epidemiological characteristics. Such data are not available on a large scale from the Czech population and could help understanding the epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of the virus, as well as its potential for reinfection and increased pathogenesis in the population groups at higher risk for complications. The main aim of this study was detection and monitoring of wild-type or vaccine VZV strain isolates in the region of Eastern Bohemia and genotypic characterization of these isolates.
MATERIAL: A total of 273 clinical samples were obtained from patients exhibiting symptoms of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection manifested as chickenpox or herpes zoster (HZ) treated in the Faculty Hospital of Charles University, Medical School in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.
METHODS: Characterization of individual short VZV DNA sequences was performed utilizing restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), PCR and sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in open reading frames (ORF) 21, 22 and 50 were used to identify individual VZV strains.
RESULTS: All clinical isolates (97 from varicella, 176 from herpes zoster) were VZV positive wild-type strains. Sequencing analysis showed that 89 isolates were of the European E1 genotype, 180 were of the European E2 genotype and 2 were identified as the Mosaic M1 strain. In addition, for the first time in this region two unusual genotypes were identified, both representing a combination of E1 and M2 strain specific SNPs.
CONCLUSION: Our prospective VZV genotyping study which is the first to monitor the VZV epidemiological situation in the Czech Republic using such a large set of clinical specimens, has provided valuable epidemiological data and identified two unique VZV recombinants.","['Bostikova V', 'Salavec M', 'Smetana J', 'Chlibek R', 'Kosina P', 'Prasil P', 'Plisek S', 'Splino M', 'Bostik P']",2011,155,4,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Bostikova V, et al.

This case report aimed to describe the sonographic features of congenital varicella syndrome following maternal varicella. Well-documented maternal chicken pox was made at 12 weeks of gestation and prenatal ultrasound was performed at 16 weeks. Striking sonographic features included hydropic changes and disseminated calcifications in multiple organs, especially liver and myocardium. Elective termination of pregnancy was done at 17 weeks. The presence of disseminated calcifications could suggest the diagnosis of congenital varicella syndrome.","['Tongsong T', 'Srisupundit K', 'Traisrisilp K']",2012,40,3,J Clin Ultrasound,"Tongsong T, et al.

22312999,Outbreak of cutaneous form of poxvirus on a commercial turkey farm caused by the species fowlpox.,"The present report documents the occurrence of a poxvirus infection in commercial meat turkeys. The affected farm had six flocks, with a total of 11,680 birds at different ages; birds from two of these flocks were affected. The clinical picture was characterized by severe epithelial lesions and proliferations on the head and neck regions as reported for the cutaneous form of poxvirus infection. Except for these lesions, no adverse clinical signs or gross pathologic lesions were observed. Only a low number of birds was affected (n = 20) and no increase of mortality could be seen. Bacteriologic investigations from the lesions revealed multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus. Eosinophilic inclusions (Bollinger bodies) in histologic examinations in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes were noticeable. Typical pox virions were demonstrated by electron microscopy, and poxvirus was isolated on the chorioallantoic membrane of specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs. Further identification of the poxvirus species was carried out by PCR and sequencing, revealing an infection with the species fowlpox. Layers in vicinity of the turkey farm that also were affected by fowlpox were considered as potential source of infection. Although it is assumed that avian poxviruses are strongly species specific, the present case report reinforces the changing picture of poxvirus infections in turkeys. Furthermore, it supports the assumption of previous data that fowlpox virus has to be seen as recently emerging pathogen in turkeys.","['Hess C', 'Maegdefrau-Pollan B', 'Bilic I', 'Liebhart D', 'Richter S', 'Mitsch P', 'Hess M']",2011,55,4,Avian Dis,"Hess C, et al.

The antibacterial properties of the methanolic extract and fractions from stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron were tested against three Gram-positive bacteria and eight Gram-negative bacteria using Agar-well diffusion and Broth microdilution methods. Antioxidant activities of the crude extract and fractions were investigated by DPPH radical scavenging activity and β-carotene-linoleic acid assays. The methanolic extract and some fractions exhibited antibacterial activities that varied between the bacterial species (ID = 0.00-25.00 mm; MIC = 781-12500 μg/mL and 0.24-1000 μg/mL). The activity of the crude extract is, however, very weak compared to the reference antibiotics (MIC = 0.125-128 μg/mL). Two fractions (F(E) and F(F)) showed significant activity (MIC = 0.97 μg/mL) while S. aureus ATCC 25922 was almost resistant to all the tested fractions. In addition, the crude extract and some fractions showed good antioxidant potential with inhibition values ranging from 17.53 to 98.79%. These results provide promising baseline information for the potential use of this plant as well as some of the fractions in the treatment of infectious diseases and oxidative stress.","['Mokale Kognou AL', 'Ngono Ngane RA', 'Kuiate JR', 'Koanga Mogtomo ML', 'Tchinda Tiabou A', 'Mouokeu RS', 'Biyiti L', 'Amvam Zollo PH']",2011,2011,,Chemother Res Pract,"Mokale Kognou AL, et al.

MRI, performed at admission, has objectified longitudinal sinus thrombosis and a frontal parenchymal hematoma law. Meanwhile, a recent varicella seroconversion was demonstrated. The assessment of thrombophilia, meanwhile, has objectified a significant decrease in free protein S and activity, without associated DIC. Origin acquired this deficit was confirmed by the detection of antibodies (IgG and IgM) against the total protein S by ELISA. After evaluation of the benefit/risk only anticoagulation was initiated. The clinical and biological evolution was favorable, with rapid normalization of the S protein and decrease of anti-protein S. Many studies report the presence of anti-protein S in young children at the waning of chickenpox, without their exact frequency is determined. The decrease in protein S they cause leads to a transient hypercoagulable state may result in different clinical pictures.

22265826,Association of age and gender with alphaherpesvirus infections of the central nervous system in the immunocompetent host.,"BACKGROUND: The alphaherpesviruses Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and human herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) can cause severe infections of the central nervous system (CNS).
OBJECTIVES: To analyze whether age and gender of immunocompetent individuals are associated with the incidence of herpesvirus CNS diseases.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 241 patients with virologically confirmed HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV-infection of the CNS (excluding neonatal infection and varicella), diagnosed at the Department of Virology, Medical University Vienna, from 2001 to 2009 were analyzed retrospectively. The relative incidence of disease was evaluated statistically with respect to gender and age.
RESULTS: The relative incidence of VZV CNS disease increased with age (p<0.0001), and nonlinear age dependences were observed for HSV-1 (p=0.005) and HSV-2 disease (p=0.002). These effects were influenced significantly by the patient's gender in VZV (p=0.0003) and HSV-1 disease (p=0.008). Overall, 50.7% of VZV infections in males, but only 23.5% of those in females, occurred before age 45, and 28.9% of HSV-1 infections in males and 8.8% of those in females occurred before age 30. Women represented 71.9% of HSV-2 CNS infections (p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The patient's gender is clearly associated with the incidence of CNS disease caused by VZV, HSV-1 and HSV-2, and its influence varies over one's lifetime.","['Puchhammer-Stöckl E', 'Aberle SW', 'Heinzl H']",2012,53,4,J Clin Virol,"Puchhammer-Stöckl E, et al.

The VaccZyme™EIA is more robust and user friendly than the reference VZV time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (VZV TRFIA).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the usefulness of the VaccZyme™EIA in the diagnostic laboratory by comparing VZV IgG levels generated by both assays on serum panels representing, non-vaccinated, and vOka vaccinated populations.
STUDY DESIGN: Sera from non-vaccinated individuals were tested; 248 from pregnant women, 117 from various patient groups referred to the Virus Reference Department for confirmatory VZV IgG testing and 102 from healthcare workers enrolled in a study (ROVE) of antibody/IgG response to vOka. From the ROVE study, 282 post vaccination sera were tested; 108 and 101 collected at six weeks post first and second doses of vOka, respectively, and 73 collected at 18 month follow-up.
RESULTS: Sensitivities and specificities (equivocals treated as negatives) of the VaccZyme™EIA for sera from pregnant women were 97.8% (95% CI: [94.6%, 99.4%]) and 96.8% (95% CI: [89.0%, 99.6%]), respectively, and for sera referred for confirmatory testing were 81.2% (95% CI: [71.2%, 88.8%]) and 96.9% (95% CI: [83.8%, 99.9%]), respectively, and for ROVE baseline sera were 54.2% (95% CI: [32.8%, 74.4%]) and 100% (95% CI: [95.4%, 100.0%]), respectively. For the post vOka serum panels sensitivities of the VaccZyme™EIA ranged from 65.3% (95% CI: [50.4%, 78.3%]) to 80.4% (95% CI: [71.1%, 87.8%]). Specificities were all 100%. Correlation with VZV TRFIA was high and agreement varied between the serum panels tested.
CONCLUSIONS: VaccZyme™EIA is recommended for detecting VZV IgG in sera from non-vaccinated populations; however, caution is advised when measuring post vOka VZV IgG levels.","['Maple PA', 'Breuer J', 'Quinlivan M', 'Kafatos G', 'Brown KE']",2012,53,3,J Clin Virol,"Maple PA, et al.

22258257,Experimental infection of Cynomolgus Macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with human varicella-zoster virus.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a member of the alphaherpesvirus family and the causative agent of chickenpox and shingles. To determine the utility of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) as a nonhuman primate model to evaluate VZV-based simian immunodeficiency virus/human immunodeficiency virus (SIV/HIV) vaccines, we experimentally inoculated 10 animals with the parental Oka (Oka-P) strain of VZV derived from MeWo or Telo-RF cells. VZV DNA could be detected in the lungs as late as 4 days postinfection, with replicating virus detected by shell vial culture assay in one case. Infection did not result in any overt clinical symptoms but was characterized by humoral and cell-mediated immunity in a time frame and at a magnitude similar to those observed following VZV vaccination in humans. The cell line source of VZV inoculum influenced both the magnitude and polyfunctionality of cell-mediated immunity. Animals mounted a vigorous anamnestic antibody response following a second inoculation 12 weeks later. Inoculations resulted in transient increases in CD4(+) T-cell activation and proliferation, as well as a sustained increase in CD4(+) T cells coexpressing CCR5 and α4β7 integrin. In contrast to previous failed attempts to successfully utilize attenuated VZV-Oka as an SIV vaccine vector in rhesus macaques due to suboptimal infectivity and cellular immunogenicity, the ability to infect cynomolgus macaques with Oka-P VZV should provide a valuable tool for evaluating VZV-vectored SIV/HIV vaccines.","['Willer DO', 'Ambagala AP', 'Pilon R', 'Chan JK', 'Fournier J', 'Brooks J', 'Sandstrom P', 'Macdonald KS']",2012,86,7,J Virol,"Willer DO, et al.

22250453,[Chickenpox case estimation in acyclovir pharmacy survey and early bioterrorism detection].,"OBJECTIVE: Early potential health hazards and bioterrorism threats require early detection. Smallpox cases caused by terrorist could, for example, be treated by prescribing acyclovir to those having fever and vesicle exanthema diagnosed as chicken pox. We have constructed real-time pharmacy surveillance scenarios using information technology (IT) to monitor acyclovir prescription.
METHODS: We collected the number of acyclovir prescriptions from 5138 pharmacies using the Application Server Provider System (ASP) to estimate the number of cases. We then compared the number of those given acyclovir under 15 years old from pharmacy surveillance and sentinel surveillance for chickenpox under the Infection Disease Control Law.
RESULTS: The estimated number of under 15 years old prescribed acyclovir in pharmacy surveillance resembled sentinel surveillance results and showed a similar seasonal chickenpox pattern. The correlation coefficient was 0.8575. The estimated numbers of adults, older than 15 but under 65 years old, and elderly, older than 65, prescribed acyclovir showed no clear seasonal pattern.
DISCUSSION: Pharmacy surveillance for acyclovir identified the baseline and can be used to detect unusual chickenpox outbreak. Bioterrorism attack could potentially be detected using smallpox virus when acyclovir prescription for adults suddenly increases without outbreaks in children or the elderly. This acyclovir prescription monitoring such as an application is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind anywhre.","['Sugawara T', 'Ohkusa Y', 'Kawanohara H', 'Taniguchi K', 'Okabe N']",2011,85,6,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Sugawara T, et al.

22234108,"Epidemiologic lessons: chickenpox outbreak investigation in a rural community around Chandigarh, North India.","PURPOSE: Primary infection with Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) leads to Varicella or chickenpox. The epidemiology of Varicella has changed dramatically since the introduction of the Varicella vaccine in 1995. The routine childhood immunization in a few countries in the western world like Germany and the United States has reduced the incidence of the disease, associated complications, hospital admissions and deaths related to its complications. However, chickenpox outbreaks are common in naive unvaccinated communities in India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report an outbreak of chickenpox that occurred in a village situated on the outskirts of Chandigarh city in North India in the winter of 2007. The outbreak was confirmed by the detection of VZV IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on serum samples from the patients. In patients showing active lesions, Giemsa and indirect immunofluorescence was carried out on scrapings from vesicular lesions.
RESULTS: A total of 162 cases occurred in the present outbreak. The serum samples were collected from 20 patients, and all of them showed positive serology for VZV IgM antibodies while 19 showed a positive VZV IgG result by ELISA. The scrapings were collected from two patients showing active lesions, and both were positive by the Tzanck smear examination, and VZV antigen could be demonstrated by immunofluorescence.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to identify naive communities and unvaccinated individuals at risk. Also, there is a need for regular training programmes of health workers posted in peripheral centers so that highly contagious communicable diseases can be picked up in time and such outbreaks can be prevented.","['Singh MP', 'Singh G', 'Kumar A', 'Singh A', 'Ratho RK']",2011,54,4,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,"Singh MP, et al.

22232308,The risk of immune thrombocytopenic purpura after vaccination in children and adolescents.,"BACKGROUND: The risk of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after childhood vaccines other than measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) is unknown.
METHODS: Using data from 5 managed care organizations for 2000 to 2009, we identified a cohort of 1.8 million children ages 6 weeks to 17 years. Potential ITP cases were identified by using diagnostic codes and platelet counts. All cases were verified by chart review. Incidence rate ratios were calculated comparing the risk of ITP in risk (1 to 42 days after vaccination) and control periods.
RESULTS: There were 197 chart-confirmed ITP cases out of 1.8 million children in the cohort. There was no elevated risk of ITP after any vaccine in early childhood other than MMR in the 12- to 19-month age group. There was a significantly elevated risk of ITP after hepatitis A vaccine at 7 to 17 years of age, and for varicella vaccine and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine at 11 to 17 years of age. For hepatitis A, varicella, and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccines, elevated risks were based on one to two vaccine-exposed cases. Most cases were acute and mild with no long-term sequelae.
CONCLUSIONS: ITP is unlikely after early childhood vaccines other than MMR. Because of the small number of exposed cases and potential confounding, the possible association of ITP with hepatitis A, varicella, and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccines in older children requires further investigation.","[""O'Leary ST"", 'Glanz JM', 'McClure DL', 'Akhtar A', 'Daley MF', 'Nakasato C', 'Baxter R', 'Davis RL', 'Izurieta HS', 'Lieu TA', 'Ball R']",2012,129,2,Pediatrics,"O'Leary ST, et al.

VZV antibody determination is also indicated in patients considered for immunosuppressive therapy and for healthcare workers with a negative VZV history who are in contact with immunocompromised patients. Administration of VZV immunoglobulin within 96 hours following VZV contact can mitigate the infection in pregnant women and patients with T-cell deficiency. VZV immunoglobulin treatment should be considered for newborn infants of mothers who developed chickenpox in the period from five days before to two days after delivery. Antivirals can reduce the severity of infection and are safe during pregnancy. Varicella vaccine protects against chickenpox, but is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients and pregnant women.","['Rothbarth PH', 'Hartwig NG', 'Opstelten W']",2011,155,51,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Rothbarth PH, et al.

22190485,Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and survivin induction by varicella-zoster virus promote replication and skin pathogenesis.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human α-herpesvirus that causes varicella (chickenpox) during primary infection and zoster (shingles) upon reactivation. Like other viruses, VZV must subvert the intrinsic antiviral defenses of differentiated human cells to produce progeny virions. Accordingly, VZV inhibits the activation of the cellular transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), thereby downregulating antiviral factors, including IFNs. Conversely, in this study, we found that VZV triggers STAT3 phosphorylation in cells infected in vitro and in human skin xenografts in SCID mice in vivo and that STAT3 activation induces the anti-apoptotic protein survivin. Small-molecule inhibitors of STAT3 phosphorylation and survivin restrict VZV replication in vitro, and VZV infection of skin xenografts in vivo is markedly impaired by the administration of the phospho-STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201. STAT3 and survivin are required for malignant transformation caused by γ-herpesviruses, such as Kaposi's sarcoma virus. We show that STAT3 activation is also critical for VZV, a nononcogenic herpesvirus, via a survivin-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, STAT3 activation is critical for the life cycle of the virus because VZV skin infection is necessary for viral transmission and persistence in the human population. Therefore, we conclude that takeover of this major cell-signaling pathway is necessary, independent of cell transformation, for herpesvirus pathogenesis and that STAT3 activation and up-regulation of survivin is a common mechanism important for the pathogenesis of lytic as well as tumorigenic herpesviruses.","['Sen N', 'Che X', 'Rajamani J', 'Zerboni L', 'Sung P', 'Ptacek J', 'Arvin AM']",2012,109,2,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Sen N, et al.

22190254,Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infects and establishes latency in enteric neurons.,"Case reports have linked varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to gastrointestinal disorders, including severe abdominal pain preceding fatal varicella and acute colonic pseudoobstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome). Because we had previously detected DNA and transcripts encoding latency-associated VZV gene products in the human gut, we sought to determine whether latent VZV is present in the human enteric nervous system (ENS) and, if so, to identify the cells in which it is located and its route to the bowel. Neither DNA, nor transcripts encoding VZV gene products, could be detected in resected gut from any of seven control children (<1 year old) who had not received the varicella vaccine or experienced varicella; however, VZV DNA and transcripts were each found to be present in resected bowel from 6/6 of children with a past history of varicella and in that of 6/7 of children who received the varicella vaccine. Both wild-type (WT) and vaccine-type (vOka) VZV thus establish latent infection in human gut. To determine routes by which VZV might gain access to the bowel, we injected guinea pigs with human or guinea pig lymphocytes expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the VZV ORF66 gene (VZV(OKA66.GFP)). GFP-expressing enteric neurons were found throughout the bowel within 2 days and continued to be present for greater than 6 weeks. DNA encoding VZV gene products also appeared in enteric and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons following intradermal administration of WT-VZV and in enteric neurons after intradermal injection of VZV(OKA66.GFP); moreover, a small number of guinea pig DRG neurons were found to project both to the skin and the intraperitoneal viscera. Viremia, in which lymphocytes carry VZV, or axonal transport from DRG neurons infected through their epidermal projections are thus each potential routes that enable VZV to gain access to the ENS.","['Chen JJ', 'Gershon AA', 'Li Z', 'Cowles RA', 'Gershon MD']",2011,17,6,J Neurovirol,"Chen JJ, et al.

22188630,Varicella zoster virus infection among healthcare workers in Taiwan: seroprevalence and predictive value of history of varicella infection.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella zoster infection can be spread by infected healthcare workers (HCWs) to coworkers and patients. A self-reported history of chickenpox infection is sometimes taken as proof of immunity.
AIM: To establish the relationship between positive recall history and serological immunity against varicella zoster virus (VZV) amongst healthcare workers in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan.
METHODS: Between May 2008 and April 2009, all HCWs in a Taiwanese tertiary care hospital were tested for VZV immunoglobulin G (IgG), and completed a self-administered questionnaire to determine their history of varicella infection or vaccination. Those who were seronegative were vaccinated.
FINDINGS: All HCWs (N=3733) at the hospital participated in this study. Their mean age was 34.6 years, and the seroprevalence of VZV was 91.1%. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a self-reported history of varicella infection were 82.3%, 48.6%, 96.3% and 14.4%, respectively. Corresponding figures for a history of varicella vaccination were 23.4%, 69.4%, 90.9% and 6.5%, respectively. The recall history of younger HCWs and medical professionals (doctors, nurses and paramedical staff) to varicella had higher sensitivity. However, only the recall history of medical professionals had a significantly higher positive predictive value.
CONCLUSION: A positive recall history of varicella infection and vaccination did not ensure the presence of protective VZV IgG, and a negative history was not predictive of a lack of immunity. For effective prevention of nosocomial infection, VZV IgG status should be documented for all HCWs, and susceptible HCWs should be vaccinated.","['Wu MF', 'Yang YW', 'Lin WY', 'Chang CY', 'Soon MS', 'Liu CE']",2012,80,2,J Hosp Infect,"Wu MF, et al.

22176950,Sequencing and characterization of Varicella-zoster virus vaccine strain SuduVax.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox in children and shingles in older people. Currently, live attenuated vaccines based on the Oka strain are available worldwide. In Korea, an attenuated VZV vaccine has been developed from a Korean isolate and has been commercially available since 1994. Despite this long history of use, the mechanism for the attenuation of the vaccine strain is still elusive. We attempted to understand the molecular basis of attenuation mechanism by full genome sequencing and comparative genomic analyses of the Korean vaccine strain SuduVax.
RESULTS: SuduVax was found to contain a genome that was 124,759 bp and possessed 74 open reading frames (ORFs). SuduVax was genetically most close to Oka strains and these Korean-Japanese strains formed a strong clade in phylogenetic trees. SuduVax, similar to the Oka vaccine strains, underwent T- > C substitution at the stop codon of ORF0, resulting in a read-through mutation to code for an extended form of ORF0 protein. SuduVax also shared certain deletion and insertion mutations in ORFs 17, 29, 56 and 60 with Oka vaccine strains and some clinical strains.
CONCLUSIONS: The Korean VZV vaccine strain SuduVax is genetically similar to the Oka vaccine strains. Further comparative genomic and bioinformatics analyses will help to elucidate the molecular basis of the attenuation of the VZV vaccine strains.","['Kim JI', 'Jung GS', 'Kim YY', 'Ji GY', 'Kim HS', 'Wang WD', 'Park HS', 'Park SY', 'Kim GH', 'Kwon SN', 'Lee KM', 'Ahn JH', 'Yoon Y', 'Lee CH']",2011,8,,Virol J,"Kim JI, et al.

22176638,Epidemiological characteristics of varicella from 2000 to 2008 and the impact of nationwide immunization in Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella has an important impact on public health. Starting in 2004 in Taiwan, nationwide free varicella vaccinations were given to 1-year-old children.
METHODS: Our study investigated the epidemiological characteristics of varicella from 2000 to 2008, and assessed the change of varicella epidemiology after the mass varicella immunization. ICD-9-CM codes related to varicella or chickenpox (052, 052.1, 052.2, 052.7, 052.8, 052.9) were analyzed for all young people under 20 years of age through the National Health Insurance database of Taiwan from 2000 to 2008.
RESULTS: Case numbers of varicella or chickenpox significantly declined after the nationwide immunization in 2004. Winter, particularly January, was the epidemic season of varicella. We found a significant post-vaccination decrease in incidence among preschool children, especially 3 to 6 year-old children-- the peak incidence was 66 per thousand for 4 and 5 year-old children before the nationwide immunization (2000 to 2003), and the peak incidence was 23 per thousand for 6 year-old children in 2008 (p < 0.001). Varicella-related hospitalization also significantly decreased in children younger than 6 years after the nationwide immunization.
CONCLUSION: The varicella annual incidence and varicella-related hospitalization markedly declined in preschool children after nationwide varicella immunization in 2004.","['Chang LY', 'Huang LM', 'Chang IS', 'Tsai FY']",2011,11,,BMC Infect Dis,"Chang LY, et al.

22170238,The epidemiology and economic impact of varicella-related hospitalizations in Turkey from 2008 to 2010: a nationwide survey during the pre-vaccine era (VARICOMP study).,"Varicella can cause complications that are potentially serious and require hospitalization. Our current understanding of the causes and incidence of varicella-related hospitalization in Turkey is limited and sufficiently accurate epidemiological and economical information is lacking. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual incidence of varicella-related hospitalizations, describe the complications, and estimate the annual mortality and cost of varicella in children. VARICOMP is a multi-center study that was performed to provide epidemiological and economic data on hospitalization for varicella in children between 0 and 15 years of age from October 2008 to September 2010 in Turkey. According to medical records from 27 health care centers in 14 cities (representing 49.3% of the childhood population in Turkey), 824 children (73% previously healthy) were hospitalized for varicella over the 2-year period. Most cases occurred in the spring and early summer months. Most cases were in children under 5 years of age, and 29.5% were in children under 1 year of age. The estimated incidence of varicella-related hospitalization was 5.29-6.89 per 100,000 in all children between 0-15 years of age in Turkey, 21.7 to 28 per 100,000 children under 1 year of age, 9.8-13.8 per 100,000 children under 5 years of age, 3.96-6.52 per 100,000 children between 5 and 10 years of age and 0.42 to 0.71 per 100,000 children between 10 and 15 years of age. Among the 824 children, 212 (25.7%) were hospitalized because of primary varicella infection. The most common complications in children were secondary bacterial infection (23%), neurological (19.1%), and respiratory (17.5%) complications. Secondary bacterial infections (p < 0.001) and neurological complications (p < 0.001) were significantly more common in previously healthy children, whereas hematological complications (p < 0.001) were more commonly observed in children with underlying conditions. The median length of the hospital stay was 6 days, and it was longer in children with underlying conditions (<0.001). The median cost of hospitalization per patient was $338 and was significantly higher in children with underlying conditions (p < 0.001). The estimated direct annual cost (not including the loss of parental work time and school absence) of varicella-related hospitalization in children under the age of 15 years in Turkey was $856,190 to $1,407,006. According to our estimates, 882 to 1,450 children are hospitalized for varicella each year, reflecting a population-wide occurrence of 466-768 varicella cases per 100,000 children. In conclusion, this study confirms that varicella-related hospitalizations are not uncommon in children, and two thirds of these children are otherwise healthy. The annual cost of hospitalization for varicella reflects only a small part of the overall cost of this disease, as only a very few cases require hospital admission. The incidence of this disease was higher in children <1 year of age, and there are no prevention strategies for these children other than population-wide vaccination. Universal vaccination is therefore the only realistic option for the prevention of severe complications and deaths. The surveillance of varicella-associated complications is essential for monitoring of the impact of varicella immunization.","['Dinleyici EC', 'Kurugol Z', 'Turel O', 'Hatipoglu N', 'Devrim I', 'Agin H', 'Gunay I', 'Yasa O', 'Erguven M', 'Bayram N', 'Kizildemir A', 'Alhan E', 'Kocabas E', 'Tezer H', 'Aykan HH', 'Dalgic N', 'Kilic B', 'Sensoy G', 'Belet N', 'Kulcu NU', 'Say A', 'Tas MA', 'Ciftci E', 'Ince E', 'Ozdemir H', 'Emiroglu M', 'Odabas D', 'Yargic ZA', 'Nuhoglu C', 'Carman KB', 'Celebi S', 'Hacimustafaoglu M', 'Elevli M', 'Ekici Z', 'Celik U', 'Kondolot M', 'Ozturk M', 'Tapisiz A', 'Ozen M', 'Tepeli H', 'Parlakay A', 'Kara A', 'Somer A', 'Caliskan B', 'Velipasalioglu S', 'Oncel S', 'Arisoy ES', 'Guler E', 'Dalkiran T', 'Aygun D', 'Akarsu S', 'VARICOMP Study Group']",2012,171,5,Eur J Pediatr,"Dinleyici EC, et al.

22137370,[Susceptibility to measles and varicella in healthcare workers in a tertiary hospital in Catalonia].,"INTRODUCTION: To estimate the susceptibility to measles and varicella (chickenpox) in healthcare workers in a public tertiary level teaching hospital, in Catalonia.
METHODS: A prevalence study was conducted from January 2006 to December 2008 on 2,752 workers who had serology performed for the determination of measles or varicella by ELISA test during a health examination. Data were analysed by, sex, age, professional category and work unit.
RESULTS: A total of 153 healthcare workers were susceptible to measles and 187 to varicella. The susceptibility of healthcare workers to measles was 6.04% (95% CI: 5.78 to 6.30), and to varicella it was 7.45% (95% CI: 7.14 to 7.75). The highest susceptibility to measles was in resident physicians with 14% (95% CI: 10.8 to 18.5). In high-risk services, where highly immunocompromised patients are attended, the susceptibility of workers was slightly higher than the rest to measles (6.32% vs 5.93%) and varicella (8.34% vs 7.09%). Healthcare workers born after 1980 were 20 times (95% CI: 11.0 to 37.2) more likely to be susceptible to measles, and 2 times (95% CI: 1.2 to 3.2) more likely to be susceptible to varicella than those those born before 1965.

22123875,Varicella in infants after implementation of the US varicella vaccination program.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe varicella disease in infants since implementation of the varicella vaccination program in the United States.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 2008, demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic data on cases of varicella in infants were collected prospectively through a community-based active surveillance project. We examined disease patterns for infants in 2 age groups: 0 to 5 and 6 to 11 months.
RESULTS: Infant varicella disease incidence declined 89.7% from 1995 to 2008. Infants aged 0 to 5 months had milder clinical disease than those aged 6 to 11 months: ≥50 lesions, 49% vs 58% (P = .038); fever (body temperature > 38°C), 12% vs 21% (P = .014); and varicella-related complications, 6% vs 14% (P = .009), respectively. Age was an independent predictor of the occurrence of complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The varicella vaccination program has resulted in substantial indirect benefits for infants, who are not eligible for vaccination. Presence of maternal varicella-zoster virus antibodies might explain attenuated disease in very young infants likely born to mothers with history of varicella. Although varicella disease incidence has declined, exposure to varicella-zoster virus continues to occur. Improving varicella vaccination coverage in all age groups will further reduce the risk of varicella exposure and protect those not eligible for varicella vaccination.","['Chaves SS', 'Lopez AS', 'Watson TL', 'Civen R', 'Watson B', 'Mascola L', 'Seward JF']",2011,128,6,Pediatrics,"Chaves SS, et al.

22123665,Varicella vaccines.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Live attenuated vaccines exist for varicella and herpes zoster. Varicella vaccine is largely administered in the immunocompetent population despite substantial evidence indicating its safety and effectiveness in immunocompromised groups.
RECENT FINDINGS: Varicella vaccine has been around for decades and its safety and efficacy in healthy children is well documented in the literature. The vaccine is contraindicated in the immunodeficient population. Recent studies have examined the immune response of varicella vaccine in children suffering from hematological malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus with a CD4 T-cell count of at least 200  cell/μl, atopic dermatitis, and juvenile rheumatic diseases and found that the vaccine was immunogenic in most cases. In addition, the herpes zoster vaccine, which is the newest addition to the varicella vaccine family, has proven to be well tolerated and effective in healthy adults; however, the vaccination rate has been dismal.
SUMMARY: Studies suggest that varicella vaccine is well tolerated and immunogenic in moderately immunocompromised children and could be beneficial in reducing the burden of viral infection. Similar studies in immunodeficient adults should be undertaken for herpes zoster vaccine, which has been shown to lower the incidence of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.","['Javed S', 'Javed SA', 'Tyring SK']",2012,25,2,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Javed S, et al.

22121271,Herpes zoster: a clinical study in 205 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Even though herpes zoster is a common condition its incidence and pattern of occurrence in the era of HIV disease is significant.
AIM: To analyze the incidence, pattern of occurrence and evolution of herpes zoster with special attention to provocative factors if any.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: This was an analytical study conducted for 2 years based on a preformed proforma containing preliminary information, a detailed clinical evaluation regarding the segment of involvement, morphology, pattern of lesions, complications, disseminations etc. and investigations to establish provocative factors if any.
RESULTS: Incidence of herpes zoster was mainly in the fourth and third decades of life. A definite history of chicken pox was present in only 63.4% cases. In the majority (70%) herpes zoster occurred spontaneously. In 30% cases, immunosuppression due to chemotherapy, malignancy, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus were observed. The commonest segment affected was thoracic (42.4%) followed by cranial (28.2%) and cervical (12.1%). Majority resolved in 7-14 days except immunosuppressed. 34.6% of the patients had complications such as secondary bacterial infection, post herpetic neuralgia, and motor weakness. Ten patients had HIV infection as a provocative factor.
CONCLUSION: The results of incidence and clinical pattern of herpes zoster is almost parallel to the previous studies. Any factors of immunosuppression should be checked, especially HIV, particularly in disseminated and long-lasting cases.","['Abdul Latheef EN', 'Pavithran K']",2011,56,5,Indian J Dermatol,Abdul Latheef EN and Pavithran K.

22119592,The cost-effectiveness of varicella and combined varicella and herpes zoster vaccination programmes in the United Kingdom.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of varicella vaccine, many developed countries have not introduced it into their national schedules, partly because of concerns about whether herpes zoster (HZ, shingles) will increase due to a lack of exogenous boosting. The magnitude of any increase in zoster that might occur is dependent on rates at which adults and children mix - something that has only recently been quantified - and could be reduced by simultaneously vaccinating older individuals against shingles. This study is the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of combined varicella and zoster vaccination options and compare this to alternative programmes.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The cost-effectiveness of various options for the use of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) containing vaccines was explored using a transmission dynamic model. Underlying contact rates are estimated from a contemporary survey of social mixing patterns, and uncertainty in these derived from bootstrapping the original sample. The model was calibrated to UK data on varicella and zoster incidence. Other parameters were taken from the literature. UK guidance on perspective and discount rates were followed. The results of the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis suggest that a combined policy is cost-effective. However, the cost-effectiveness of this policy (and indeed the childhood two-dose policy) is influenced by projected benefits that accrue many decades (80-100 years or more) after the start of vaccination. If the programme is evaluated over shorter time frames, then it would be unlikely to be deemed cost-effective, and may result in declines in population health, due to a projected rise in the incidence of HZ. The findings are also sensitive to a number of parameters that are inaccurately quantified, such as the risk of HZ in varicella vaccine responders.
CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers should be aware of the potential negative benefits in the first 30-50 years after introduction of a childhood varicella vaccine. This can only be partly mitigated by the introduction of a herpes zoster vaccine. They have to decide how they value the potential benefits beyond this time to consider childhood vaccination cost effective.","['van Hoek AJ', 'Melegaro A', 'Gay N', 'Bilcke J', 'Edmunds WJ']",2012,30,6,Vaccine,"van Hoek AJ, et al.

22108039,Acceptance on the move: public reaction to shifting vaccination realities.,"This review examines four events related to vaccination that have occurred in recent years: (a) the ongoing recovery from the MMR/Autism scare in the UK, (b) the upgrading of the Varicella vaccine to a universal childhood vaccine, (c) the major effort of authorities to provide a vaccine for A/H1N1 influenza and its rejection by the public, and, d) the current attempts to change the HPV vaccine target from girls only to boys and girls. All of these changes have been met with shifts in the public acceptance of the relevant vaccine. These shifts are characterized not only by the number of people willing to be vaccinated, but also by the attitudes and the motives related to acceptance. Examination of the interrelationship between changes in vaccination realities, and changes in acceptance patterns suggests that today, the public has a better understanding of vaccination, is acting in a more reflexive way, and is capable of changing attitudes and behavior. All together, changes in vaccination enhance debates and dialogues about vaccines, and lead to higher awareness and more conscious acceptance.",['Velan B'],2011,7,12,Hum Vaccin,Velan B.

22102814,CD4 T cell immunity is critical for the control of simian varicella virus infection in a nonhuman primate model of VZV infection.,"Primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) results in varicella (more commonly known as chickenpox) after which VZV establishes latency in sensory ganglia. VZV can reactivate to cause herpes zoster (shingles), a debilitating disease that affects one million individuals in the US alone annually. Current vaccines against varicella (Varivax) and herpes zoster (Zostavax) are not 100% efficacious. Specifically, studies have shown that 1 dose of varivax can lead to breakthrough varicella, albeit rarely, in children and a 2-dose regimen is now recommended. Similarly, although Zostavax results in a 50% reduction in HZ cases, a significant number of recipients remain at risk. To design more efficacious vaccines, we need a better understanding of the immune response to VZV. Clinical observations suggest that T cell immunity plays a more critical role in the protection against VZV primary infection and reactivation. However, no studies to date have directly tested this hypothesis due to the scarcity of animal models that recapitulate the immune response to VZV. We have recently shown that SVV infection of rhesus macaques models the hallmarks of primary VZV infection in children. In this study, we used this model to experimentally determine the role of CD4, CD8 and B cell responses in the resolution of primary SVV infection in unvaccinated animals. Data presented in this manuscript show that while CD20 depletion leads to a significant delay and decrease in the antibody response to SVV, loss of B cells does not alter the severity of varicella or the kinetics/magnitude of the T cell response. Loss of CD8 T cells resulted in slightly higher viral loads and prolonged viremia. In contrast, CD4 depletion led to higher viral loads, prolonged viremia and disseminated varicella. CD4 depleted animals also had delayed and reduced antibody and CD8 T cell responses. These results are similar to clinical observations that children with agammaglobulinemia have uncomplicated varicella whereas children with T cell deficiencies are at increased risk of progressive varicella with significant complications. Moreover, our studies indicate that CD4 T cell responses to SVV play a more critical role than antibody or CD8 T cell responses in the control of primary SVV infection and suggest that one potential mechanism for enhancing the efficacy of VZV vaccines is by eliciting robust CD4 T cell responses.","['Haberthur K', 'Engelmann F', 'Park B', 'Barron A', 'Legasse A', 'Dewane J', 'Fischer M', 'Kerns A', 'Brown M', 'Messaoudi I']",2011,7,11,PLoS Pathog,"Haberthur K, et al.

We analyse a detailed dataset on contact patterns across five European countries and use available serological profiles for varicella and parvovirus B19 infections to identify the types of contact that may be most relevant for transmission. We show that models informed by contact data fit well the observed serological profiles of both infections. We find that intimate types of contacts explain the pattern of acquisition of serological markers by age better than other types of social contacts. We observe similar patterns in each of the countries analysed, suggesting that there are consistent biological mechanisms at work.","['Melegaro A', 'Jit M', 'Gay N', 'Zagheni E', 'Edmunds WJ']",2011,3,03월 04일,Epidemics,"Melegaro A, et al.

22093160,The burden of varicella from a parent's perspective and its societal impact in The Netherlands: an Internet survey.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is a common childhood disease. Only 5% of first varicella-zoster-virus infections occur asymptomatically. Most data on the burden of varicella stem from health service databases. This study aims to provide insight in the burden of varicella from a parent's perspective including cases outside the healthcare system.
METHODS: An internet questionnaire was developed for parents in the Netherlands to report health care resource use and productivity losses during the varicella episode in their child younger than 6 years. 11,367 invitations were sent out to members with children of an internet panel of a market research agency. 4,168 (37%) parents started the questionnaire (response rate), of which 360 (9%) stopped before completion and 1,838 (44%) were out of the target group. In total 1,970 parents completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire provided a symptom list ranging from common symptoms, such as skin vesicles, itching to fits or convulsions. A posteriori, in the analyses, the symptoms 'skin infections', 'fits/convulsions', 'unconsciousness', and 'balance and movement disorders' were labelled as complications. There was no restriction to time since the varicella episode for inclusion in the analyses.
RESULTS: The 1,970 respondents had in total 2,899 children aged younger than six years, of which 2,564 (88%) children had had varicella. In 62% of the episodes the parent did not seek medical help. In 18% of all episodes symptoms labelled as complications were reported; in 11% of all episodes parents visited a medical doctor (MD) for a complication. Reporting of complications did not differ (X2 ; p = 0.964) between children with a recent (≤ 12 months ago) or a more distant (> 12 months) history of varicella. Prescription drugs were used in 12% of the children with varicella; OTC drugs in 72%. Parents reported work loss in 17% of the varicella-episodes (23% when MD visit; 14% when no MD-visit) for on average 14 hours, which equals to 2.5 hours of work loss for any given varicella-episode.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the full spectrum of varicella-episodes and associated healthcare use, including the large proportion of cases not seeking medical care and the societal impact associated with those cases.","['Wolleswinkel-van den Bosch JH', 'Speets AM', 'Rümke HC', 'Gumbs PD', 'Fortanier SC']",2011,11,,BMC Infect Dis,"Wolleswinkel-van den Bosch JH, et al.

22064267,"An open-label, randomized, multi-center study of the immunogenicity and safety of DTaP-IPV (Kinrix™) co-administered with MMR vaccine with or without varicella vaccine in healthy pre-school age children.","BACKGROUND: In the US, it is recommended that 4-6 year old children receive diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), inactivated poliovirus (IPV), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella (V), and influenza vaccines. Data relating to the concomitant administration of combination DTaP-IPV vaccine (Kinrix™; GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) and influenza or V vaccines are currently limited. This study was undertaken to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Kinrix™ when co-administered with MMR (M-M-RII(®), Merck & Co.) and Varivax™ (Merck & Co.) in 4-6 year old children.
METHODS: Phase IIIb, open-label, non-inferiority study (NCT00871117). We randomized (1:1) healthy 4-6 year olds to receive Kinrix™+MMR+V on day 0 (Group 1), or Kinrix™+MMR on day 0, followed by V at month 1 (Group 2). We measured DTaP-IPV immunogenicity before and 1 month post-vaccination (prior to V vaccination in Group 2). We collected local and general solicited symptoms within 4 days after vaccination and serious adverse events (SAEs) through 6 months post-vaccination.
RESULTS: We enrolled 478 subjects. One month post-vaccination, >95% of subjects in both groups had booster responses to diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis antigens and all subjects had seroprotective anti-poliovirus antibody titers. Immune responses in Group 1 were non-inferior to Group 2 for responses to DTaP-IPV antigens according to pre-specified criteria. Reporting of solicited local events at the DTaP-IPV site appeared to be similar between the two vaccine groups, as was reporting of solicited general adverse events within 4 days of vaccination; no vaccine related SAEs were reported.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant administration of varicella vaccine with Kinrix™ and MMR did not impact the immunogenicity of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or poliovirus antigens. Both vaccine regimens were well tolerated. These results support the co-administration of DTaP-IPV, MMR, and V vaccines in 4-6-year-old children, providing protection against multiple diseases in a timely and efficient manner.","['Klein NP', 'Weston WM', 'Kuriyakose S', 'Kolhe D', 'Howe B', 'Friedland LR', 'Van Der Meeren O']",2012,30,3,Vaccine,"Klein NP, et al.

22052378,Simian varicella virus gene expression during acute and latent infection of rhesus macaques.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic α-herpesvirus that causes chickenpox during primary infection and establishes latency in sensory ganglia. Reactivation of VZV results in herpes zoster and other neurological complications. Our understanding of the VZV transcriptome during acute and latent infection in immune competent individuals remains incomplete. Infection of rhesus macaques with the homologous simian varicella virus (SVV) recapitulates the hallmarks of VZV infection. We therefore characterized the SVV transcriptome by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR during acute infection in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and during latency in sensory ganglia obtained from the same rhesus macaques. During acute infection, all known SVV open reading frames (ORFs) were detected, and the most abundantly expressed ORFs are involved in virus replication and assembly such as the transcriptional activator ORF 63 and the structural proteins ORF 41 and ORF 49. In contrast, latent SVV gene expression is highly restricted. ORF 61, a viral transactivator and latency-associated transcript, is the most prevalent transcript detected in sensory ganglia. We also detected ORFs A, B, 4, 10, 63, 64, 65, 66, and 68 though significantly less frequently than ORF 61. This comprehensive analysis has revealed genes that potentially play a role in the establishment and/or maintenance of SVV latency.","['Meyer C', 'Kerns A', 'Barron A', 'Kreklywich C', 'Streblow DN', 'Messaoudi I']",2011,17,6,J Neurovirol,"Meyer C, et al.

We describe a severe life-threatening infection with varicella vaccine virus causing rash and pneumonitis in a 6-year-old boy with no apparent immunodeficiency.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of vesicle swab samples demonstrated varicella zoster virus (VZV). Sequencing of the PCR product demonstrated 100% homology with human herpesvirus 3 strain VZV-Oka ORF62 gene. Routine immunologic investigations failed to demonstrate any abnormality. Total leukocyte, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts and lymphocyte subsets were normal. Immunoglobulins, C3, C4, and CH50 were intact. Specific IgG to protein and polysaccharide antigens and to Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were present. Normal lymphocyte proliferation to phytohemagglutinin and VZV antigens was detected. Neutrophil function and natural killer (NK) cell activity were normal. The analysis of invariant NK T (iNKT) cell numbers and function revealed diminished iNKT cells, reported once previously and unique to our patient, deficient expression of the cognate receptor, CD1d.
CONCLUSIONS: This report provides a further link between deficiency of the iNKT/CD1d pathway and increased susceptibility to varicella vaccine virus, suggesting an important role of this innate pathway in host defense against yet another member of the herpesvirus family.","['Banovic T', 'Yanilla M', 'Simmons R', 'Robertson I', 'Schroder WA', 'Raffelt NC', 'Wilson YA', 'Hill GR', 'Hogan P', 'Nourse CB']",2011,204,12,J Infect Dis,"Banovic T, et al.

METHODS: Forty four neonates with vesicobullous lesions in Departments of Dermatology and Pediatrics were evaluated with respect to diagnosis, required treatments and follow ups.
RESULTS: Of the total 44 neonates, 29 were boys and 15 girls. Low birth weight (weight at birth less than 2,500 g as per WHO criteria) was seen in 19 neonates. Of the infectious dermatoses, most common were pyodermas. Four cases (9%) were diagnosed to be of staphylococcal pyoderma and impetigo and two cases each of Group A Streptococcal impetigo and neonatal tinea faciei (4.5% each), one case each of neonatal candidiasis, neonatal varicella/chickenpox and scabies (2.3% each) were seen.

22025718,Structure-function analysis of varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein H identifies domain-specific roles for fusion and skin tropism.,"Enveloped viruses require membrane fusion for cell entry and replication. For herpesviruses, this event is governed by the multiprotein core complex of conserved glycoproteins (g)B and gH/gL. The recent crystal structures of gH/gL from herpes simplex virus 2, pseudorabies virus, and Epstein-Barr virus revealed distinct domains that, surprisingly, do not resemble known viral fusogens. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chicken pox and shingles. VZV is an α-herpesvirus closely related to herpes simplex virus 2, enabling prediction of the VZV gH structure by homology modeling. We have defined specific roles for each gH domain in VZV replication and pathogenesis using structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of gH. The distal tip of domain (D)I was important for skin tropism, entry, and fusion. DII helices and a conserved disulfide bond were essential for gH structure and VZV replication. An essential (724)CXXC(727) motif was critical for DIII structural stability and membrane fusion. This assignment of domain-dependent mechanisms to VZV gH links elements of the glycoprotein structure to function in herpesvirus replication and virulence.","['Vleck SE', 'Oliver SL', 'Brady JJ', 'Blau HM', 'Rajamani J', 'Sommer MH', 'Arvin AM']",2011,108,45,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Vleck SE, et al.

With 12,500 deaths in the United States in 2009-2010, the influenza (H1N1) 2009 pandemic was actually less deadly than the seasonal flu. But it essentially hit the young, and the toll calculated in years of life lost is high. The monovalent vaccines, whether live attenuated or inactivated with or without adjuvants, were well tolerated in toddlers, children, adults and pregnant women. In order to protect infants against pertussis, family members are urged to get their booster shots. The introduction of the 13-valent Pneumococcal conjugated vaccine in the beginning of 2010 may solve - but for how long ? - the problem of serotype replacement, responsible for the re-increasing incidence of invasive Pneumococcal infections observed in countries that had introduced the 7-valent vaccine. The efficacy of a rotavirus vaccine has been confirmed, with a reduction in hospitalization in the United States and a reduction in gastroenteritis-related deaths in Mexico. In the United States, vaccination of pre-adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV) has not resulted in any specific undesirable effects. Routine vaccination against chicken pox, recommended since 1995, has not had an impact on the evolution of the incidence of shingles. Vaccination against shingles, recommended in the United States for subjects 60 years and over, shows an effectiveness of 55 %, according to a cohort study (Kaiser Permanente, Southern California). Although some propose the development of personalized vaccines according to individual genetic characteristics, the priority remains with increasing vaccine coverage, not only in infants but also in adults and the elderly. Vaccine calendars that cover a whole lifetime should be promoted, since the vaccination of adults and seniors is a determining factor of good health at all ages.","['Aubert M', 'Aumaître H', 'Beytout J', 'Bloch K', 'Bouhour D', 'Callamand P', 'Chave C', 'Cheymol J', 'Combadière B', 'Dahlab A', 'Denis F', 'De Pontual L', 'Dodet B', 'Dommergues MA', 'Dufour V', 'Gagneur A', 'Gaillat J', 'Gaudelus J', 'Gavazzi G', 'Gillet Y', 'Gras-le-Guen C', 'Haas H', 'Hanslik T', 'Hau-Rainsard I', 'Larnaudie S', 'Launay O', 'Lorrot M', 'Loulergue P', 'Malvy D', 'Marchand S', 'Picherot G', 'Pinquier D', 'Pulcini C', 'Rabaud C', 'Regnier F', 'Reinert P', 'Sana C', 'Savagner C', 'Soubeyrand B', 'Stephan JL', 'Strady C']",2011,18,11,Arch Pediatr,"Aubert M, et al.

We sought to determine whether WTVZV in childhood protects against atopic disorders, allergic sensitization or decreases serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, practice-based study of outpatient pediatric practices in NY. One hundred children with WTVZV up to 8 yr of age and 323 children who received varicella vaccine (VV) were randomly selected.
RESULTS: WTVZV up to 8 yr of age is associated with decreased odds of subsequent asthma (exact logistic regression; OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.57, p = 0.003), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05-0.49, p = 0.0003), and AD (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33-0.96, p = 0.02), but not food allergies (p = 0.78); decreased total serum IgE levels [mixed linear model, LSM (95% CI): 129.09 (33.22-501.63) vs. 334.21 (102.38-1091.04) IU/ml; p = 0.02] remained significant at all time intervals after WTVZV (<5, 5-10, and >10) compared with VV (p = 0.003-0.03). WTVZV was associated with decreased allergic sensitization (logistic regression, OR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.03-0.38, p = 0.0004). WTVZV is also associated with persistently decreased numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes (p < 0.0001) for up to 12 yr (p = 0.0003-0.047), monocytes (p = 0.002) for up to 16 yr (p < 0.001) and basophils at ages 4-6, 10-12, and 14-16 (p < 0.03).
CONCLUSION: WTVZV up to 8 yr of age protects against atopic disorders, which is likely mediated by suppression of IgE production and allergic sensitization, as well as altered leukocyte distributions.","['Silverberg JI', 'Kleiman E', 'Silverberg NB', 'Durkin HG', 'Joks R', 'Smith-Norowitz TA']",2012,23,1,Pediatr Allergy Immunol,"Silverberg JI, et al.

22015389,"Impact of universal vaccination on the epidemiology of varicella in Veneto, Italy.","In 2005, universal varicella vaccination was introduced in the Veneto region, Italy. We examined trends in varicella incidence and hospitalization rates before and after vaccine introduction, and applied statistical models to assess vaccine effectiveness. Varicella incidence rates for 2000-2008 were calculated from the mandatory regional surveillance data and from a special surveillance system based on reports from a sample of family pediatricians that during the study period followed more than 40,000 children. To evaluate hospital admission rates, we analyzed the regional hospital discharge registry. The vaccine coverage rate was 6.8% in the 2004 birth-cohort and 78.6% in the 2008 cohort. Varicella incidence in 0-14 year-olds was 6136.8/100,000 person-years in 2000 and 4004.8 in 2008; hospitalization rates were 18.7 and 8.4. Incidence rates significantly decreased 2.5 years after beginning the universal vaccination, while hospitalization rates showed a significant decrease one year earlier. There was a remarkable decline of both varicella incidence and hospitalizations especially in 1-4 year-old children.

21989288,Safety of a second dose of varicella vaccine administered at 4 to 6 years of age in healthy children in Argentina.,"Varicela Biken [Live varicella Biken vaccine (strain Oka)] is an effective and safe vaccine for the prevention of varicella infection. Although the recommended schedule in all age groups (children, adolescents and adults) is a single dose, physicians in some countries follow the 2007 recommendation of the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) which recommends ""implementation of a routine 2-dose varicella vaccination program for children, with the first dose administered at age 12--15 months and the second dose at age 4--6 years."" ( 1) Therefore, cases can arise when two doses of Varicela Biken are given even though the ACIP guidelines are a response to the US epidemiological situation and for US licensed products based on the Oka/Merck and the Oka-RIT strains (Varicela Biken is not registered in US). The aim of this study is to ascertain the safety of a second dose of Varicela Biken in children who have been previously vaccinated with the same vaccine. In this study, children, 4-6 years of age who had been previously vaccinated with Varicela Biken, received a single 0.5 mL dose of live attenuated varicella virus vaccine containing at least 1000 Plaque Forming Units (PFU) attenuated live Varicella-zoster virus (Oka strain). Participants were monitored for 30 minutes after vaccination. Predefined injection site and systemic reactions were solicited during the subsequent seven days. Unsolicited injection site reactions and unsolicited systemic events were collected throughout the study. Any serious adverse events occurring throughout the study were reported to the sponsor's pharmacovigilance department. One hundred and twenty two children were recruited and all provided safety data. There were no immediate adverse events or injection site reactions. Forty three percent of participants reported injection site reactions and 22.1% reported systemic reactions on solicitation during the seven days after vaccination. During the 30 day monitoring period, 43 participants reported a total of 66 adverse events. Seven participants reported a total of eight unsolicited events that were assessed as related to the vaccine or where the relationship to vaccination was unknown. Five of these eight events were injection site reactions and all were mild, systemic reactions included mild rash (1 case) and fever (2 cases). There was a single serious adverse event that was not related to the study medication (subject was a passenger in a motor vehicle accident). A second dose of Varicela Biken was well tolerated and showed no significant safety issues in this population of previously vaccinated children.","['Fridman D', 'Monti A', 'Bonnet MC', 'Armoni J', 'Stamboulian D']",2011,7,10,Hum Vaccin,"Fridman D, et al.

This risk is increased by immunomodulatory therapies. Vaccination for influenza and pneumococcal disease reduces the risk. Severe cases of varicella infection have occurred in patients on biologic therapies. We sought to identify vaccination rates for commonly acquired infections and to ascertain varicella immune status in patients with inflammatory arthritis. 100 patients with inflammatory arthritis were administered a standardised questionnaire. Data collected included age, diagnosis, vaccination history, history of varicella, treatment and the presence of other indications for vaccination. 58 patients (58%) had not received the influenza vaccine in the past year. Only 19 patients (19%) had ever received pneumococcal vaccine. Anti TNF use did not predict vaccination (p = .46). An increasing number of co morbid conditions predicted both pneumococcal (p < 0.003) and influenza vaccine (p < 0.03) administration. Nineteen patients (19%) gave no history of varicella infection, none having had varicella titres checked pre treatment.

21939721,Population-based incidence of herpes zoster after introduction of a publicly funded varicella vaccination program.,"BACKGROUND: Past varicella infection (chicken pox) may reactivate into herpes zoster (shingles). Varicella vaccination leads to a reduction in cases of varicella that may in turn increase herpes zoster rates due to reduction in the immune boosting effect of exposure to varicella zoster virus against varicella reactivation. We assessed the impact of childhood varicella vaccination in Ontario, Canada on zoster incidence and healthcare visits, and established baseline zoster rates prior to zoster vaccine introduction.
METHODS: We used population-based, administrative databases to identify zoster incidence and healthcare use from April 1992 to March 2010.
RESULTS: After routine varicella vaccination, zoster incidence rates decreased 29% for children aged 0-9 and changed minimally for other ages. Age-standardized rates of hospitalizations during the study period declined by 53%, while outpatient rates declined by 9%. The annual zoster incidence for those 60 or older was 740 per 100,000.
CONCLUSIONS: In the early post-varicella vaccination period, incidence rates of medically attended herpes zoster did not increase for the overall population and decreased moderately for children 9 years and younger, the age group targeted for varicella vaccination.","['Tanuseputro P', 'Zagorski B', 'Chan KJ', 'Kwong JC']",2011,29,47,Vaccine,"Tanuseputro P, et al.

Here, we report a new potency assay for varicella vaccine based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with a much more efficient virus infection step. Potency results can be obtained within 24h of infection and demonstrates acceptable accuracy and reproducibility when compared with the plaque assay, which relies on manual counting of plaques formed one week after viral infection. Using multiple vaccine lots from 7 manufacturers, we found no significant difference in infectivity determined between the new assay and plaque assay. The optimized conditions for viral infection and polymerase chain reaction are of significant value for the potency determination of the vaccine due to its rapidity, accuracy and the high throughput capacity of the assay.","['Russell MS', 'Li C', 'Larocque L', 'Wang J', 'Farnsworth A', 'He R', 'Li X']",2011,29,47,Vaccine,"Russell MS, et al.

Persistence of immunity against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella as well as varicella breakthrough cases were assessed 3 years after two-dose measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccination or concomitant MMR (Priorix™) and varicella (Varilrix™) vaccination. Four hundred ninety-four healthy children, 12-18 months old at the time of the first dose, received either two doses of MMRV vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) 42-56 days apart (MMRV, N = 371) or one dose of MMR and varicella vaccines administered simultaneously at separate sites, followed by another MMR vaccination 42-56 days later (MMR + V, N = 123). Three hundred-four subjects participated in 3-year follow-up for persistence of immunity and occurrence of breakthrough varicella (MMRV, N = 225; MMR + V, N = 79). Antibodies were measured by ELISA (measles, mumps, rubella) and immunofluorescence (varicella). Contacts with individuals with varicella or zoster and cases of breakthrough varicella disease were recorded. Three years post-vaccination seropositivity rates in subjects seronegative before vaccination were: MMRV-measles, 98.5% (geometric mean titer [GMT] = 3,599.6); mumps, 97.4% (GMT = 1,754.5); rubella, 100% (GMT = 51.9); varicella, 99.4% (GMT = 225.5); MMR + V-measles, 97.0% (GMT = 1,818.8); mumps, 93.8% (GMT = 1,454.6); rubella, 100% (GMT = 53.8); and varicella, 96.8% (GMT = 105.8). Of the subjects, 15-20% reported contact with individuals with varicella/zoster each year. After 3 years, the cumulative varicella breakthrough disease rate was 0.7% (two cases) in the MMRV group and 5.4% (five cases) in the MMR + V group.

21919621,Molecular studies of the Oka varicella vaccine.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is one of eight members of the Herpesviridae family for which humans are the primary host; it causes two distinct diseases, varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles). Varicella results from primary infection, during which the virus establishes latency in sensory neurons, a characteristic of all members of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Zoster is caused by reactivation of latent virus, which typically occurs when cellular immunity is impaired. VZV is the first human herpesvirus for which a vaccine has been licensed. The vaccine preparation, v-Oka, is a live-attenuated virus stock produced by the classic method of tissue culture passage in animal and human cell lines. Over 90 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in countries worldwide, including the USA, where varicella morbidity and mortality has declined dramatically. Over the last decade, several laboratories have been committed to investigating the mechanism by which the Oka vaccine is attenuated. Mutations have accumulated across the genome of the vaccine during the attenuation process; however, studies of the contribution of these changes to vaccine attenuation have been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model of VZV disease and by the heterogeneity that exists among the viral population within the vaccine preparation. Notwithstanding, a wealth of data has been generated using various laboratory methodologies. Studies of the vaccine virus in human xenografts implanted in severe combined immunodeficiency-hu mice, have enabled analyses of the replication dynamics of the vaccine in dorsal root ganglia, T lymphocytes and skin. In vitro assays have been used to investigate the effect of vaccine mutations on viral gene expression and sequence analysis of vaccine rash viruses has permitted investigations into spread of the vaccine virus in a human host. We present here a review of what has been learned thus far about the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of the Oka vaccine.","['Quinlivan M', 'Breuer J', 'Schmid DS']",2011,10,9,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Quinlivan M, et al.

METHODS: Pregnant women undergoing first trimester Down screening over a 3-months period were recruited for the study.
RESULTS: Positive immunity was found in 477 (95.4%) of the 500 recruited women, and those with positive, negative, or uncertain history of infection had similarly high seroprevalence (96.4, 90.5, 95.9% respectively). The mean age of infection from self-recalled history was 8.61 (SD 4.69) years, and only 3% recalled infection after age 18. Insufficient knowledge on the disease and vaccination was demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of a routine vaccination programme, VZV immunity was high among pregnant women, the majority being infected during childhood and infection above age 18 was very rare. Hence, universal antenatal screening or vaccination for all women in the reproductive age would not be cost-effective in Hong Kong.","['Fung LW', 'Lao TT', 'Suen SS', 'Chan OK', 'Lau TK', 'Ngai KL', 'Chan PK', 'Leung TY']",2011,29,46,Vaccine,"Fung LW, et al.

21910730,Respiratory alkalosis in children with febrile seizures.,"PURPOSE: Febrile seizures (FS) are the most common type of convulsive events in children. FS are suggested to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. However, the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying FS remain unclear. Using an animal model of experimental FS, it was demonstrated that hyperthermia causes respiratory alkalosis with consequent brain alkalosis and seizures. Here we examine the acid-base status of children who were admitted to the hospital for FS. Children who were admitted because of gastroenteritis (GE), a condition known to promote acidosis, were examined to investigate a possible protective effect of acidosis against FS.
METHODS: We enrolled 433 age-matched children with similar levels of fever from two groups presented to the emergency department. One group was admitted for FS (n = 213) and the other for GE (n = 220). In the FS group, the etiology of fever was respiratory tract infection (74.2%), otitis media (7%), GE (7%), tonsillitis (4.2%), scarlet fever (2.3%) chickenpox (1.4%), urinary tract infection (1.4%), postvaccination reaction (0.9%), or unidentified (1.4%). In all patients, capillary pH and blood Pco(2) were measured immediately on admission to the hospital.
KEY FINDINGS: Respiratory alkalosis was found in children with FS (pH 7.46 ± 0.04, [mean ± standard deviation] Pco(2) 29.5 ± 5.5 mmHg), whereas a metabolic acidosis was seen in all children admitted for GE (pH 7.31 ± 0.03, Pco(2) 37.7 ± 4.3 mmHg; p < 0.001 for both parameters). No FS were observed in the latter group. A subgroup (n = 15; 7%) of the patients with FS had GE and, notably, their blood pH was more alkaline (pH 7.44 ± 0.04) than in the GE-admitted group. During the enrollment period, eight of the patients were admitted on separate occasions because of FS or GE. Consistent with the view that generation of FS requires a genetic susceptibility in addition to acute seizure triggering factors, each of these patients had an alkalotic blood pH when admitted because of FS, whereas they had an acidotic pH (and no FS) when admitted because of GE (pH 7.47 ± 0.05 vs. pH 7.33 ± 0.03, p < 0.005).
SIGNIFICANCE: The results show that FS are associated with a systemic respiratory alkalosis, irrespective of the severity of the underlying infection as indicated by the level of fever. The lack of FS in GE patients is attributable to low pH, which also explains the fact that children with a susceptibility to FS do not have seizures when they have GE-induced fever that is associated with acidosis. The present demonstration of a close link between FS and respiratory alkalosis may pave the way for further clinical studies and attempts to design novel therapies for the treatment of FS by controlling the systemic acid-base status.","['Schuchmann S', 'Hauck S', 'Henning S', 'Grüters-Kieslich A', 'Vanhatalo S', 'Schmitz D', 'Kaila K']",2011,52,11,Epilepsia,"Schuchmann S, et al.

21906410,"The incidence of varicella and herpes zoster in Taiwan during a period of increasing varicella vaccine coverage, 2000-2008.","The introduction and the widespread use of the varicella vaccine in Taiwan has led to a 75-80% decrease in the incidence of varicella in children. However the vaccine's long-term impact on the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) has attracted attention. By controlling gender, underlying diseases, and age effects, a Poisson regression was applied on the 2000-2008 chart records of 240 000 randomly selected residents who enrolled in the Universal National Health Insurance. The results show that, as the vaccine coverage in children increases, the incidence of varicella decreases. However, the incidence of HZ increased even before the implementation of the free varicella vaccination programme in 2004, particularly in females. The increase in the incidence of HZ cannot be entirely and directly attributed to the widespread vaccination of children. Continuous monitoring is needed to understand the secular trends in HZ before and after varicella vaccination in Taiwan and in other countries.","['Chao DY', 'Chien YZ', 'Yeh YP', 'Hsu PS', 'Lian IB']",2012,140,6,Epidemiol Infect,"Chao DY, et al.

21904402,"[Impact of universal vaccination against chicken pox in Navarre, 2006-2010].","BACKGROUND: In 2007 universal vaccination against chicken pox was introduced in the vaccine calendar of Navarre. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of this measure on the incidence of chicken pox in both the vaccinated cohorts (direct effect) and in the unvaccinated cohorts (indirect effect).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Chicken pox is a disease of individualized compulsory notification. We analyzed the annual incidence by age groups between 2006 and 2010. Hospital admittances with chicken pox or complicated chicken pox as the principal diagnosis were taken from the minimum basic data set on hospital discharges for the years 2006 to 2009.
RESULTS: The incidence of chicken pox has fallen by 93.0%, from 8.04 cases per 1,000 inhabitants in 2006 to 0.56 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2010 (p<0,0001). In children from 1 to 6 years (vaccinated cohorts), the incidence of chicken pox has fallen by 96.3%. In the cohorts vaccinated at 10 and 14 years, a fall of 93.6% can also be observed in children from 10 to 14 years, and of 85.0% in those of 15 to 19 years. In the unvaccinated age groups we can observe falls of 88.2% in children under one year, of 73.3% in those of 7 to 9 years, and of 84.6% in people over 20 years. In 2006 there were 25 hospital admissions due to chicken pox in Navarre and in 2009 this figure fell to 7. The rate of admissions fell by 71%.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of universal chicken pox vaccination in Navarre has resulted in a rapid and very steep reduction of the incidence of chicken pox in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.","['Cenoz MG', 'Catalán JC', 'Zamarbide FI', 'Berastegui MA', 'Gurrea AB']",2011,34,2,An Sist Sanit Navar,"Cenoz MG, et al.

21901036,[Post-exposure varicella prophylaxis].,"BACKGROUND: Varicella may have a serious and sometimes fatal course, especially in immunocompromised patients. Some patient groups may need prophylaxis after exposure to the varicella-zoster-virus. In this article we review the evidence for usefulness of prophylactic measures after such exposure.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is based on a non-systematic literature search in Medline, the Cochrane Library, UpToDate and Clinical Evidence.
RESULTS: The effect of post-exposure varicella prophylaxis on disease rate and severity of varicella is only weakly documented. There is some evidence that passive immunisation with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) reduces the risk of serious disease when it is administered within 72-96 hours after exposure. Several studies of mostly healthy children have shown that prophylactic acyclovir is better than control treatment, but the studies are small and they are not properly designed. Post-exposure vaccination is shown to reduce disease rate and severity in otherwise healthy children.
INTERPRETATION: We believe that acyclovir or valacyclovir can be used as post-exposure varicella prophylaxis in risk patients for whom the time window for VZIG-use has expired.","['Johansen JS', 'Westergren T', 'Lingaas E']",2011,131,17,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Johansen JS, et al.

21896342,Vaccination in paediatric patients with auto-immune rheumatic diseases: a systemic literature review for the European League against Rheumatism evidence-based recommendations.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze available evidence on vaccinations in paediatric patients with rheumatic and autoinflammatory diseases. This evidence formed the basis of the recently constructed European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for vaccination of these patients.
METHODS: A systematic literature review in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted using various terms for vaccinations, paediatric rheumatic and autoinflammatory diseases and immunosuppressive drugs. Only papers on paediatric patients (<18 years of age) were selected. A panel of 13 experts in the field graded methodological quality and extracted data using predefined criteria.
RESULTS: 27 papers were available. No studies were found on autoinflammatory diseases. 14 studies considered live-attenuated vaccines. Evidence so far supports the safety and immunogenicity of non-live composite vaccines, although studies were underpowered to accurately assess safety. Live-attenuated vaccines did not cause disease flares or severe adverse events, not even in patients on methotrexate and low dose glucocorticosteroids. Seven patients on anti-TNFalpha therapy were described receiving the live-attenuated measles, mumps, rubella (n=5) or varicella (n=2) booster without severe adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Data on safety and efficacy of vaccinations in paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases is reassuring, but too limited to draw definite conclusions. More research is needed on the safety and efficacy of especially live-attenuated vaccines in patients with rheumatic and autoinflammatory diseases using high dose immunosuppressive drugs.","['Heijstek MW', 'Ott de Bruin LM', 'Borrow R', 'van der Klis F', 'Koné-Paut I', 'Fasth A', 'Minden K', 'Ravelli A', 'Abinun M', 'Pileggi G', 'Borte M', 'Bijl M', 'Wulffraat NM']",2011,11,2,Autoimmun Rev,"Heijstek MW, et al.

It is estimated from postlicensure data that after vaccination at 12 through 23 months of age, 7 to 9 febrile seizures occur per 10,000 children who receive the MMRV, and 3 to 4 febrile seizures occur per 10,000 children who receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines administered concurrently but at separate sites. Thus, 1 additional febrile seizure is expected to occur per approximately 2300 to 2600 children 12 to 23 months old vaccinated with the MMRV, when compared with separate MMR and varicella vaccine administration. The period of risk for febrile seizures is from 5 through 12 days after receipt of the vaccine(s). No increased risk of febrile seizures is seen among patients 4 to 6 years of age receiving MMRV. Febrile seizures do not predispose to epilepsy or neurodevelopmental delays later in life and are not associated with long-term health impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that either MMR and varicella vaccines separately or the MMRV be used for the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines administered at 12 through 47 months of age. For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines administered at ages 48 months and older, and for dose 2 at any age (15 months to 12 years), use of MMRV generally is preferred over separate injections of MMR and varicella vaccines.",['Committee on Infectious Diseases'],2011,128,3,Pediatrics,Committee on Infectious Diseases.

METHODS: Serologic testing for all four viruses and a self-administered questionnaire to identify risk factors were conducted on child-care staff aged 20-50 years old and on a reference group of women.
RESULTS: In 395 exposed and 382 reference women, CMV, B19V, rubella and varicella seroprevalence were 69.4, 79.4, 98.7, 100% for exposed women, and 41.1, 68.0, 98.2, 99.7% for reference women, respectively. For CMV, the adjusted seroprevalence ratio (PR) of exposed versus reference workers, (PR, 1.43 [95% IC, 1.22-1.69]) was observed as of the first year of exposure. The risk attributed to occupation was 30.1%. Identified risk factors included exposure duration, past employment in maternity hospital, and participation in cleaning tasks. The risk attributable to personal factors ranged from 14.5% to 32.4%. The adjusted B19V PR was not significant (PR, 1.05 [95% IC, 0.94-1.16]).

It is characterized by recurrent infections and agammaglobulinemia. We report the case of a 6-year-old male patient with third-degree consanguinity, product of a third pregnancy and complete immunization scheme. He had a history of oral candidiasis at the age of 3 months, chicken pox at the age of 7 months, and two episodes of complicated bronchopneumonia at the age of 1 year and 6 years. He was admitted to the hospital because of fever and cough. Examination of the chest showed rales and right basilar hypoventilation, and a blood cell count revealed leukocytosis and neutrophilia. The diagnosis of pneumonia was made. He was treated with IV antibiotics. Serum immunoglobulins were reported to be low (IgM 55 mg/dL, IgA 0.9 mg/dL, and IgG 199 mg/dL). With these findings the clinical diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (ALX) was concluded. A molecular test was performed fining a BTK gene confirming the diagnosis of Bruton's disease. Therapy with intravenous IgG was started every 21 days. During his evolution, he presented three episodes of rhinosinusitis, one of suppurative otitis media, and four events of pneumonia that required 37 days of hospitalization. After hospital discharge, the patient was free of infections and he returned to his daily activities. In cases of recurrent and severe respiratory infections in children, we must consider primary immunodeficiency disease in the differential diagnosis, mainly antibiotic deficiency.

Adverse effects in pre-marketing clinical controlled multicenter studies have led to specific precautions that have to be followed before initiating treatment. According to the European Union prescribing information fingolimod is not to be used as a first-line treatment, but is licensed as a second-line option or escalating therapy of MS. During treatment physical and neurological examinations as well as regular blood counts should be performed. The immunosuppressive mode of action of fingolimod requires increased awareness of infectious complications. Due to two fatal herpetic infections during the TRANSFORMS trial all patients without a history of chicken pox or without vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV) should be tested for antibodies to VZV. Comparably to other immunosuppressive treatment strategies the immune response to vaccines may be hampered during treatment with fingolimod. Thus, on the one hand, vaccination gaps should be closed before initiation of fingolimod treatment and, on the other hand, success of vaccinations during fingolimod therapy may have to be checked by antibody titre assessment.","['Winkelmann A', 'Löbermann M', 'Reisinger EC', 'Zettl UK']",2012,83,2,Nervenarzt,"Winkelmann A, et al.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the need to implement this policy in Lebanon.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed on students of the Lebanese University (LU), faculties of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy and Public Health.
METHODS: The serological immunity status was assessed by determining specific antibody titer and the disease and vaccination history of 502 students was collected. Based on percentages of susceptibility, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to compare systematic vaccination without prior serological testing with selective vaccination of seronegative students.
RESULTS: Percentages of individuals with serologically confirmed immunity against varicella, measles, rubella and mumps were 93%, 86%, 88% and 75% respectively, and 42% of the students were susceptible to at least one of the pathogens covered by the MMR vaccine. Compilation of 186 vaccination records indicated that only 19 students (10%) had been adequately vaccinated. Moreover, among those, 7 students (37%) were still unprotected against at least one virus. Systematic vaccination against MMR was found to be 4-5 times less expensive than selective vaccination, while selective vaccination of seronegative individuals was more cost-efficient for varicella.
CONCLUSION: Since, in this population, very few individuals were able to present a proof of adequate vaccination, it is recommended to systematically vaccinate healthcare students in Lebanon against MMR. For varicella, selective vaccination after serological testing should be performed.","['Chamat S', 'Salameh P', 'Haddad N', 'Berry A', 'Chedid P', 'Bouharoun-Tayoun H']",2011,4,3,J Infect Public Health,"Chamat S, et al.

Treatment for Ramsay Hunt syndrome is usually with antivirals, although there is no evidence for beneficial effect on the outcome of Ramsay Hunt syndrome in adults (insufficient data on children exists). Here, we report a case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome occurring in a child who inadvertently received a lower dose of aciclovir and steroid administered for shorter than is usual. Our patient made a full recovery.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old African boy presented to our out-patients department with an inability to move the right side of his face for one week. He had previously been seen by the doctor on call, who prescribed aciclovir 200 mg three times per day and prednisone 20 mg once daily, both orally for five days, with a working diagnosis of Bell's palsy. After commencement of aciclovir-prednisone, while at home, our patient had headache, malaise, altered taste, vomiting after feeds, a ringing sound in his right ear as well as earache and ear itchiness. Additionally, he developed numerous fluid-filled pimples on his right ear. On presentation, a physical examination revealed a right-sided lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy and a healing rash on the right pinna. On direct questioning, our patient admitted having had chicken pox about three months previously. Based on the history and physical examination, Ramsay Hunt syndrome was diagnosed. Our patient was lost to follow-up until 11 months after the onset of illness; at this time, his facial nerve function was normal.
CONCLUSIONS: This case report documents the clinical manifestations and outcome of pediatric Ramsay Hunt syndrome; a condition with few case reports in the literature.

21814504,Modelling the effects of population structure on childhood disease: the case of varicella.,"Realistic, individual-based models based on detailed census data are increasingly used to study disease transmission. Whether the rich structure of such models improves predictions is debated. This is studied here for the spread of varicella, a childhood disease, in a realistic population of children where infection occurs in the household, at school, or in the community at large. A methodology is first presented for simulating households with births and aging. Transmission probabilities were fitted for schools and community, which reproduced the overall cumulative incidence of varicella over the age range of 0-11 years old.Moreover, the individual-based model structure allowed us to reproduce several observed features of VZV epidemiology which were not included as hypotheses in the model: the age at varicella in first-born children was older than in other children, in accordance with observation; the same was true for children residing in rural areas. Model predicted incidence was comparable to observed incidence over time. These results show that models based on detailed census data on a small scale provide valid small scale prediction. By simulating several scenarios, we evaluate how varicella epidemiology is shaped by policies, such as age at first school enrolment, and school eviction. This supports the use of such models for investigating outcomes of public health measures.","['Silhol R', 'Boëlle PY']",2011,7,7,PLoS Comput Biol,Silhol R and Boëlle PY.

This study describes the context of a large outbreak of chickenpox in the Cauca Valley region, Colombia (2003 to 2007), with an emphasis on macro-determinants. We explored the temporal trends in chickenpox incidence in 42 municipalities to identify the places with higher occurrences. We analyzed municipal characteristics (education quality, vaccination coverage, performance of health care services, violence-related immigration, and area size of planted sugar cane) through analyses based on set theory. Edwards-Venn diagrams were used to present the main findings. The results indicated that three municipalities had higher incidences and that poor quality education was the attribute most prone to a higher incidence. Potential use of set theory for exploratory outbreak analyses is discussed.

21794170,Is ultra-violet radiation the main force shaping molecular evolution of varicella-zoster virus?,"BACKGROUND: Varicella (chickenpox) exhibits a characteristic epidemiological pattern which is associated with climate. In general, primary infections in tropical regions are comparatively less frequent among children than in temperate regions. This peculiarity regarding varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection among certain age groups in tropical regions results in increased susceptibility during adulthood in these regions. Moreover, this disease shows a cyclic behavior in which the number of cases increases significantly during winter and spring. This observation further supports the participation of environmental factors in global epidemiology of chickenpox. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this distinctive disease behavior are not understood completely. In a recent publication, Philip S. Rice has put forward an interesting hypothesis suggesting that ultra-violet (UV) radiation is the major environmental factor driving the molecular evolution of VZV.
DISCUSSION: While we welcomed the attempt to explain the mechanisms controlling VZV transmission and distribution, we argue that Rice's hypothesis takes lightly the circulation of the so called ""temperate VZV genotypes"" in tropical regions and, to certain degree, overlooks the predominance of such lineages in certain non-temperate areas. Here, we further discuss and present new information about the overwhelming dominance of temperate VZV genotypes in Mexico regardless of geographical location and climate.
SUMMARY: UV radiation does not satisfactorily explain the distribution of VZV genotypes in different tropical and temperate regions of Mexico. Additionally, the cyclic behavior of varicella does not shown significant differences between regions with different climates in the country. More studies should be conducted to identify the factors directly involved in viral spreading. A better understanding of the modes of transmissions exploited by VZV and their effect on viral fitness is likely to facilitate the implementation of preventive measures for disease control.","['Vaughan G', 'Rodríguez-Castillo A', 'Cruz-Rivera MY', 'Ruiz-Tovar K', 'Ramírez-González JE', 'Rivera-Osorio P', 'Fonseca-Coronado S', 'Carpio-Pedroza JC', 'Cazares F', 'Vazquez-Pichardo M', 'Anaya L', 'Escobar-Gutiérrez A']",2011,8,,Virol J,"Vaughan G, et al.

21788222,Near elimination of varicella deaths in the US after implementation of the vaccination program.,"OBJECTIVE: Varicella has been preventable by vaccination in the United States since 1995. Previous studies reported a 66% decline in mortality rate during the first 6 years of the program. Since then, vaccination coverage has increased substantially. We updated the analysis of US varicella mortality for 2002-2007 and assessed the impact of the first 12 years of the US varicella vaccination program on varicella deaths.
METHODS: National data on deaths for which varicella was listed as an underlying or contributing cause were obtained from the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death records from the US National Center for Health Statistics. We calculated the age-adjusted and age-specific mortality rates for 2002-2007 and trends since the prevaccine years.
RESULTS: During the 12 years of the mostly 1-dose US varicella vaccination program, the annual average mortality rate for varicella listed as the underlying cause declined 88%, from 0.41 per million population in 1990-1994 to 0.05 per million population in 2005-2007. The decline occurred in all age groups, and there was an extremely high reduction among children and adolescents younger than 20 years (97%) and among subjects younger than 50 years overall (96%). In the last 6 years analyzed (2002-2007), a total of 3 deaths per age range were reported among children aged 1 to 4 and 5 to 9 years, compared with an annual average of 13 and 16 deaths, respectively, during the prevaccine years.
CONCLUSIONS: The impressive decline in varicella deaths can be directly attributed to successful implementation of the 1-dose vaccination program. With the current 2-dose program, there is potential that these most severe outcomes of a vaccine-preventable disease could be eliminated.","['Marin M', 'Zhang JX', 'Seward JF']",2011,128,2,Pediatrics,"Marin M, et al.

Despite that immunosuppressed children are suggested to require 2 doses of vaccine to achieve seroconversion, conflicting results are reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the seroconversion status and mean antibody titers at first year after single dose and double doses of varicella vaccination in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Patients with leukemia in remission for at least 1 year who were seronegative for varicella-zoster virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) were vaccinated. Titers above the cutoff level (0.65) were accepted as seroconversion. Seventeen patients were vaccinated with single dose whereas 24 patients were vaccinated with double doses. Mean prevaccination antibody titers were 0.56 ± 0.05 in patients with single dose and 0.51 ± 0.08 in patients with double doses (P > .05, Student t test). The mean antibody titers at first year were 0.61 ± 0.05 in patients with single-dose vaccination (P > .05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and 1.48 ± 0.04 in patients with double doses (P < .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Seroconversion after single-dose vaccination was achieved in 29% of patients (n = 5/17) and in 75% of patients with double doses (n = 18/24) at first year (P = .004, chi-square test). These results suggest that seroconversion after single-dose vaccination might not persist at first year in malignancy patients. Double doses should be applied in order to provide long-term seroconversion.","['Cakir FB', 'Timur C', 'Yoruk A', 'Cakir E', 'Ayhan AC']",2012,29,2,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,"Cakir FB, et al.

METHODS: We interviewed women who had had VZV infection in pregnancy and who underwent diagnostic amniocentesis to detect transplacental infection using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cell culture methods to characterize their children's clinical and psychomotor development.
RESULTS: Twenty women who had a diagnosis of primary VZV during pregnancy were available for interview. The mean gestational age at which primary VZV was acquired was 11±3.5 weeks. One infant had hypospadias and developmental delay. He was born to an epileptic mother who had been treated during pregnancy with sodium valproate and clonazepam.

RECENT FINDINGS: Vaccine coverage is relatively static or improving for the vaccines included in the 2010 annual harmonized immunization schedules. Providers should be reviewing patients' immunization records at each visit to take advantage of any opportunity to administer indicated, age-appropriate vaccines. There have been infectious disease outbreaks among highly immunized populations, although unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals continue to play large roles in the spread of disease. Infants, many of whom are too young to be vaccinated, continue to bear a large disease burden, which underscores the importance of cocooning and, in some cases, vaccination of pregnant women. Influenza, measles, mumps, and rubella, varicella, hepatitis A, meningococcal conjugate, human papillomavirus, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis, and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccines are reviewed in this second of two articles.
SUMMARY: New research on childhood and adolescent vaccines is anticipated to shape the practice of pediatric providers.

21724043,"Unusually severe varicella zoster (VZV) virus viral (aseptic) meningitis in an unimmunized, immunocompetent host with chickenpox.","Chickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) and may be more severe in adults than in children. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of chickenpox and VZV are uncommon, for example, encephalitis and cerebellar ataxis. Viral (aseptic) meningitis is a rare CNS complication of VZV. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile in VZV viral (aseptic) meningitis is indistinguishable from other causes of viral meningitis. The clue to most of the diagnoses of VZV aseptic meningitis is based on the temporal relationship between antecedent or concomitant chickenpox. Chickenpox is a clinical diagnosis based on the appearance and distribution of the rash. The rash of chickenpox is vesicular/pruritic and typically appears in crops over 3 successive days. VZV vesicles are fragile, superficial, and surrounded by a erythematous halo. Common nonspecific laboratory findings in chickenpox include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum transaminases (serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase/serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is not highly elevated in chickenpox. In VZV aseptic meningitis, the CSF shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal protein, glucose, and lactic acid levels. CSF red blood cells are not a feature of VZV meningitis. We present the case of a healthy unimmunized adult who was hospitalized with chickenpox complicated by VZV aseptic meningitis with an unusually severe headache and nuchal rigidity that occurred during hospitalization.","['Cunha BA', 'Warren-Favorito H', 'Mickail N']",2011,40,4,Heart Lung,"Cunha BA, et al.

Although atypical manifestations of the virus are occasionally seen, it rarely presents with cardiovascular sequelae. Cardiovascular complications of varicella can include pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis. Herein, we report the case of a 17-year-old boy who had varicella infection and severe chest pain. Examination revealed atypical electrocardiographic findings of pericarditis and remarkably elevated cardiac biomarker levels: peak cardiac troponin I, 37.2 ng/mL; total creatine kinase, 1,209 U/L; and creatine kinase-MB fraction, 133.6 ng/mL. After results of coronary angiography reliably excluded ischemia and myocardial infarction, the diagnosis was varicella myopericarditis.

DESIGN: An observational study in three parts: (1) a retrospective survey of serostatus at diagnosis of malignancy, (2) collation of varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) dispensing data over a 3-year period and (3) an online survey of paediatric oncologists' clinical practice and beliefs in relation to VZV disease and its prevention.
SETTING: UK and Ireland.
PARTICIPANTS: Children diagnosed with malignancy in 2009 (serostatus survey) or receiving VZIG between April 2006 and March 2009 (VZIG dispensing study). Paediatric oncologists and haematologists working in tertiary paediatric oncology centres and related shared care units in the UK and Ireland (physician survey).
RESULTS: Of 1500 children diagnosed with malignancy each year, at least 24% are VZV seronegative. Few centres make efforts to prevent household exposure by vaccinating VZV-susceptible family members. Exposures to VZV result in the administration of PEP to approximately 250 children with cancer annually: half receive an intramuscular injection of VZIG while the remainder receive a course of oral aciclovir. The choice of PEP is made by doctors. There is no consensus among paediatric oncologists as to which is the better option, reflecting the lack of a secure evidence base.

21699441,Emerging drugs for varicella-zoster virus infections.,"INTRODUCTION: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of two distinct diseases, varicella (chickenpox) and shingles (herpes zoster). Chickenpox occurs following primary infection, while herpes zoster (usually associated with ageing and immunosuppression) is the consequence of reactivation of the latent virus. Post-herpetic neuralgia is the major complication of shingles.
AREAS COVERED: This review will discuss vaccination strategies and the current status of antivirals against VZV. A live attenuated vaccine, Varivax, is available for pediatric varicella while Zostavax was developed to boost VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity in adults older than 60 years and, via this mechanism, to decrease the burden of herpes zoster and pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. Despite the availability of a vaccine, there is a need for new antiviral agents. Current drugs approved for the treatment of VZV infections include nucleoside analogs that target the viral DNA polymerase and depend on the viral thymidine kinase. Novel anti-VZV drugs have recently been evaluated in clinical trials, including the bicyclic nucleoside analog FV-100, the helicase-primase inhibitor ASP2151 and valomaciclovir (prodrug of the acyclic guanosine derivative H2G).
EXPERT OPINION: New anti-VZV drugs should be as safe as and more effective than acyclovir and its prodrug valacyclovir (current gold standard for the treatment of VZV).","['Andrei G', 'Snoeck R']",2011,16,3,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Andrei G and Snoeck R.

In contrast, the disease course is likely to be more severe or complicated in the adult, particularly so in the pregnant woman. There is a definite risk of congenital varicella syndrome when the chickenpox occurs during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. This syndrome predominantly affects the skin, the subcutaneous tissue, muscles and bones, as well as the central nervous system, and can bring about major functional sequellae. In case of chickenpox occurring at the very end of pregnancy, transplacental transfer of the virus may result in a perinatal varicella disease.

Two vaccinated patients lacking follow-up titers were excluded from analysis. Stem cells were derived from an HLA-matched sibling (n = 18) or an alternative (HLA mismatched related or unrelated) donor (n = 26). Median time to vaccination was 4 years.

There was no significant difference in response between recipients of a matched related or alternative donor graft (P = .2) or between those given a T cell-depleted or T-replete alternative donor graft (P = .27). Three of 44 patients developed a self-limited varicella-like rash within 2.5 weeks of immunization. With a median follow-up of 29.1 (range: 6.9-167.1) months, there were no subsequent cases of varicella-like rashes. No patient developed shingles.

A questionnaire, including previous history of varicella, was completed for each participant and, in 590 of them, VZV-specific IgG was measured using an ELISA test. Overall, 28.5% of individuals were seronegative for VZV. By 5 years of age, only 25.5% of children were seropositive for VZV. Among adolescents and young adults, 18.8% and 11.7% were seronegative, respectively. The negative predictive value was 57.8%, decreasing with age (81.9% in children, 34.5% in adolescents and 8.3% in adults). In conclusion, a negative history of varicella is not a reliable predictor of varicella antibody status in adolescents and young adults. Serological testing before immunisation will be logical, rather than presumptive vaccination, for adolescents and adults with negative history of varicella.","['Koturoglu G', 'Kurugol Z', 'Turkoglu E']",2011,25,4,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,"Koturoglu G, et al.

21645604,Acute and sub-acute toxicity of the methanolic extract of Pteleopsis hylodendron stem bark.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pteleopsis hylodendron is one of the most popular medicinal plants in Cameroon where it is used to treat measles, chickenpox, sexually transmitted diseases, female sterility, liver and kidney disorders as well as dropsy. To date there is no documented evidence corroborating its safety. This study thus aimed to determine the toxicity profile of the methanolic extract of Pteleopsis hylodendron.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The acute and sub-chronic toxicity of the methanolic extract of Pteleopsis hylodendron were investigated by employing established methods. The acute toxicity study was done by administering single doses (2-8 g/kg body weight) of plant extract to adult mice. For the sub chronic toxicity study, doses (85-680 mg/kg bw) of plant extract were administered daily to adult rats during 28 days after which the effect on organs, the hematological and biochemical parameters was assessed.
RESULTS: In mice, single oral administrations of the methanolic extract of Pteleopsis hylodendron caused dose-dependent general behaviour adverse effects and mortality. The LD50 values were 3.00 and 3.60 g/kg bw for males and females respectively. In rats, daily single oral doses of the methanolic extract of Pteleopsis hylodendron provoked significant (p < 0.05) growth retardation in rats at all tested doses after 28 days of dosing. Haematological parameters showed a significant decrease in white blood cells count and significant increases red blood cells count; irrespective of the sex, all biochemical parameters studied, except triglycerides significantly (p < 0.001) increased with dose. However, a dose-dependent significant (p < 0.007) increase in HDL was observed only in male rats. Increases in liver enzymes (ALT and AST), proteins and creatinine levels correlate the observed histopathological damages (i.e. inflammation and vascular congestions) in the liver and kidneys.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall results of this study indicate that the methanolic extract of Pteleopsis hylodendron stem bark possesses hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects at doses ≥ 85 mg/kg bw, suggesting that this plant should be used with caution.","['Nana HM', 'Ngane RA', 'Kuiate JR', 'Mogtomo LM', 'Tamokou JD', 'Ndifor F', 'Mouokeu RS', 'Etame RM', 'Biyiti L', 'Zollo PH']",2011,137,1,J Ethnopharmacol,"Nana HM, et al.

21632611,Epidemiological game-theory dynamics of chickenpox vaccination in the USA and Israel.,"The general consensus from epidemiological game-theory studies is that vaccination coverage driven by self-interest (Nash vaccination) is generally lower than group-optimal coverage (utilitarian vaccination). However, diseases that become more severe with age, such as chickenpox, pose an exception to this general consensus. An individual choice to be vaccinated against chickenpox has the potential to harm those not vaccinated by increasing the average age at infection and thus the severity of infection as well as those already vaccinated by increasing the probability of breakthrough infection. To investigate the effects of these externalities on the relationship between Nash and utilitarian vaccination coverages for chickenpox, we developed a game-theory epidemic model that we apply to the USA and Israel, which has different vaccination programmes, vaccination and treatment costs, as well as vaccination coverage levels. We find that the increase in chickenpox severity with age can reverse the typical relationship between utilitarian and Nash vaccination coverages in both the USA and Israel. Our model suggests that to obtain herd immunity of chickenpox vaccination, subsidies or external regulation should be used if vaccination costs are high. By contrast, for low vaccination costs, improving awareness of the vaccine and the potential cost of chickenpox infection is crucial.","['Liu J', 'Kochin BF', 'Tekle YI', 'Galvani AP']",2012,9,66,J R Soc Interface,"Liu J, et al.

21617573,Immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated hepatitis A vaccine when coadministered with measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines in children less than 2 years of age.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis A vaccination in early childhood has reduced hepatitis A transmission. Coadministration of hepatitis A vaccine with other childhood vaccines may assist completion of the age-appropriate immunization schedule. We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated hepatitis A virus vaccine when coadministered with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines in children less than 2 years of age.
METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, multicenter study, 3 groups of healthy children 15 months of age received either 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine 6 to 9 months apart (n = 324), hepatitis A vaccine coadministered with MMR and varicella vaccines and a second dose of hepatitis A vaccine 6 to 9 months later (n = 462), or MMR and varicella vaccines followed 6 weeks later by 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine 6 to 9 months apart (n = 455). Immune responses were evaluated at baseline, 31 days after the second dose of hepatitis A vaccine, and 42 days after MMR and varicella vaccine administration. Solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events were collected.
RESULTS: After 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine, nearly all subjects in all groups were seropositive (≥99%). Coadministration of hepatitis A vaccine with MMR and varicella vaccines did not impact the immunogenicity of any of the vaccines and was well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: The immune response to hepatitis A vaccine and US-licensed MMR and varicella vaccines is not adversely affected when coadministered in children 15 months of age.","['Rinderknecht S', 'Michaels MG', 'Blatter M', 'Gaglani M', 'Andrews W', 'Abughali N', 'Chandreshekaran V', 'Trofa AF']",2011,30,10,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Rinderknecht S, et al.

21605371,"Hospitalizations for varicella in children and adolescents in a referral hospital in Hong Kong, 2004 to 2008: a time series study.","BACKGROUND: Varicella accounts for significant morbidities and remains a public health issue worldwide. Climatic factors have been shown to associate with the incidence and transmission of various infectious diseases. We describe the epidemiology of varicella in paediatric patients hospitalized at a tertiary referral hospital in Hong Kong from 2004 to 2008, and to explore the possible association between the occurrence of varicella infection and various climatic factors.
METHODS: The hospital discharge database of Princess Margaret Hospital was retrospectively analyzed for admissions associated with varicella from 2004 to 2008. Meteorological data were obtained from the monthly meteorological reports from the Hong Kong Observatory website. Time series analysis was performed with Poisson regression using a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach.
RESULTS: During the study period, 598 children were hospitalized for varicella. The mean age on admission was 57.6 months, and the mean duration of hospitalization was 3.7 days. The overall complication rate was 47%. The mean monthly relative humidity, especially in cool seasons, was inversely correlated with the monthly varicella cases of the same month.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella can lead to serious complications and prolonged hospitalization, even in previously healthy children. Lower relative humidity in cool seasons is associated with higher number of paediatric varicella hospital admissions. These findings are useful for a better understanding of the pattern of paediatric varicella hospitalization in Hong Kong.","['Chan JY', 'Tian L', 'Kwan Y', 'Chan W', 'Leung C']",2011,11,,BMC Public Health,"Chan JY, et al.

21600672,Management and outcome of a varicella exposure in a neonatal intensive care unit: lessons for the vaccine era.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella exposure in health care settings poses a threat to susceptible, immunocompromised hosts. We describe the management and outcome of a varicella exposure in a neonatal intensive care unit.
METHODS: We reviewed the history of the index case, determination of the exposed cohort, medical management of exposed neonates, and assignment of health care workers based on exposure and immune status. We present the results of serologic testing of health care workers related to their history of varicella disease.
RESULTS: Of 427 health care workers assessed at the time of the exposure, 13.1% were seronegative for varicella. Among 180 employees recorded as having a previous history of varicella, 9 were seronegative. A total of 34 infants received prophylaxis with intravenous immune globulin; acyclovir prophylaxis was added for those born at <28 weeks gestational age. The exposed cohort was isolated. No secondary cases of varicella occurred among patients or health care workers.
CONCLUSION: Nosocomial varicella exposures require rapid assessment and response, which can be guided by a checklist of actions. Varicella immunity in health care workers cannot be assumed even among those born before 1980; institutional policies should adhere to the 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of immunity to varicella for health care workers.","['Kellie SM', 'Makvandi M', 'Muller ML']",2011,39,10,Am J Infect Control,"Kellie SM, et al.

21592838,"Varicella rates among unvaccinated and one-dose vaccinated healthy children in Izmir, Turkey.","OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the rate of breakthrough varicella in Turkey, a country with low varicella vaccination coverage.
METHODS: This study was conducted between April 2008 and March 2009 at the Well-Child Clinic at Ege University and pediatricians' offices. We collected information on vaccination status and varicella infection using a questionnaire. In order to elicit more details about the severity of illness, we interviewed all parents and reviewed the clinician records. Vaccination status was verified from the medical records or vaccination cards with dates.
RESULTS: A total of 2802 children were evaluated. Of these, 1683 had been vaccinated with a single dose of varicella vaccine and 1119 were unvaccinated. Among vaccinated children, 466 (27.7%) had breakthrough varicella. Vaccinated children tended to have mild varicella. However, about 25% of breakthrough cases had moderate or severe disease. Children who were vaccinated ≥ 5 years previously had a 3.7-fold higher risk of breakthrough disease than those who were vaccinated <5 years before. Vaccination at younger than 15 months of age was not significantly associated with an increased risk of breakthrough infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Breakthrough varicella is not rare in Turkey where varicella infections are common. A longer interval since vaccination may be a risk factor for developing breakthrough varicella. Children who had been vaccinated >5 years previously were at risk for breakthrough disease. A two-dose varicella vaccine policy may be needed to provide improved protection.","['Kurugol Z', 'Halicioglu O', 'Koc F', 'Koturoglu G', 'Aksit S']",2011,15,7,Int J Infect Dis,"Kurugol Z, et al.

21572607,"Study of susceptibility towards varicella by screening for the presence of IgG antibodies among nursing and medical students of a tertiary care teaching hospital in pune, India.","BACKGROUND: It is believed that all suffer from chickenpox infection in their childhood. Many studies abroad and some in India clearly indicate that many individuals escape the infection in childhood, and thus, remain susceptible in adulthood. Adulthood chickenpox is a more serious infection than childhood. Prior screening of health care workers for the presence of IgG antibodies against Varicella will not only prevent hospital outbreaks but also economic and academic loss faced by the students. This will also have an important implication in terms of patient care as there is a threat of spreading Varicella to immuno-compromised patients. Definite history of prior infection of chickenpox is considered as an indicator for immunity towards the same. However, the reliability of this needs to be tested.
AIM: A study to assess the susceptibility of nursing and medical students towards Varicella infection by screening for IgG antibodies against Varicella virus and to identify any risk factors for the same.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A hospital-based cross-sectional study in nursing and medical students.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 78 nursing and medical students participated in the study. They were given prestructured and pretested questionnaires. After obtaining informed consent, blood sample was collected and screened for the presence of IgG antibodies against Varicella by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) by using a commercial kit.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Epi_info 2002 was used for analysis. Age of the study subjects were summarized as mean age and standard deviation. Susceptibility was analyzed as percentage with 95% confidence interval and Chi Square test was used to find association of susceptibility status with sex and region of residence in childhood. Relevance of definite history as an indicator for immunity was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: Twenty males (25.6%) and 58 females (74.4%) participated in the study from medical and nursing students. The mean age ± standard deviation of mean was 19.4 ± 1.42 years for female students and 20.8 ± 2.13 years for male students. Total 20 (25.6%) students were found to be susceptible to Varicella with the confidence interval ranging from 15.8% to 35.4%. With respect to the gender of the students, the difference between the susceptibility percentage in female students (32%) and in male students (14.3%) was only a numerical difference and not statistically significant (χ(2) = 2.098, P=0.147, d.f. = 2). Also, the susceptibility was seen significantly more among Keralite students (Pearson Chi-Square=16.736, d.f=6, P=0.008; Likelihood Ratio=15.086, d.f=6, P=0.035; Fisher's Exact Test=13.569, p=0.022). The sensitivity of definite history of prior chickenpox infection as an indicator of immunity was only 55.17%, with C.I ranging from 43.9% to 66.4%, specificity was 80%, with C.I. ranging from 70.9% to 86%, and positive predictive value was 88.8% with C.I of 81.7% to 89% and negative predictive value of history of 66.6% with C.I. of 56% to 77.2%.
CONCLUSION: Total 20 (25.6%) students were found to be susceptible to Varicella with the confidence interval ranging from 15.8% to 35.4%. Thus, there is a need for vaccination of all susceptible individuals. Definite history of prior chickenpox infection is not a reliable indicator of immunity against the same. The investigators recommend screening for IgG antibodies against Varicella of all students selected for the M.B.B.S.

21571717,Vaccination during pregnancy.,"QUESTION: One of my patients is studying to become a dental hygienist. Owing to the program requirements, she received several vaccinations last week, including measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B (HB) vaccines, as well as a tetanus booster. However, today a blood test confirmed that she is currently 6 weeks pregnant. What is known about the safety of these vaccines during pregnancy, and are there any general recommendations for vaccines for women who are planning to become pregnant or who are currently pregnant?
ANSWER: The combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and the varicella vaccine are live attenuated vaccines, and are contraindicated during pregnancy owing to theoretical concerns. However, there is no evidence that there are increased risks of malformations, congenital rubella syndrome, or varicella syndrome attributable to these vaccines. The HB and tetanus vaccines are composed of noninfectious particles or toxoids, and theoretically should cause no increased risk to the developing fetus. In addition, limited observational data also support no increased risk of any adverse pregnancy outcomes; consequently, administration of the HB and tetanus vaccines might be, if indicated, considered during pregnancy.","['Bozzo P', 'Narducci A', 'Einarson A']",2011,57,5,Can Fam Physician,"Bozzo P, et al.

21569228,Varicella-zoster virus infections in immunocompromised patients - a single centre 6-years analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) contemporaneously with malignant disease or immunosuppression represents a particular challenge and requires individualized decisions and treatment. Although the increasing use of varicella-vaccines in the general population and rapid initiation of VZV-immunoglobulins and acyclovir in case of exposure has been beneficial for some patients, immunocompromised individuals are still at risk for unfavourable courses.
METHODS: In this single center, 6-year analysis we review incidence, hospitalization and complication rates of VZV-infections in our center and compare them to published data. Furthermore, we report three instructive cases.
RESULTS: Hospitalization rate of referred children with VZV-infections was 45%, among these 17% with malignancies and 9% under immunosuppressive therapy. Rate of complications was not elevated in these two high-risk cohorts, but one ALL-patient died due to VZV-related complications. We report one 4-year old boy with initial diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia who showed a rapidly fatal outcome of his simultaneous varicella-infection, one 1.8-year old boy with an identical situation but a mild course of his disease, and an 8.5-year old boy with a steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. This boy developed severe hepatic involvement during his varicella-infection but responded to immediate withdrawl of steroids and administration of acyclovir plus single-dose cidofovir after nonresponse to acyclovir after 48 h.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that patients with malignant diseases or immunosuppressive therapy should be hospitalized and treated immediately with antiviral agents. Despite these measures the course of VZV-infections can be highly variable in these patients. We discuss aids to individual decision-making for these difficult situations.","['Wiegering V', 'Schick J', 'Beer M', 'Weissbrich B', 'Gattenlöhner S', 'Girschick HJ', 'Liese J', 'Schlegel PG', 'Eyrich M']",2011,11,,BMC Pediatr,"Wiegering V, et al.

Three vaccine brands (Varivax from Sanofi Pasteur MSD; Varilrix and Priorix-Tetra, both from Glaxo-Smith-Kline) are licensed in Germany and have been associated with both different degrees of vaccine effectiveness and adverse effects. To identify genetic variants in the vaccines that might contribute to rash-associated syndromes, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles of variants from the three vaccines and rash-associated vaccine-type VZV from German vaccinees were quantitatively compared by PCR-based pyrosequencing (PSQ). The Varivax vaccine contained an estimated 3-fold higher diversity of VZV variants, with 20% more wild-type (wt) SNPs than Varilrix and Priorix-Tetra. These minor VZV variants in the vaccines were identified by analyzing cloned full-length open reading frame (ORF) orf62 sequences by chain termination sequencing and PSQ. Some of these sequences amplified from vaccine VZV were very similar or identical to those of the rash-associated vaccine-type VZV from vaccinees and were almost exclusively detected in Varivax. Therefore, minorities of rash-associated VZV variants are present in varicella vaccine formulations, and it can be concluded that the analysis of a core set of four SNPs is required as a minimum for a firm diagnostic differentiation of vaccine-type VZV from wt VZV.","['Thiele S', 'Borschewski A', 'Küchler J', 'Bieberbach M', 'Voigt S', 'Ehlers B']",2011,18,7,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Thiele S, et al.

Data on levels of maternal acquired antibodies according to infants' age were extracted from a cohort of 345 full term infants enrolled in a prospective multicenter study in seven pediatric wards and/or pediatric emergency units. Among infants hospitalized for varicella complications, the overall prevalence of complications increased regularly from 10.4% in infants below 1 month of age to over 72.4% at 5 months of age. Conversely, the mean antibody titre decreased from 536 mIU/mL in the [0-1 [month group to below the 150 mIU/mL threshold at 3-4 months [Pearson coefficient = -0.956 (p < 0.001)]. Based on large numbers of infants, our results show for the first time, a strong inverse correlation between the levels of circulating anti-VZV maternal antibodies in full term infants and occurrence of varicella complications below one year of age. Infant protection could be optimized by increasing herd immunity, reducing the susceptibility of women in childbearing age and lowering the age of routine vaccination to 9 months. Additional vaccination for unprotected persons in close contact with infants below 12 months of age could be promoted.","['Pinquier D', 'Lécuyer A', 'Levy C', 'Gagneur A', 'Pradat P', 'Soubeyrand B', 'Grimprel E', 'Pediatricians Working Group']",2011,7,5,Hum Vaccin,"Pinquier D, et al.

The smears were stained using Pappenheim's method. The peculiarity of buccal mucosa cytograms of children of different ages was the significant increase in mature forms of the cells (presence of differentiation stage 5 and 6 cells) in adolescents. They also had a lower area of epitheliocytes at all the stages of differentiation and of their nuclei. In chronic tonsillitis and chicken pox, the complex of cytological changes was detected, that included the increase of the leukocyte number, changes in the proportions of epitheliocytes in cell population, augmentation of inflammation-destruction and destruction indexes.","['Kurkin AV', 'Rybalkina DKh']",2011,139,1,Morfologiia,Kurkin AV and Rybalkina DKh.

21525352,Varicella-zoster virus infection of differentiated human neural stem cells.,"Primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection in humans produces varicella (chickenpox), after which the virus becomes latent in ganglionic neurons. Analysis of the physical state of viral nucleic acid and virus gene expression during latency requires postmortem acquisition of fresh human ganglia. To provide an additional way to study the VZV-host relationship in neurons, we developed an in vitro model of infected differentiated human neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs were induced to differentiate in culture dishes coated with poly-l-lysine and mouse laminin in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and retinoic acid. Immunostaining with neuronal (MAP2a and β-tubulin), astrocyte (GFAP), and oligodendrocyte (CNPase) markers revealed that differentiated neurons constituted approximately 90% of the cell population. These neurons were maintained in culture for up to 8 weeks. No cytopathic effect (CPE) developed in neurons infected with cell-free VZV (Zostavax vaccine) compared to human fetal lung fibroblasts infected with VZV. Weeks later, VZV DNA virus-specific transcripts (open reading frames [ORFs] 21, 29, 62, and 63) were detected in infected neurons, and dual immunofluorescence staining revealed the presence of VZV IE63 and gE exclusively in healthy-appearing neurons, but not in astrocytes. Neither the tissue culture medium nor a homogenate prepared from VZV-infected neurons produced a CPE in fibroblasts. VZV induced apoptosis in fibroblasts, as shown by activation of caspase 3 and by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, but not in neurons. This model provides a unique in vitro system to study the VZV-neuronal relationship.","['Pugazhenthi S', 'Nair S', 'Velmurugan K', 'Liang Q', 'Mahalingam R', 'Cohrs RJ', 'Nagel MA', 'Gilden D']",2011,85,13,J Virol,"Pugazhenthi S, et al.

21524760,[Susceptibility to varicella among health care workers. Acceptability and response to vaccination].,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of health care workers (HCW) susceptibility to varicella zoster virus (VZV). As a secondary objective, we describe the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the vaccine.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A multicenter analytic cross-sectional study was conducted in 5 hospitals in Catalonia, Spain, in a total of 1,111 HCW, aged between 18-60 years. We studied the prevalence of anti-VZV antibodies (IgG) and obtained demographic, occupational and health related variables that were expected to be associated with immunogenicity, as well as past history of varicella. All susceptible HCW were vaccinated and we studied the immunogenicity (antibody detection) and reactogenicity of the 1st and 2nd doses of the vaccine. Detection of antibodies against VZV was obtained by ELISA. All negative results were confirmed with FAMA.
RESULTS: Forty two subjects (3.8%) were negative. Susceptibility to VZV was associated (p<0.05) with decreased age (29.6 years ± 8.5 vs. 32,5 ± 9,3 in non-susceptible individuals), having fewer siblings and having no previous clinical history of varicella. Postvaccination detection tests with ELISA showed a seroconversion rate of 52 and 86% after the 1st and 2nd doses of the vaccine respectively, and 100% when using FAMA. There were no significant adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility to varicella among HCW is low. Positive past history of varicella is a good predictor of previous exposure to VZV, since 99% (687/696) of the individuals that declared having experienced the disease were immune. This would avoid prevaccination screening in nearly two thirds of HCW.","['García-Basteiro AL', 'Bayas JM', 'Campins M', 'Torres M', 'Serra C', 'Varela P', 'Barbé E', 'Vidal J', 'Grupo de Estudio de la Varicela en Hospitales de Cataluña']",2011,137,8,Med Clin (Barc),"García-Basteiro AL, et al.

21513563,Ultra-violet radiation is responsible for the differences in global epidemiology of chickenpox and the evolution of varicella-zoster virus as man migrated out of Africa.,"BACKGROUND: Of the eight human herpes viruses, varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and zoster, has a unique epidemiology. Primary infection is much less common in children in the tropics compared with temperate areas. This results in increased adult susceptibility causing outbreaks, for example in health-care workers migrating from tropical to temperate countries. The recent demonstration that there are different genotypes of varicella-zoster virus and their geographic segregation into tropical and temperate areas suggests a distinct, yet previously unconsidered climatic factor may be responsible for both the clinical and molecular epidemiological features of this virus infection.
PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Unlike other human herpes viruses, varicella-zoster virus does not require intimate contact for infection to occur indicating that transmission may be interrupted by a geographically restricted climatic factor. The factor with the largest difference between tropical and temperate zones is ultra-violet radiation. This could reduce the infectiousness of chickenpox cases by inactivating virus in vesicles, before or after rupture. This would explain decreased transmissibility in the tropics and why the peak chickenpox incidence in temperate zones occurs during winter and spring, when ultra-violet radiation is at its lowest. The evolution of geographically restricted genotypes is also explained by ultra-violet radiation driving natural selection of different virus genotypes with varying degrees of resistance to inactivation, tropical genotypes being the most resistant. Consequently, temperate viruses should be more sensitive to its effects. This is supported by the observation that temperate genotypes are found in the tropics only in specific circumstances, namely where ultra-violet radiation has either been excluded or significantly reduced in intensity.
TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The hypothesis is testable by exposing different virus genotypes to ultra-violet radiation and quantifying virus survival by plaque forming units or quantitative mRNA RT-PCR.
IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The ancestral varicella-zoster virus, most probably a tropical genotype, co-migrated with man as he left Africa approximately 200,000 years ago. For this virus to have lost the selective advantage of resistance to ultra-violet radiation, the hypothesis would predict that the temperate, ultra-violet sensitive virus should have acquired another selective advantage as an evolutionary trade-off. One obvious advantage could be an increased reactivation rate as zoster to set up more rounds of chickenpox transmission. If this were so, the mechanism responsible for resistance to ultra-violet radiation might also be involved in reactivation and latency. This could then provide the first insight into a genetic correlate of the survival strategy of this virus.",['Rice PS'],2011,8,,Virol J,Rice PS.

21508586,Fractional lasers in dermatology--current status and recommendations.,"INTRODUCTION: Fractional laser technology is a new emerging technology to improve scars, fine lines, dyspigmentation, striae and wrinkles. The technique is easy, safe to use and has been used effectively for several clinical and cosmetic indications in Indian skin.
DEVICES: Different fractional laser machines, with different wavelengths, both ablative and non-ablative, are now available in India. A detailed understanding of the device being used is recommended.
INDICATIONS: Common indications include resurfacing for acne, chickenpox and surgical scars, periorbital and perioral wrinkles, photoageing changes, facial dyschromias. The use of fractional lasers in stretch marks, melasma and other pigmentary conditions, dermatological conditions such as granuloma annulare has been reported. But further data are needed before adopting them for routine use in such conditions.
PHYSICIAN QUALIFICATION: Any qualified dermatologist may administer fractional laser treatment. He/ she should possess a Master's degree or diploma in dermatology and should have had specific hands-on training in lasers, either during postgraduation or later at a facility which routinely performs laser procedures under a competent dermatologist or plastic surgeon with experience and training in using lasers. Since parameters may vary with different systems, specific training tailored towards the concerned device at either the manufacturer's facility or at another center using the machine is recommended.
FACILITY: Fractional lasers can be used in the dermatologist's minor procedure room for the above indications.
PREOPERATIVE COUNSELING AND INFORMED CONSENT: Detailed counseling with respect to the treatment, desired effects and possible postoperative complications should be provided to the patient. The patient should be provided brochures to study and also adequate opportunity to seek information. A detailed consent form needs to be completed by the patient. Consent form should include information on the machine, possible postoperative course expected and postoperative complications. Preoperative photography should be carried out in all cases of resurfacing. A close-up front and 45-degree lateral photographs of both sides must be taken.
LASER PARAMETERS: There are different machines based on different technologies available. Choice parameters depend on the type of machine, location and type of lesion, and skin color. Physician needs to be familiar with these requirements before using the machine.
ANESTHESIA: Fractional laser treatment can be carried out under topical anesthesia with eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine. Some machines can be used without any anesthesia or only with topical cooling or cryospray. But for maximal patient comfort, a topical anesthetic prior to the procedure is recommended.
POSTOPERATIVE CARE: Proper postoperative care is important in avoiding complications. Post-treatment edema and redness settle in a few hours to a few days. A sunscreen is mandatory, and emollients may be prescribed for the dryness and peeling that could occur.","['Goel A', 'Krupashankar DS', 'Aurangabadkar S', 'Nischal KC', 'Omprakash HM', 'Mysore V']",2011,77,3,Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol,"Goel A, et al.

Her clinical condition remained stable over the past 10 years without infections, any granulomatous disease, or autoimmunity. Immunophenotyping demonstrated strongly reduced naive T and B cells with intact proliferative capacity. Antibody reactivity on in vivo immunizations was normal. T-cell receptor-Vβ repertoire was polyclonal with a very low content of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). Kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) were also abnormal in the B cells. Both reflect extensive in vivo proliferation. Patient-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells could not repopulate RAG2(-/-)IL2Rγc(-/-) mice, indicating the lymphoid origin of the defect. We identified 2 novel missense mutations in RAG1 (p.Arg474Cys and p.Leu506Phe) resulting in reduced RAG activity. This report gives the first genetic clue for ICL and extends the clinical spectrum of RAG mutations from severe immune defects to an almost normal condition.","['Kuijpers TW', 'Ijspeert H', 'van Leeuwen EM', 'Jansen MH', 'Hazenberg MD', 'Weijer KC', 'van Lier RA', 'van der Burg M']",2011,117,22,Blood,"Kuijpers TW, et al.

21489733,[Current events in vaccination].,"The annual meeting of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA); which brought together nearly 5000 participants from over 80 countries in Vancouver, Canada, October 21 to 24, 2010; provided a review of the influenza (H1N1) 2009 pandemic, evaluated vaccination programmes and presented new vaccines under development. With 12,500 deaths in the United States in 2009-2010, the influenza (H1N1) 2009 pandemic was actually less deadly than the seasonal flu. But it essentially hit the young, and the toll calculated in years of life lost is high. The monovalent vaccines, whether live attenuated or inactivated with or without adjuvants, were well tolerated in toddlers, children, adults and pregnant women. In order to protect infants against pertussis, family members are urged to get their booster shots. The introduction of the 13-valent Pneumococcal conjugated vaccine in the beginning of 2010 may solve--but for how long?--the problem of serotype replacement, responsible for the re-increasing incidence of invasive Pneumococcal infections observed in countries that had introduced the 7-valent vaccine. The efficacy of a rotavirus vaccine has been confirmed, with a reduction in hospitalization in the United States and a reduction in gastroenteritis-related deaths in Mexico. In the United States, vaccination of pre-adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV) has not resulted in any specific undesirable effects. Routine vaccination against chicken pox, recommended since 1995, has not had an impact on the evolution of the incidence of shingles. Vaccination against shingles, recommended in the United States for subjects 60 years and over, shows an effectiveness of 55%, according to a cohort study (Kaiser Permanente, Southern California). Although some propose the development of personalized vaccines according to individual genetic characteristics, the priority remains with increasing vaccine coverage, not only in infants but also in adults and the elderly. Vaccine calendars that cover a whole lifetime should be promoted, since the vaccination of adults and seniors is a determining factor of good health at all ages.","['Aubert M', 'Aumaître H', 'Beytout J', 'Bloch K', 'Bouhour D', 'Callamand P', 'Chave C', 'Cheymol J', 'Combadière B', 'Dahlab A', 'Denis F', 'De Pontual L', 'Dodet B', 'Dommergues MA', 'Dufour V', 'Gagneur A', 'Gaillat J', 'Gaudelus J', 'Gavazzi G', 'Gillet Y', 'Gras-le-Guen C', 'Haas H', 'Hanslik T', 'Hau-Rainsard I', 'Larnaudie S', 'Launay O', 'Lorrot M', 'Loulergue P', 'Malvy D', 'Marchand S', 'Picherot G', 'Pinquier D', 'Pulcini C', 'Rabaud C', 'Regnier F', 'Reinert P', 'Sana C', 'Savagner C', 'Soubeyrand B', 'Stephan JL', 'Strady C', 'Groupe Avancées Vaccinales France']",2011,41,5,Med Mal Infect,"Aubert M, et al.

21486500,Chickenpox.,"INTRODUCTION: Chickenpox is extremely contagious. Over 90% of unvaccinated people become infected, but infection occurs at different ages in different parts of the world - over 80% of people have been infected by the age of 10 years in the US, the UK, and Japan, and by the age of 20 to 30 years in India, South East Asia, and the West Indies.
METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent chickenpox in healthy adults and children? What are the effects of interventions to prevent chickenpox in children exposed prenatally? What are the effects of interventions to prevent chickenpox in immunocompromised adults and children? What are the effects of treatments for chickenpox in healthy adults and children? What are the effects of treatments for chickenpox in immunocompromised adults and children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
RESULTS: We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aciclovir, famciclovir, live attenuated vaccine, valaciclovir, and varicella zoster immunoglobulin.","['Breuer J', 'Fifer H']",2011,2011,,BMJ Clin Evid,Breuer J and Fifer H.

21486458,An outbreak of varicella among schoolchildren in Taipei.,"BACKGROUND: The reported cases with varicella have not decreased and outbreaks of varicella among vaccinated children continue to be reported 9 years after the public vaccination program in Taipei. We investigated an outbreak to determine varicella vaccine coverage and effectiveness.
METHODS: An outbreak occurred in an elementary school which located in southern Taipei from April 2007 through May 2007. A retrospect cohort study was performed by using a self-administered questionnaire for parents.
RESULTS: Ten out of sixteen varicella cases were vaccinated. Overall vaccine coverage was 71.2%. The common reasons for not receiving varicella vaccine were that varicella vaccine was unavailable because the student didn't live in Taipei (29.4%) or the children could not be vaccinated due to certain illnesses (23.5%). The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported vaccination status was 0.900 (95% CI: 0.864, 0.935) and 0.611 (95% CI: 0.514, 0.701).The vaccine effectiveness was 69.3%-100.0% against any disease severity of varicella. Overall vaccine effectiveness against moderate or severe varicella was 85.5%. Attending cram school was associated with the risk of developing the varicella illness (RR: 13.39; 95% CI: 5.38, 33.31). Unvaccinated students tended to show moderate to severe (>50 lesions) afflictions of the disease (RR: 4.17; 95% CI: 1.15, 15.14).
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the low vaccination coverage, varicella outbreaks continue to be reported in Taipei. Increasing vaccine coverage and second dose vaccination for increasing vaccine effectiveness may be considered.","['Lai CC', 'Chen SC', 'Jiang DD']",2011,11,,BMC Public Health,"Lai CC, et al.

21484478,Synthesis and decay of varicella zoster virus transcripts.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is highly cell-associated. At least 68 VZV open reading frames (ORFs) are transcribed in varying amounts that increase as infection progresses. Using reverse transcriptase PCR, quantification of total and newly synthesized mRNA showed that ongoing VZV DNA replication is required for continued accumulation of VZV ORF 63, 9, and 40 transcripts. Analysis of stability of 4-thiouridine-labeled transcripts of nine VZV ORFs revealed a similar half-life for all VZV ORFs tested. Thus, difference in mRNA synthesis, and not mRNA decay, is the major factor contributing to the difference in the relative abundance of VZV transcripts in infected cells.","['Azarkh Y', 'Dölken L', 'Nagel M', 'Gilden D', 'Cohrs RJ']",2011,17,3,J Neurovirol,"Azarkh Y, et al.

21466668,Hospitalization due to varicella in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, incidence of physician's consultations and hospitalizations for varicella is low compared to other countries. Better knowledge about the severity of varicella among Dutch hospitalized patients is needed. Therefore, a medical record research was conducted among hospitalized patients with diagnosis varicella.
METHODS: Hospital admissions due to varicella in 2003-2006 were obtained from the National Medical Register. Retrospectively, additional data were retrieved from the medical record of patients hospitalized with varicella in 23 Dutch hospitals using a standardized form. Analyses were performed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: The study population (N = 296) was representative for all varicella admissions in the Netherlands (N = 1,658) regarding age, sex, duration of admission and type of diagnosis. Complications were recorded in 76% of the patients (37% had at least one relatively severe complication). Bacterial super infections of skin lesions (28%), (imminent) dehydration (19%), febrile convulsions (7%), pneumonia (7%) and gastroenteritis (7%) were most frequently reported. No varicella-related death occurred within the study population and 3% of the patients had serious rest symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: It is not likely that the severity of varicella among hospitalized patients in the Netherlands differs from other countries. A considerable part of the varicella complications among hospitalized patients was rather moderate and can be treated effectively, although in a third of the hospitalized cases with complications, severe complications occurred. These data are relevant in the decision-making process regarding whether or not to introduce routine varicella vaccination in the Netherlands.","['van Lier A', 'van der Maas NA', 'Rodenburg GD', 'Sanders EA', 'de Melker HE']",2011,11,,BMC Infect Dis,"van Lier A, et al.

Laboratory testing to determine VZV immune status of pregnant women exposed to varicella is recommended. Quantitative assays are now available which are sensitive and specific. More than 200 consecutive requests for screening in pregnant patients with recent varicella contacts were followed-up by questionnaire. DiaSorin LIAISON and VZV time resolved fluorescence immuno assay (VZV TRFIA) were used to measure VZV antibody level. One hundred fifty out of 209 (72%) questionnaires were returned; 14 patients developed varicella, 129 did not and seven were not known. Patients who had been given VZIG and developed varicella on follow-up had a mean antibody level before VZIG of 28 mIU/ml and 62 mIU/ml, by LIAISON and TRFIA, respectively. The mean IgG level of those that did not develop varicella was 885 and 866 mIU/ml by LIAISON and TRFIA, respectively. Those with levels <100 mIU/ml were more likely to develop chicken pox than those with levels >100 mIU/ml (relative risk of 10.4 for LIAISON and 8.8 for TRFIA). On the basis of the relatively small numbers in this study, quantitative assays, using a 100mIU/ml cut-off, can differentiate between those who are susceptible and those who are protected against exposure, however follow-up studies should include sampling for VZV DNA and IgM.","['Boxall EH', 'Maple PA', 'Rathod P', 'Smit E']",2011,30,10,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Boxall EH, et al.

However, there is a lack of consensus on the best means of achieving this. Here, we review the existing evidence in relation to postexposure prophylaxis against varicella in this group and summarize data regarding the role of active vaccination.
RECENT FINDINGS: Death from varicella during treatment for cancer is now rare, but VZV disease and its prevention remain significant problems in paediatric oncology practice. Measures to reduce VZV exposure amongst seronegative individuals are often neglected. When exposure is known to have occurred, early administration of varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) is generally protective against severe and complicated varicella. However, many centres in the UK and Japan use an oral antiviral agent, aciclovir, in place of VZIG. Published evidence for the efficacy of aciclovir as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) relates mostly to healthy children, with no controlled studies in the immunocompromised.
SUMMARY: Good evidence already supports the administration of varicella vaccine to healthy susceptible family contacts of children with malignancy, but not to patients themselves. Further data are urgently needed to inform the choice of PEP against VZV in the immunocompromised.","['Fisher JP', 'Bate J', 'Hambleton S']",2011,24,3,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Fisher JP, et al.

It is characterized clinically by tense bullae arising both on lichen planus papules and on uninvolved skin, histologically by the demonstration of subepidermal bullae and by linear deposits of immunoglobulin G and C3 along the basement membrane zone on immunofluorescence of peribullous skin. Some authors consider LPP as the combination of lichen planus and bullous pemphigoid.

21449725,Exploring the impact of exposure to primary varicella in children on varicella-zoster virus immunity of parents.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes both primary varicella, and through reactivation of the virus, herpes zoster. It is hypothesized that VZV-immune adults may reduce the probability of developing herpes zoster through exposure to varicella. In this study we examine the existence of immunological boosting in VZV-immune adults after close contact with primary varicella. We followed-up 18 parents with household exposure to primary varicella for 1 y. Fifteen age-matched healthy and 20 older volunteers served as control groups. Cellular (IFN-γ ELISPOT) and humoral responses were measured. Data analyses were performed by t-tests and linear mixed models. The young control group only showed higher cellular responses than the older control group and the exposed group 1 mo after exposure. The exposed group had a strong tendency toward higher cellular responses compared to the older control group, reaching significance 1 y post-exposure. The best fitting linear mixed model predicts a decline in cellular response of 50% between 1 wk and 1 mo post-exposure, followed by an increase to attain an 80% higher level at 1 y compared to the first week post-exposure. No significant results emerged based on the humoral response of the individual parents in the exposed group, despite a general tendency toward higher antibody concentrations in the exposed versus the control groups. No significant difference in humoral immunity was found between the control groups. One year after initial re-exposure to VZV, VZV-immune adults showed a rise in cellular response as assessed by IFN-γ ELISPOT, and steady-state levels for the humoral response.","['Ogunjimi B', 'Smits E', 'Hens N', 'Hens A', 'Lenders K', 'Ieven M', 'Van Tendeloo V', 'Van Damme P', 'Beutels P']",2011,24,2,Viral Immunol,"Ogunjimi B, et al.

To be efficacious, general practitioners are in the front line to provide preventive care and health education. The perinatal period represents a privileged situation from listening to this approach of vaccine prevention. The raising awareness around the birth contains several additional steps to bring to the future mother and child the best protection against infectious diseases with vaccine prevention. By being vaccinated, parents and other family members indirectly provide protection to very young infants until they are old enough to be vaccinated and so directly protected themselves. Numerous opportunities exist to make sensitive the parents in this preventive way, for them and their child, whether it is from the adolescence in the adulthood above all parental project, on the occasion of a pregnancy, at birth, during the stay in maternity hospital, or along the first weeks of the postpartum. The general practitioner is the key actor to coordinate this global approach in perinatal health around the mother, his child and his family.

21420656,Household size is critical to varicella-zoster virus transmission in the tropics despite lower viral infectivity.,"The epidemiology and severity of infections can vary dramatically in different geographical regions. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a particularly tractable model for investigating such global differences, since infections can be unambiguously identified. VZV is spread by aerosol to cause chickenpox, which, in temperate countries, is a relatively benign childhood infection; yet in tropical countries it tends to occur at later age, a trend associated with markedly increased severity including complications, hospitalization, and overall burden of care. To investigate global differences in the epidemiology of chickenpox we studied a population in Guinea Bissau, which in contrast to other tropical countries has an unexpectedly early age of infection with VZV, comparable to temperate latitudes. In this study we used detailed records from over 3000 houses during an outbreak of chickenpox, combined with viral genetic information on routes of infection, to obtain precise estimates of disease transmission within and between houses. This community contains many large households in which different families live under a single roof, in living quarters divided by partitions. Our data show that household infectivity in tropical Guinea Bissau is reduced four-fold compared with temperate climates (14.8% versus 61-85%), with an intermediate rate between members of the same family who are in more intimate contact (23.5%). All else being equal, these lower infection rates would be expected to lead to a later age of infection as is commonly seen in other tropical countries. The young age of infection, which had drawn our attention to the Guinea Bissau population, can however be explained by the exceptionally large household sizes (mean 14.5 people). We have combined genetic and demographic data to show that the epidemiology of chickenpox in tropical Guinea Bissau is dependent on the interaction of the social and physical environments. The distinctive clinical presentation of VZV and its ubiquitous distribution make it an attractive model for estimating the variables that contribute to global differences in the transmission of airborne viruses.","['Nichols RA', 'Averbeck KT', 'Poulsen AG', 'al Bassam MM', 'Cabral F', 'Aaby P', 'Breuer J']",2011,3,1,Epidemics,"Nichols RA, et al.

21412895,Vaccines for prophylaxis of viral infections in patients with hematological malignancies.,"BACKGROUND: Viral infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. It remains uncertain whether viral vaccinations in these patients are supported by good evidence.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of viral vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (June 2010), reference lists of relevant papers, abstracts from scientific meetings and contacted vaccine manufacturers.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating viral vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies were included.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Relative risk (RR) was used for binary data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. Primary outcome was incidence of infection. Secondary outcomes were mortality, incidence of complications and severe viral infection, hospitalization, immune response and adverse effects. Fixed-effect model was used in meta-analyses.
MAIN RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included, with 305 patients in the intervention groups and 288 in the control groups. They evaluated heat-inactivated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (two trials), influenza vaccines (five trials) and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) (one trial). Seven trials had high and one trial had moderate risk of bias.VZV vaccine might reduce herpes zoster compared to no vaccine (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0, P=0.05), but not statistically significant. Vaccination also demonstrated efficacy in immune response but frequently caused local adverse effects. One trial reported severity score of zoster, which favored vaccination (MD 2.6, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.26, P=0.002).Two RCTs compared inactivated influenza vaccine with no vaccine and reported lower risk of lower respiratory infections (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78, P=0.008) and hospitalization (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.31, P<0.00001) in vaccine recipients. However, vaccine recipients more frequently experienced irritability and local adverse effects. There was no significant difference in seroconversion between one and two doses of influenza vaccine (one trial), or between recombinant and standard influenza vaccine (one trial), or influenza vaccine given with or without re-induction chemotherapy (one trial).The IPV trial comparing vaccination starting at 6 versus 18 months after stem cell transplant (SCT) found no significant difference in seroconversion.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Inactivated VZV vaccine might reduce zoster severity in adult SCT recipients. Inactivated influenza vaccine might reduce respiratory infections and hospitalization in adults with multiple myeloma or children with leukemia or lymphoma. However, the quality of evidence is low. Local adverse effects occur frequently. Further high-quality RCTs are needed.","['Cheuk DK', 'Chiang AK', 'Lee TL', 'Chan GC', 'Ha SY']",2011,,3,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Cheuk DK, et al.

21410679,Varicella-zoster virus immunity in dermatological patients on systemic immunosuppressant treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Primary varicella infection is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It is a common childhood infection, which is usually benign but can occasionally cause morbidity and mortality. In immunosuppressed adults, atypical presentation and disseminated disease can occur with significant morbidity and mortality. A VZV vaccine is available.
OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to measure the prevalence of immunity to VZV and to determine the predictive value of a self-reported history of varicella infection in a population of dermatological patients receiving systemic immunosuppressant therapy. We sought to assess the need for routine serological testing for varicella-zoster immunity in this cohort.
METHODS: Serological testing for VZV immunity was done on 228 patients receiving systemic immunosuppressive treatment for a dermatological condition. Information regarding a history of previous primary VZV infection was obtained from each patient.
RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight patients had VZV serology performed. The mean age of the patients was 49·6 years. The prevalence of VZV seropositivity in this cohort was 98·7%. One hundred and two patients (44·7%) reported having a definite history of primary VZV. The sensitivity of a self-reported history of VZV infection was 45·3% with a specificity of 100%. The positive and negative predictive values of a self-reported history of VZV for serologically confirmed immunity were 100% and 2·3%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of VZV IgG antibodies in our cohort of Irish dermatology patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy is 98·7%. A recalled history of varicella infection is a good predictor of serological immunity. This study has shown that there are VZV-susceptible individuals within our cohort. These patients did not have a clear history of previous infection. We recommend serological testing of patients without a clear history of infection prior to the commencement of immunosuppressive therapy and vaccination of patients with negative serology.","['Hackett CB', 'Wall D', 'Fitzgerald SF', 'Rogers S', 'Kirby B']",2011,164,6,Br J Dermatol,"Hackett CB, et al.

21385879,Varicella-zoster virus infection triggers formation of an interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-processing inflammasome complex.,"Innate cellular immunity is the immediate host response against pathogens, and activation of innate immunity also modulates the induction of adaptive immunity. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) are a family of intracellular receptors that recognize conserved patterns associated with intracellular pathogens, but information about their role in the host defense against DNA viruses is limited. Here we report that varicella-zoster virus (VZV), an alphaherpesvirus that is the causative agent of varicella and herpes zoster, induces formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the associated processing of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β by activated caspase-1 in infected cells. NLRP3 inflammasome formation was induced in VZV-infected human THP-1 cells, which are a transformed monocyte cell line, primary lung fibroblasts, and melanoma cells. Absent in melanoma gene-2 (AIM2) is an interferon-inducible protein that can form an alternative inflammasome complex with caspase-1 in virus-infected cells. Experiments in VZV-infected melanoma cells showed that NLRP3 protein recruits the adaptor protein ASC and caspase-1 to form an NLRP3 inflammasome complex independent of AIM2 protein and in the absence of free radical reactive oxygen species release. NLRP3 was also expressed extensively in infected skin xenografts in the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model of VZV pathogenesis in vivo. We conclude that NLRP3 inflammasome formation is an innate cellular response to infection with this common pathogenic human herpesvirus.","['Nour AM', 'Reichelt M', 'Ku CC', 'Ho MY', 'Heineman TC', 'Arvin AM']",2011,286,20,J Biol Chem,"Nour AM, et al.

This study was undertaken to generate safety and immunogenicity data for two doses of MMRV vaccine administered according to dose schedules using the shortest permitted interval of 4 weeks versus a longer interval of 12 months, which would allow flexible adaptation to local immunization calendars.
METHODS: Healthy children aged 11-13 months were randomized (1:1:1) to receive 2 doses of either: MMRV vaccine with a 4-week interval between doses (MMRV-4W group, N=188), MMRV vaccine with a 12-month interval between doses (MMRV-12M group, N=184), or MMR vaccine with a 4-week interval between doses (MMR group, N=187). Blood samples were taken prior to, and 4-6 weeks after each vaccination.
RESULTS: Post-Dose 2, both MMRV groups exhibited an adequate immunogenic response for all components; however the MMRV-12M group showed significantly greater geometric mean titers for mumps, rubella and varicella. Two varicella breakthrough cases occurred within the 12-month interval between doses in the MMRV-12M group. Local and general reactogenicity results were similar for all groups except for the MMRV-4W group, which had a greater incidence of fever during Days 0-14 post-Dose 1.

The differential diagnosis was varicella, meningitis or encephalitis and two days later, after she deteriorated neurologically, she received a lumbar puncture. Three days later she suffered a seizure and irreversible brain damage. A CT scan performed at that point showed a brain tumour. As Australia does not have a no-fault system providing compensation to cover the long-term care required for such a condition, the girl (through her parents and lawyers) sued her treating physician. She alleged that, because a cerebral CT scan was not performed when clinically indicated after the diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis and before the lumbar puncture, she had ""lost the chance"" to have her brain tumour treated before she sustained permanent brain damage. She succeeded at first instance, but lost on appeal. The High Court also rejected her claim, holding unanimously that there were no policy reasons to allow recovery of damages based on possible (less than 50%) ""loss of a chance"" of a better medical outcome. The court held that the law of torts in Australia required ""all or nothing"" proof that physical injury was caused or contributed to by a negligent party. The High Court, however, did not exclude loss of chance as forming the substance of a probable (greater than 50%) claim in medical negligence in some future case. In the meantime, patients injured in Australia as a result of possible medical negligence (particularly in the intractable difficult instances of late diagnosis) must face the injustice of the significant day-to-day care needs of victims being carried by family members and the taxpayer-funded public hospital system. The High Court in Tabet v Gett again provides evidence that, as currently constituted, it remains deaf to the injustice caused by State legislation excessively restricting the access to reasonable compensation by victims of medical negligence.","['Faunce T', 'McEwan A']",2010,18,2,J Law Med,Faunce T and McEwan A.

21349886,Congenital and neonatal varicella: impact of the national varicella vaccination programme in Australia.,"OBJECTIVE: Routine varicella zoster vaccination for children aged 18 months began in Australia from November 2005. The aim of this study was to compare the current incidence and outcomes of congenital and neonatal varicella in Australia with similarly collected data from 1995 to 1997.
METHODS: Active national prospective surveillance was carried out for congenital and neonatal varicella using the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU) for 3.5 years from June 2006. Around 1300 clinicians reported monthly according to predefined case criteria.
RESULTS: During the study period the mean monthly return rate of APSU report cards was 93.7%. Two cases of congenital varicella (0.19 per 100 000 live births per annum) and 16 cases of neonatal varicella (2.0 per 100 000 live births per annum) were identified. During 2008 and 2009 no cases of congenital varicella were reported; neonatal varicella rates declined to 0.7 per 100 000 live births per annum, a significant trend (p=0.005) and a reduction of over 85% compared with rates during 1995-1997 (the prevaccination era) and the first year of the current surveillance study. Eleven of 16 neonatal cases followed prenatal maternal infection; seven of the 11 infections were acquired from children, four of whom were living in the same household. Ten (62.5%) infants with neonatal varicella were admitted to hospital, one of whom developed varicella pneumonitis requiring ventilatory support, but none died. Only one infecting contact had been vaccinated.
CONCLUSIONS: There has been an apparent reduction of congenital varicella and a significant reduction of neonatal varicella in Australia following the introduction of universal varicella vaccination in 2005.","['Khandaker G', 'Marshall H', 'Peadon E', 'Zurynski Y', 'Burgner D', 'Buttery J', 'Gold M', 'Nissen M', 'Elliott EJ', 'Burgess M', 'Booy R']",2011,96,5,Arch Dis Child,"Khandaker G, et al.

Although the vaccine differs from the progenitor virus by over 40 mutations, only three of these are fixed, the rest being a mixture of the wildtype and the vaccine allele. To examine the extent of this variability between two of the three commercially available vaccine preparations, we analysed the vaccine/wildtype allele frequencies present at fifteen vaccine loci in five preparations each from two different manufacturers of the vOka vaccine. Our results suggest that differences in manufacturing processes between the two companies have resulted in significant variation in the frequencies of the vaccine/wildtype alleles in their vaccines. Yet despite these differences, the allele frequencies in the vaccines from the two companies are strongly correlated. We discuss the significance of these findings and the role of evolutionary processes that influence the production of this live attenuated vaccine.","['Kanda RK', 'Quinlivan ML', 'Gershon AA', 'Nichols RA', 'Breuer J']",2011,29,17,Vaccine,"Kanda RK, et al.

21345964,"Mutagenesis of varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein I (gI) identifies a cysteine residue critical for gE/gI heterodimer formation, gI structure, and virulence in skin cells.","Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the alphaherpesvirus that causes chicken pox (varicella) and shingles (zoster). The two VZV glycoproteins gE and gI form a heterodimer that mediates efficient cell-to-cell spread. Deletion of gI yields a small-plaque-phenotype virus, ΔgI virus, which is avirulent in human skin using the xenograft model of VZV pathogenesis. In the present study, 10 mutant viruses were generated to determine which residues were required for the typical function of gI. Three phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain of gI were not required for VZV virulence in vivo. Two deletion mutants mapped a gE binding region in gI to residues 105 to 125. A glycosylation site, N116, in this region did not affect virulence. Substitution of four cysteine residues highly conserved in the Alphaherpesvirinae established that C95 is required for gE/gI heterodimer formation. The C95A and Δ105-125 (with residues 105 to 125 deleted) viruses had small-plaque phenotypes with reduced replication kinetics in vitro similar to those of the ΔgI virus. The Δ105-125 virus was avirulent for human skin in vivo. In contrast, the C95A mutant replicated in vivo but with significantly reduced kinetics compared to those of the wild-type virus. In addition to abolished gE/gI heterodimer formation, gI from the C95A or the Δ105-125 mutant was not recognized by monoclonal antibodies that detect the canonical conformation of gI, demonstrating structural disruption of gI in these viruses. This alteration prevented gI incorporation into virus particles. Thus, residues C95 and 105 to 125 are critical for gI structure required for gE/gI heterodimer formation, virion incorporation, and ultimately, effective viral spread in human skin.","['Oliver SL', 'Sommer MH', 'Reichelt M', 'Rajamani J', 'Vlaycheva-Beisheim L', 'Stamatis S', 'Cheng J', 'Jones C', 'Zehnder J', 'Arvin AM']",2011,85,9,J Virol,"Oliver SL, et al.

21342215,Review: The neurobiology of varicella zoster virus infection.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic herpesvirus that infects nearly all humans. Primary infection usually causes chickenpox (varicella), after which virus becomes latent in cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia and autonomic ganglia along the entire neuraxis. Although VZV cannot be isolated from human ganglia, nucleic acid hybridization and, later, polymerase chain reaction proved that VZV is latent in ganglia. Declining VZV-specific host immunity decades after primary infection allows virus to reactivate spontaneously, resulting in shingles (zoster) characterized by pain and rash restricted to one to three dermatomes. Multiple other serious neurological and ocular disorders also result from VZV reactivation. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of the clinical and pathological complications of neurological and ocular disease produced by VZV reactivation, molecular aspects of VZV latency, VZV virology and VZV-specific immunity, the role of apoptosis in VZV-induced cell death and the development of an animal model provided by simian varicella virus infection of monkeys.","['Gilden D', 'Mahalingam R', 'Nagel MA', 'Pugazhenthi S', 'Cohrs RJ']",2011,37,5,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Gilden D, et al.

21339369,Infectious immune status in an obstetric population of Pakistani immigrants in Norway.,"AIM: To investigate cytomegalovirus, rubella, varicella, toxoplasma, and hepatitis B immune status and factors associated with susceptibility for infections among Pakistani pregnant women in Norway.
METHODS: A total of 206 pregnant Pakistani women living in Norway participated in the evaluation. Blood samples were collected during pregnancy and tested for IgG antibodies against cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, varicella-zoster virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and hepatitis B (HB) virus.
RESULTS: All women had IgG antibodies against cytomegalovirus. Positivity for rubella IgG was 92%, 93% had varicella IgG antibodies, while 17% had toxoplasma IgG. Eleven per cent were anti-HBc positive, one of whom was HBsAg positive, which means that blood and cervix secretions are infectious with risk of virus transmission to the baby at the time of birth. Six women were only anti-HBc positive, they may have low-level HB infection, and risk of transmission cannot be excluded. Age younger than 25 years, having less than two children, and having lived less than 5 years in Norway were factors significantly associated with varicella-seronegative status, and thus susceptible for primary infection.
CONCLUSIONS: To decrease the incidence of neonatal and maternal morbidity related to rubella, varicella, toxoplasma, and hepatitis B in our Pakistani immigrant population, we should intensify our rubella antenatal screening programme and focus upon rubella vaccination postpartum. We should offer varicella-seronegative women immunisation, advise toxoplasma-seronegative women to avoid visit to their home country during pregnancy, and give hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns regardless of maternal HBsAg status.","['Bjerke SE', 'Vangen S', 'Holter E', 'Stray-Pedersen B']",2011,39,5,Scand J Public Health,"Bjerke SE, et al.

21313847,Protection against infectious laryngotracheitis by in ovo vaccination with commercially available viral vector recombinant vaccines.,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens caused by infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). The disease is mainly controlled through biosecurity and by vaccination with live-attenuated vaccines. The chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines, although proven to be effective in experimental settings, have limited efficacy in controlling the disease in dense broiler production sites due to unrestricted use and poor mass vaccination coverage. These factors allowed CEO vaccines to regain virulence, causing long lasting and, consequently, severe outbreaks of the disease. A new generation of viral vector fowl poxvirus (FPV) and herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) vaccines carrying ILTV genes has been developed and such vaccines are commercially available. These vaccines are characterized by their lack of transmission, lack of ILTV-associated latent infections, and no reversion to virulence. HVT-vectored ILTV recombinant vaccines were originally approved for subcutaneous HVT or transcutaneous (pox) delivery. The increased incidence of ILTV outbreaks in broiler production sites encouraged the broiler industry to deliver the FPV-LT and HVT-LT recombinant vaccines in ovo. The objective of this study was to evaluate the protection induced by ILTV viral vector recombinant vaccines after in ovo application in 18-day-old commercial broiler embryos. The protection induced by recombinant ILTV vaccines was assessed by their ability to prevent clinical signs and mortality; to reduce challenge virus replication in the trachea; to prevent an increase in body temperature; and to prevent a decrease in body weight gain after challenge. In this study, both recombinant-vectored ILTV vaccines provided partial protection, thereby mitigating the disease, but did not reduce challenge virus loads in the trachea.","['Johnson DI', 'Vagnozzi A', 'Dorea F', 'Riblet SM', 'Mundt A', 'Zavala G', 'García M']",2010,54,4,Avian Dis,"Johnson DI, et al.

21284916,In utero exposure to virus infections and the risk of developing anorexia nervosa.,"BACKGROUND: The study aims to explore, using indirect ecological measures of exposure, the role of viral infections in the development of anorexia nervosa (AN).
METHOD: The cohort of participants consisted of all female subjects born in the Veneto region in the period between 1970 and 1984, and residing in the urban and suburban area of Padua (27,682 female subjects in an area of 424 km2). The main outcome measure was the diagnosis of AN resulting from the Public Mental Health Database, the Register of Hospital Admissions, and the Register of the Eating Disorders Unit (n=402, 1.4%). The number of cases of rubella, chickenpox, influenza and measles was ascertained for each month for the 15-year period.
RESULTS: Exposures during the sixth month of pregnancy to the peaks of chickenpox [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.0] and rubella infections (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing AN, even after controlling for socio-economic status, urbanization and month of birth. We found weak evidence of a season-of-birth bias.
CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to viral infection could be a risk factor for developing AN.

21283063,Vaccine-induced allo-HLA-reactive memory T cells in a kidney transplantation candidate.,"BACKGROUND: Allo-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) reactivity by naturally acquired viral-specific memory T cells is common. However, the effect of successful vaccination on the alloreactive memory T-cell repertoire is unclear. We hypothesized that vaccination could specifically induce allo-HLA-reactive memory T cells.
METHODS: A varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immediate early 62 (IE62)-specific CD8 memory T-cell clone was single cell sorted from a VZV seronegative renal transplant candidate after response to live attenuated varicella vaccination. To analyze the allo-HLA reactivity, the VZV IE62-specific T-cell clone was tested against HLA-typed target cells and target cells transfected with HLA molecules, in both cytokine production and cytotoxicity assays.
RESULTS: The varicella vaccine-induced VZV IE62-specific T-cell clone specifically produced interferon-γ when stimulated with HLA-B*55:01-expressing Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells and HLA-B*55:01-transfected K562 cells (single HLA antigen expressing cell line [SALs]) only. The clone also demonstrated specific cytolytic effector function against HLA-B*55:01 SALs and phytohemagglutinin blasts. Cytotoxicity assays using proximal tubular epithelial cell and human umbilical vein endothelial cell targets confirmed the kidney tissue specificity of the allo-HLA-B*55:01 reactivity, and the relevance of the cross-reactivity to clinical kidney transplantation. The results also suggest that molecular mimicry, and not bystander proliferation, is the mechanism underlying vaccine-induced alloreactivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella vaccination generated a de novo alloreactive kidney cell-specific cytolytic effector memory T cell in a patient awaiting renal transplantation. Vaccination-induced alloreactivity may have important clinical implications, especially for vaccine timing and recipient monitoring.","[""D'Orsogna LJ"", 'van Besouw NM', 'van der Meer-Prins EM', 'van der Pol P', 'Franke-van Dijk M', 'Zoet YM', 'van der Slik A', 'Weimar W', 'van Kooten C', 'Mulder A', 'Roelen DL', 'Doxiadis II', 'Claas FH']",2011,91,6,Transplantation,"D'Orsogna LJ, et al.

METHOD: Data from 300 parents were gathered via a survey completed by the parents during their policlinic visit between January 2009 and March 2010 in Kocaeli, Turkey. The survey content was based on 10 Health Belief Model, each question being based on a 5-point Likert scale together with additional 19 questions in order to discover other demographic factors.
RESULTS: One of the differences in our study when compared to other published studies is mothers' jobs as employed mothers were significantly willing to have their children vaccinated whereas studies elsewhere have generally shown that demographic background variables do not affect parents' perceptions. The parents who took part in this study were not overly concerned about the side effects in contrast to other published studies. Another major finding is the positive influence of parents being informed by a consultant paediatrician rather than their family general practitioner.

21277405,Modelling the impact of a combined varicella and zoster vaccination programme on the epidemiology of varicella zoster virus in England.,"This study updates previous work on modelling the incidence of varicella and Herpes Zoster (HZ) following the introduction of childhood vaccination. The updated model includes new data on age-specific contact patterns, as well as data on the efficacy of zoster vaccination in the elderly and allows for HZ among vaccinees. The current study also looks at two-dose varicella childhood programmes, and assesses the combined impact of varicella vaccination in childhood and zoster vaccination of the elderly. The results suggest that a two-dose schedule is likely to reduce the incidence of varicella to very low levels, provided first dose coverage is around 90% and second dose coverage is in excess of 70%. Single dose varicella vaccination programmes are expected to result in large numbers of breakthrough cases. Childhood vaccination is expected to increase the incidence of zoster for more than 40 years after introduction of the programme, the magnitude of this increase being influenced primarily by the duration of boosting following exposure to the varicella zoster virus. Though this increase in zoster incidence can be partly offset by vaccination of the elderly, the effectiveness of this combined strategy is limited, as much of the increase occurs in those adults too young to be vaccinated. Childhood vaccination at intermediate levels of coverage (70% and 60% for first and second dose coverage respectively) is expected to lead to an increase in adult varicella. At high coverage (90% and 80% coverage) this is unlikely to be the case. These results will be used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis of combined varicella and zoster vaccination programmes.","['van Hoek AJ', 'Melegaro A', 'Zagheni E', 'Edmunds WJ', 'Gay N']",2011,29,13,Vaccine,"van Hoek AJ, et al.

21266337,"Probiotics and the immunological response to infant vaccinations: a prospective, placebo controlled pilot study.","BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been shown to be immunomodulatory and can affect antibody responses following vaccination. Several immunisations are associated with suboptimal seroconversion rates leaving a substantial part of the population exposed to infection.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of probiotic supplementation on the immune response of infants following mumps, measles, rubella and varicella vaccination.
METHODS: A randomised, placebo-controlled, double blinded prospective trial was performed in a cohort of healthy infants. Study subjects were randomly assigned to receive probiotics or placebo for a total of 5 months, starting 2 months prior to vaccination. Antibody levels against vaccine components were measured 3 months after immunisation. Treatment-related and vaccine-related adverse events were recorded.
FINDINGS: 47 infants completed the study, 25 in the probiotic group and 22 in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of infants failing to reach protective antibody titres against the different vaccine components (three infants in the placebo group against one in the treatment group for rubella, two each for mumps, four children vs two for measles). When combining all results in both groups, a larger percentage of failures to seroconvert occurred in the placebo group (17% vs 8%, p=0.052), a result of borderline significance. The number of infants needed to treat in order to prevent one failed vaccine component was 12. There was no difference in the rate of treatment related adverse effects between the two groups. There was a significant trend toward fewer vaccine related adverse effects in the treatment group.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral probiotics given to infants during the period of immunisation do not interfere with the immune response to mumps, measles, rubella and varicella vaccine, and may improve seroconversion rates.","['Youngster I', 'Kozer E', 'Lazarovitch Z', 'Broide E', 'Goldman M']",2011,96,4,Arch Dis Child,"Youngster I, et al.

The incidence of HZ infection at the first year after HSCT was 17/125 (13·6%). The cumulative incidence of HZ infection was 22/125 (17·6%). Sixteen (73%) cases with HZ and 11 (32%) cases in the control group had a diagnosis of malignant disorder. No significant difference was noted between the HZ group and the control group in absolute lymphocyte number and subsets (except WBC) at the pre-transplant evaluation. Pre-transplant WBC count was statistically lower in the HZ group (P<0·05). The CD4/CD8 ratios were lower in the HZ group during the first 6 months after HSCT, and the decrease was statistically significant at 6 months compared to the control group. In conclusion, patients undergoing HSCT for a malignant disorder had a significantly higher risk of VZV infection than those with non-malignant disorders and pretransplant donor characteristics were not helpful in predicting risk of post-transplant VZV infection.","['Aytaç S', 'Yalçin SS', 'Küçükbayrak O', 'Çetın M', 'Uçkan D']",2011,139,11,Epidemiol Infect,"Aytaç S, et al.

Baseline incidence of HZ prior to introduction of HZ vaccine is not well described, and it is unclear whether introduction of the varicella vaccination program in 1995 has altered the epidemiology of HZ. We examined trends in the incidence of HZ and impact of varicella vaccination on HZ trends using a large medical claims database.
METHODS: medical claims data from the MarketScan databases were obtained for 1993-2006. We calculated HZ incidence using all persons with a first outpatient service associated with a 053.xx code (HZ ICD-9 code) as the numerator, and total MarketScan enrollment as the denominator; HZ incidence was stratified by age and sex. We used statewide varicella vaccination coverage in children aged 19-35 months to explore the impact of varicella vaccination on HZ incidence.
RESULTS: HZ incidence increased for the entire study period and for all age groups, with greater rates of increase 1993-1996 (P < .001). HZ rates were higher for females than males throughout the study period (P < .001) and for all age groups (P < .001). HZ incidence did not vary by state varicella vaccination coverage.

21210614,Hip pain as initial presentation for varicella-zoster infection in an adolescent male.,"Hip pain and varicella infections are common diagnoses affecting children and adolescents. Hip pain in childhood can be a challenging presenting complaint for the pediatrician or orthopedic physician. The differential diagnosis is broad, and ranges from benign conditions, such as transient synovitis and muscle strains, to more serious infections or malignancies. Acute hip pain is usually referred to an orthopedic surgeon, and the principal concern is to distinguish infection of the hip joint or pelvis from an irritable hip or musculoskeletal pain. The Varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpes virus family, often presents as a generalized, pruritic, vesicular rash. The primary infection is commonly known as chickenpox. The prevalence of varicella infections has decreased significantly over the past decade with use of the varicella vaccine. Reactivation of varicella infection, or herpes zoster, in patients younger than 20 years is seen in only 68 per 100,000 people. Hip pain as the presenting symptom for onset of a herpes zoster infection is rare. This article presents a case of herpes zoster infection with initial presentation of hip pain in a 13-year-old boy. This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing atraumatic joint pain in the pediatric population.

METHODS: We assessed the effectiveness of 2 doses of varicella vaccine in a case-control study by identifying children ≥4 years of age with varicella confirmed by polymerase chain reaction assay and up to 2 controls matched by age and pediatric practice. Effectiveness was calculated using exact conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: From July 2006 to January 2010, of the 71 case subjects and 140 matched controls enrolled, no cases (0%) vs 22 controls (15.7%) had received 2 doses of varicella vaccine, 66 cases (93.0%) vs 117 controls (83.6%) had received 1 dose, and 5 cases (7.0%) vs 1 control (0.7%) did not receive varicella vaccine (P < .001). The effectiveness of 2 doses of the vaccine was 98.3% (95% confidence level [CI]: 83.5%-100%; P < .001). The matched odds ratio for 2 doses vs 1 dose of the vaccine was 0.053 (95% CI: 0.002-0.320; P < .001).
CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of 2 doses of varicella vaccine in the first 2.5 years after recommendation of a routine second dose of the vaccine for children is excellent.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey and Nationwide Inpatient Sample were analyzed to describe trends in varicella-related hospitalizations during the 1-dose vaccination era (2000-2006) compared with those in the prevaccination era (1988-1995). Varicella-related hospitalizations were defined by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Results were extrapolated to represent national estimates.
RESULTS: Using National Hospital Discharge Survey data, 24,488 varicella-related hospitalizations were estimated to occur in the United States during the 1-dose vaccination era. The varicella-related hospitalization rate was 0.12 per 10,000 population during the 1-dose vaccination era versus 0.42 per 10,000 population in the prevaccination era (P < .01). During the 1-dose vaccination era, the estimated annual average number of varicella-related hospitalizations was significantly lower and decreased by ≥ 65% in all age groups compared with those in the prevaccination era (P < .001 in all age groups). The varicella-related hospitalization rate during the 1-dose vaccination era estimated from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was 0.09 per 10,000 population.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella-related hospitalization numbers and rates declined significantly during the 1-dose varicella vaccination era. Assuming declines in varicella-related hospitalizations are due, mainly, to the routine childhood varicella vaccination program, these data suggest that varicella vaccination prevented ∼ 50,000 varicella-related hospitalizations in the United States from 2000 to 2006.","['Lopez AS', 'Zhang J', 'Brown C', 'Bialek S']",2011,127,2,Pediatrics,"Lopez AS, et al.

Post immunisation, healthcare workers in the UK who work with high risk patients are tested for seroconversion. To assess the performance of the time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA) for the detection of antibody in vaccinated as well as unvaccinated individuals, a cut-off was first calculated. VZV-IgG specific avidity and titres six weeks after the first dose of vaccine were used to identify subjects with pre-existing immunity among a cohort of 110 healthcare workers. Those with high avidity (≥ 60%) were considered to have previous immunity to VZV and those with low or equivocal avidity (<60%) were considered naive. The former had antibody levels ≥ 400 mIU/mL and latter had levels < 400 mIU/mL. Comparison of the baseline values of the naive and immune groups allowed the estimation of a TRFIA cut-off value of > 130 mIU/mL which best discriminated between the two groups and this was confirmed by ROC analysis. Using this value, the sensitivity and specificity of TRFIA cut-off were 90% (95% CI 79-96), and 78% (95% CI 61-90) respectively in this population. A subset of samples tested by the gold standard Fluorescence Antibody to Membrane Antigen (FAMA) test showed 84% (54/64) agreement with TRFIA.","['McDonald SL', 'Maple PA', 'Andrews N', 'Brown KE', 'Ayres KL', 'Scott FT', 'Al Bassam M', 'Gershon AA', 'Steinberg SP', 'Breuer J']",2011,172,01월 02일,J Virol Methods,"McDonald SL, et al.

22544501,Varicella at sea: a two-year study on cruise ships.,"BACKGROUND: Being highly contagious by person-to-person transmission, varicella can easily spread within the multinational population of a cruise ship and into communities ashore. The aim of the study was to report the prevalence of varicella infections in a fleet of cruise ships during a two-year period and to discuss measures to prevent and contain shipboard outbreaks.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All probable varicella cases among passengers and crew on 34 cruise ships were registered for 2 years by the medical facilities onboard. Patients remained isolated until 6 days after rash onset. Susceptible contacts were identified and offered post-exposure prophylaxis. Crew nationality, number of vaccinated contacts, and direct vaccination costs were registered.
RESULTS: During two years 187 varicella cases (36 passengers, 151 crew) were registered and 2,685 varicella vaccinations were administered at an estimated direct vaccination cost of US $ 283,832. Of the 34 ships, only 3 reported no cases of varicella. There were 8 clusters ('outbreaks') of ≥ 5 varicella cases presenting less than 42 days apart, comprising a total of 89 patients. While > 130 nations were represented among the crew, the 151 crew cases came from 26 countries, and 88 (58%) of them came from 5 sub-tropical/tropical countries.
CONCLUSIONS: All cruise vessels must expect to encounter varicella cases or outbreaks onboard every few years. Every varicella case can start an outbreak and thus trigger several time-consuming and expensive containment measures, including isolation and mass vaccination of susceptible contacts. Mandatory pre-contract evidence of varicella immunity from all seafarers or from subgroups according to position or nationality might be worth considering.

21185851,The changing epidemiology of varicella incidence after implementation of the one-dose varicella vaccination policy.,"The varicella vaccine has been available in the Taiwan market since July 1997. Beginning 1998-1999, Taipei City and Taichung City/County as the early launch areas included the varicella vaccine in their free pediatric vaccination programs. By contrast, the national free vaccination program was not implemented until 2004. We aim to investigate the changing epidemiology of varicella incidence through an analysis of age-period-cohort effects. With the greatest decrease in varicella incidence occurring in children aged below 6, the incidence of varicella shifted to older age groups as reflected in different birth cohorts. The current study provides important implications for the current vaccination policy.","['Lian IeB', 'Chien YZ', 'Hsu PS', 'Chao DY']",2011,29,7,Vaccine,"Lian IeB, et al.

21185366,"'Every mother is a mini-doctor': ethnomedicinal uses of fish, shellfish and some other aquatic animals in Bangladesh.","AIM OF THE STUDY: This research article examines the zootherapeutic uses of fish, shellfish and some other aquatic animals in two fishing villages in Bangladesh-one floodplain and one coastal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The floodplain fishing village Volarkandi is located within the Hakaluki wetland ecosystem in the northern Bangladesh and is inhabited mostly by Muslim fishers, whereas the coastal fishing village Thakurtala is located on Moheskhali island and most of the inhabitants are caste-based Hindu fishers. Participatory techniques were used to collect and validate information from the key informants.
RESULTS: The research revealed that, historically, fishers have used fish and other aquatic animals not only as food items for nutrition, but also to solve a host of physical problems and diseases. Fish and shellfish are widely used for their galactogogue and aphrodisiac properties, for quick recovery from long-time sickness, to enhance the 'intelligence level' of children, and to prevent and treat a host of diseases like night blindness, chicken pox, dysentery, piles, muscular inflammation, fistula, malaria, skin diseases and 'big belly' syndrome in children. Depending on the objective of the use, different parts of the animal body, its derivatives, or the whole animal are used. The research also clarified different forms of the recipes used. The socio-cultural construction of the ethnomedicinal uses and the distinct gender roles of the fisherwomen were analyzed.
CONCLUSION: The research revealed that the aetiologies and the preventive measures against folk illness are socio-culturally embedded and such indigenous medical systems grow and are sustained as a situated body of knowledge within the boundaries of a typical world view framed by local culture and biodiversity.","['Deb AK', 'Emdad Haque C']",2011,134,2,J Ethnopharmacol,"Deb AK and Emdad Haque C.

21177308,"Varicella zoster disease of the central nervous system: epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory features 10 years after the introduction of the varicella vaccine.","BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of live attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine in 1995 there has been a significant reduction in varicella incidence and its associated complications, but the impact on VZV-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease has not been assessed.
METHODS: In this descriptive study we evaluated patients referred to the California Encephalitis Project from 1998 to 2009 with VZV PCR-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were collected using a standardized case form. Specimens were genotyped using multi-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-six specimens were genotyped from patients 12-85 years of age (median, 46 years). Clinical presentations included meningitis (50%), encephalitis (42%), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (8%). Only 11 patients (42%) had a concomitant herpes zoster rash. Genotype analysis identified 20 European Group (Clade1, Clade 3) strains; 4 Asian (Clade 2) strains, and 2 Mosaic Group (Clade 4, Clade VI) strains. One specimen was recognized as vaccine strain by identifying vaccine-associated SNPs.
CONCLUSIONS: VZV continues to be associated with CNS disease, with meningitis being the most frequent clinical presentation. CNS VZV disease often presented without accompanying zoster rash. Sequencing data revealed multiple genotypes, including 1 vaccine strain detected in the CSF of a young patient with meningitis.","['Pahud BA', 'Glaser CA', 'Dekker CL', 'Arvin AM', 'Schmid DS']",2011,203,3,J Infect Dis,"Pahud BA, et al.

We report an endemic outbreak of varicella among 4 Indian students in Magdeburg in November and December 2008. An initially severe course was observed in three of these patients with a negative vaccination status. Large vesicular skin lesions with a diameter of up to 8 mm were found in all patients. Molecular genetic tests revealed African/Indian clade 5 in 2 patients, although the European clades (i.e., clade 1 and 3) are the most common in Germany, accounting for 85 %. All patients recovered without any complications after administration of intravenous aciclovir at a dosage of 10 mg per kg body weight. Although isolated cases of varicella are not notifiable according to the German Protection against Infection Act, endemic outbreaks must be reported to the appropriate health surveillance authorities.","['Kolesnik M', 'Sauerbrei A', 'Franke I', 'König W', 'Gollnick H', 'Bonnekoh B']",2011,9,6,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Kolesnik M, et al.

21159706,Varicella and stroke in children: good outcome without steroids.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the only human virus known to replicate in arteries. After the acute infection, the virus persists in a noninfectious latent form in ganglia along the neuraxis, with intermittent periods of reactivation. Both primary and secondary reactivation are associated with stroke in children. These patients, regardless of the chosen treatment, have a high risk of recurrence, particularly those with worsening arterial stenosis. There are no specific therapy protocols for varicella-associated stroke in children, and the use of steroids or antiviral drugs is still controversial. We present a series of 4 children with stroke following varicella infection, with no recurrence and stable vascular stenosis at a mean follow-up of 18 months without steroid treatment. We also analyze possible correlations between anti-protein C, protein S and protein Z autoantibodies, and post-varicella arteriopathy.","['Bartolini L', 'Gentilomo C', 'Sartori S', 'Calderone M', 'Simioni P', 'Laverda AM']",2011,17,6,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,"Bartolini L, et al.

This ecological approach allows the assessment of vaccine effectiveness under field conditions by relating vaccine coverage in cohorts of 24-month-old children to the mean number of cases per reporting unit in the sentinel network. For the 1-2 years age group, which is directly affected by the vaccination programme, a one-dose vaccine effectiveness of 83·2% (95% CI 80·2-85·7) was estimated which corresponds to previous approaches assessing varicella vaccine effectiveness in the field in the USA.","['Höhle M', 'Siedler A', 'Bader HM', 'Ludwig M', 'Heininger U', 'Von Kries R']",2011,139,11,Epidemiol Infect,"Höhle M, et al.

21152004,Little Italy: an agent-based approach to the estimation of contact patterns- fitting predicted matrices to serological data.,"Knowledge of social contact patterns still represents the most critical step for understanding the spread of directly transmitted infections. Data on social contact patterns are, however, expensive to obtain. A major issue is then whether the simulation of synthetic societies might be helpful to reliably reconstruct such data. In this paper, we compute a variety of synthetic age-specific contact matrices through simulation of a simple individual-based model (IBM). The model is informed by Italian Time Use data and routine socio-demographic data (e.g., school and workplace attendance, household structure, etc.). The model is named ""Little Italy"" because each artificial agent is a clone of a real person. In other words, each agent's daily diary is the one observed in a corresponding real individual sampled in the Italian Time Use Survey. We also generated contact matrices from the socio-demographic model underlying the Italian IBM for pandemic prediction. These synthetic matrices are then validated against recently collected Italian serological data for Varicella (VZV) and ParvoVirus (B19). Their performance in fitting sero-profiles are compared with other matrices available for Italy, such as the Polymod matrix. Synthetic matrices show the same qualitative features of the ones estimated from sample surveys: for example, strong assortativeness and the presence of super- and sub-diagonal stripes related to contacts between parents and children. Once validated against serological data, Little Italy matrices fit worse than the Polymod one for VZV, but better than concurrent matrices for B19. This is the first occasion where synthetic contact matrices are systematically compared with real ones, and validated against epidemiological data. The results suggest that simple, carefully designed, synthetic matrices can provide a fruitful complementary approach to questionnaire-based matrices. The paper also supports the idea that, depending on the transmissibility level of the infection, either the number of different contacts, or repeated exposure, may be the key factor for transmission.","['Iozzi F', 'Trusiano F', 'Chinazzi M', 'Billari FC', 'Zagheni E', 'Merler S', 'Ajelli M', 'Del Fava E', 'Manfredi P']",2010,6,12,PLoS Comput Biol,"Iozzi F, et al.

21149253,Risk factors for oligodendroglial tumors: a pooled international study.,"Oligodendroglial tumors are rare subtypes of brain tumors and are often combined with other glial tumors in epidemiological analyses. However, different demographic associations and clinical characteristics suggest potentially different risk factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate possible risk factors for oligodendroglial tumors (including oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and mixed glioma). Data from 7 case-control studies (5 US and 2 Scandinavian) were pooled. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for age group, gender, and study site. Data on 617 cases and 1260 controls were available for analyses. Using data from all 7 studies, history of allergies and/or asthma was associated with a decreased risk of anaplastic oligodendroglioma (OR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.9), and history of asthma only was associated with a decreased risk of oligodendroglioma (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1-0.9). A family history of brain tumors was associated with an increased risk of anaplastic oligodendroglioma (OR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.5). Having had chicken pox was associated with a decreased risk of oligodendroglioma (OR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.9) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) in the US studies. Although there is some overlap in risk factors between oligodendroglial tumors and gliomas as a group, it is likely that additional factors specific to oligodendroglial tumors have yet to be identified. Large, multi-institution international studies will be necessary to better characterize these etiological risk factors.","['McCarthy BJ', 'Rankin KM', 'Aldape K', 'Bondy ML', 'Brännström T', 'Broholm H', 'Feychting M', ""Il'yasova D"", 'Inskip PD', 'Johansen C', 'Melin BS', 'Ruder AM', 'Butler MA', 'Scheurer ME', 'Schüz J', 'Schwartzbaum JA', 'Wrensch MR', 'Davis FG']",2011,13,2,Neuro Oncol,"McCarthy BJ, et al.

21144586,Facial herpes zoster complicated by varicella zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis: The diagnostic significance of atypical lymphocytes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).,"BACKGROUND: In general, viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) manifest as encephalitis and, less commonly, as meningoencephalitis or aseptic meningitis. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is an uncommon cause of encephalitis.
METHODS: Herpes zoster (shingles) is a cutaneous reactivation of previous chickenpox infection due to VZV. Herpes zoster may be dermatomal (ie, <3 dermatomes) or disseminated (ie, >3 dermatomes). Decreased cell-mediated immunity from stress, steroids, or immunosuppressive drugs often precede dermatomal/disseminated herpes zoster. With herpes zoster, the closer the dermatomal involvement is to the CNS (ie, head/neck shingles), the more likely a patient will have symptomatic CNS involvement (eg, encephalitis). Except for the association of the herpes zoster rash and the simultaneous/subsequent encephalitis, there are few clinical features that distinguish VZV encephalitis from that due to other viruses. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile of VZV encephalitis is usually clinically indistinguishable from that due to of other causes of viral encephalitis. In VZV meningoencephalitis or encephalitis, the CSF typically shows a modest lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal CSF glucose levels, variably elevated CSF protein levels, and normal CSF lactic acid levels. Atypical lymphocytes are rare in the CSF with VZV encephalitis.
RESULTS: We present the case of a 75-year-old woman who developed VZV encephalitis after having herpes zoster on her forehead. Except for facial herpes zoster, there were no clinically distinguishing features to determine the cause of her encephalitis. Her CSF had 800 white blood cells/high power field with 26% lymphocytes (17% atypical lymphocytes). The patient's CSF glucose and CSF lactate dehydrogenase levels were normal, and her CSF protein was elevated. The CSF lactic acid was minimally elevated secondary to red blood cells in the CSF. Electroencephalogram showed general background slowing bilaterally, typical of viral encephalitis. The absence of unilateral focal frontotemporal/parietal lobe focus on electroencephalogram argued against the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis. CSF atypical lymphocytes provided the key clue to the etiology of her encephalitis. CSF atypical lymphocytes are not uncommon in Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus encephalitis. Less commonly, atypical lymphocytes may be present in the CSF with enteroviruses, West Nile encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis. VZV is a rare cause of atypical lymphocytes in the CSF but was the clue to the diagnosis before CSF polymerase chain reaction results for VZV were available. Her CSF polymerase chain reaction was negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus-6, cytomegalovirus, enteroviruses, and West Nile virus, but was positive for VZV. She made an uneventful recovery with acyclovir.
CONCLUSION: CSF atypical lymphocytes, if present, are an important diagnostic clue in some causes of viral encephalitis. The most common cause of nonseasonal viral encephalitis is herpes simplex virus, which is not associated with CSF atypical lymphocytes. Patients with Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, West Nile encephalitis, and enteroviruses usually have extra-CNS signs and symptoms which should suggest the cause of the patient's encephalitis. CSF atypical lymphocytes limit the differential diagnostic possibilities in patients with viral encephalitis and may be the key clue to the diagnosis, as in the case presented.","['Cunha BA', 'Strollo S', 'Durie N', 'Ibrahim MS']",2011,40,2,Heart Lung,"Cunha BA, et al.

Typical CVS stigmata are cerebral abnormalities, eye diseases and segmentally distributed, cicatricial skin lesions. In this paper the authors report on a male preterm infant, born at 30 weeks of gestation, who developed pustular skin lesions at the age of 4 weeks. The mother had suffered from chickenpox at 14 weeks of gestation. Apart from skin manifestations, critical bronchopulmonary dysplasia made the infant conspicuous. The VZV genome was detected in blood, respiratory secretions and skin lesions. At age 10 weeks he presented with extensive intestinal wall perforation, considered to be related to CVS, which finally led to death. This case shows for the first time the clinical course of CVS in a preterm infant. It illustrates the need for discussion of comprehensive VZV vaccination for seronegative women of childbearing age.","['Neubauer V', 'Griesmaier E', 'Trawoger R', 'Kiechl-Kohlendorfer U']",2011,96,4,Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,"Neubauer V, et al.

21121231,"Varicella seroprevalence in the U.S.: data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004.","OBJECTIVE: We estimated the varicella seroprevalence among the U.S. population aged 6-49 years based on retested National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) specimens collected between 1999 and 2004--originally tested using a method unsuitable for detecting vaccine-induced immunity--and compared it with historical estimates.
METHODS: We performed a confirmatory test suitable for detecting vaccine-induced immunity on all available specimens from 6- to 19-year-olds who originally tested negative (n = 633), and on 297 randomly selected specimens that had tested positive. Retest results superseded original results for determining seroprevalence. We assessed seroprevalence for the entire sample aged 6-49 years (n = 16,050) by participant demographic characteristics and compared it with historical estimates (NHANES 1988-1994).
RESULTS: The percentage of false-negative results for the original test was higher for specimens from younger children (6-11 years of age: 27.5%; 12-19 years of age: 13.3%) and for specimens collected most recently (2001-2004: 26.0%; 1999-2000: 12.6%). The age-adjusted rate of varicella seroprevalence for 1999-2004 was 93.6% for 6- to 19-year-olds and 98.0% for adults aged 20-49 years compared with 90.0% and 98.1%, respectively, for 1988-1994. We found an increase in seropositivity between the survey periods, from 93.2% to 97.2% (p < 0.001) among 12- to 19-year-olds. For children, non-Hispanic black ethnicity and younger age were associated with lower seroprevalence in both survey periods.
CONCLUSIONS: Varicella seroprevalence increased with age among children and was uniformly high in the U.S. adult population between 1999 and 2004.

Post-herpetic neuralgia is described as sharp, burning, aching, or shooting constantly present in the dermatome that corresponds with the earlier rash. The objectives of treating herpes zoster are: (1) acute pain reduction; (2) promotion of recovery of epidermal defects and prevention of secondary infections; and (3) reduction or prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia. The objective of the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia is primarily pain alleviation and improvement of the quality of life. Early treatment of the infection and the pain is believed to reduce the risk for post-herpetic neuralgia. This persistent pain syndrome is difficult to treat. Antiepileptic drugs and tricyclic antidepressants are the first choice. Interventional treatments, such as epidural injections of corticosteroids and local anesthetic drugs, have an effect on the acute pain but are of limited use in preventing post-herpetic neuralgia. When conservative treatment fails in providing satisfactory relief of post-herpetic neuralgia, a sympathetic block may be considered (2 C+); if this treatment provides unsatisfactory results, spinal cord stimulation may be considered, in a study context (2 C+).","['van Wijck AJ', 'Wallace M', 'Mekhail N', 'van Kleef M']",2011,11,1,Pain Pract,"van Wijck AJ, et al.

Varicella zoster virus can be latent in cranial nerve or dorsal root ganglia, and reactivate several decades later to produce vesicles with post-herpetic neuralgia. HZ myelitis usually occurs in elderly or immunocompromised patients. We report here a case of HZ myelitis of the cervical spinal cord in a 35-year-old woman who was immunocompetent. Cervical myelitis developed 1 month after the eruption of vesicles. Pure sensation loss was limited initially from the C2 to T1 dermatomes, but later progressed to lower limb sensory loss and sphincter function impairment. The patient's motor function was also mildly affected. Despite the initial rapid neurological deterioration, the symptoms dramatically improved after 5 days of parenteral acyclovir and steroid administration with rehabilitation. We therefore propose that early medical intervention is necessary for better and earlier recovery.","['Lee CC', 'Wu JC', 'Huang WC', 'Shih YH', 'Cheng H']",2010,73,11,J Chin Med Assoc,"Lee CC, et al.

21080022,How frequent is varicella-associated pneumonia in children?,"Varicella is a frequent though mild infection in children, but it can cause important morbidity in adults. The most frequent complication in adults is varicella pneumonia. However, lower airway complications associated to varicella have been scarcely studied in children. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of the children hospitalized for varicella-associated pneumonia in the three public hospitals on the Island of Mallorca. We discovered that 17/213 (8%) children hospitalized for varicella were diagnosed of pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization for varicella complication due to pneumonia was 4.3 cases per 10,000 varicella infections. Only one patient was diagnosed of varicella pneumonia, which accounts for 0.3 cases per 10,000 varicella infections. Nine of 17 (53%) cases were classified as bacterial pneumonia. Statistical differences (p < 0.05) in the median time from rash (5.9 vs. 2.4 days) and fever (4.1 vs. 2.2 days) to admission were observed between bacterial and viral pneumonia. However, outcome differences measured by the median length of stay, need for oxygen, and admission to the intensive care unit were not observed. Varicella pneumonia is a very rare complication of varicella in children. Most of the lower airway infections in the course of varicella are associated to other co-infections.","['Hervás D', 'Henales V', 'Yeste S', 'Figuerola J', 'Hervás J']",2011,30,3,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Hervás D, et al.

VZV infections cause various clinical scenarios depending on the maternal immune status and the time of infection. Herpes zoster usually poses no risk to the pregnant woman and there is no need for antiviral therapy. VZV infection of a seronegative mother, however, may lead to severe varicella in the pregnant woman and to congenital malformations (congenital varicella syndrome) in case of early infection or neonatal varicella in case of perinatal infection. Prompt therapy with acyclovir or administration of VZV immunoglobulin for prophylaxis is mandatory in those patients. In case of Lyme borreliosis of the mother, adequate antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin prevents harm to the fetus. Doxycycline is contraindicated during pregnancy. Scabies represents an important differential diagnosis of pruritic dermatoses in pregnancy and should be treated with permethrin 5% cream.","['Müllegger RR', 'Glatz M']",2010,61,12,Hautarzt,Müllegger RR and Glatz M.

In this prospective study, comprehensive data on the current distribution of VZV clades in Germany were collected. VZV strains from 213 patients with varicella and 109 with zoster were genotyped using the scattered single-nucleotide polymorphism method on the basis of sequencing open reading frames 1, 21, 22, 37, 50, 54 and 60. In varicella, clade 3 was detected in 45.5%, clade 1 in 30.0%, clade 5 in 21.1% and clade 2 in 0.9% of the cases. The analysis of zoster strains revealed clade 3 in 50.5%, clade 1 in 46.8%, clade 2 and clade 4 in 0.9% of the cases each. Five strains from varicella and one strain from zoster could not be attributed to any of the major and provisional VZV clades. Statistical analysis verified significantly lower frequency of clade 1 and significantly higher frequency of clade 5 in patients with varicella compared to zoster. In addition, varicella patients with clade 5 strains were significantly younger than the patients with clade 3. In conclusion, almost one half of VZV infections in Germany were caused currently by VZV clade 3. In primary VZV infection, nearly 20% of clade 1 has been replaced by clade 5 that might spread more effectively in the population than the European VZV clades.","['Sauerbrei A', 'Stefanski J', 'Philipps A', 'Krumbholz A', 'Zell R', 'Wutzler P']",2011,200,2,Med Microbiol Immunol,"Sauerbrei A, et al.

International literature and European legislation recommend preventive interventions to minimize the risk.
METHODS: A literature review and a seroprevalence study were carried out in 9 hospitals located in north and central Italy, in order to evaluate risk assessment, health surveillance and fitness for work of HCW exposed to V, R, Mu and Me. Antibodies (Ab) against V, R, Mu and Me were determined. For a subgroup of 4 hospitals; sociodemographic, occupational data and sera were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: About 36000 tests on about 9000 HCW were analyzed. Differences in seroprevalence ratios (V 85.7-95.1%, R 47-96.8%, Me 71.4-97.8%, Mu 52.5-87.6%) were detected. In a subgroup, a relevant number of non immune HCW was also found among women infertile age and areas at higher risk. Statistically significant differences were detected only for selected variables and viruses.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Data of multicenter study confirm literature evidences and allow to define good medical practices for manage and minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission of V, R, Me and Mu. Recommendation are issued about serologic screening on HCW exposed to all 4 viruses thorough the modern analytical techniques, in order to assess risk on individual a group basis and to select priorities for intervention. Vaccination should be prescribed for those HCW non immune, selecting areas and HCW according to priorities.","['Campagna M', 'Bacis M', 'Belotti L', 'Biggi N', 'Carrer P', 'Cologni L', 'Gattinis V', 'Lodi V', 'Magnavita N', 'Micheloni G', 'Negro C', 'Oppini M', 'Placidi D', 'Polato R', 'Puro V', 'Tonelli E', 'Porru S']",2010,32,3,G Ital Med Lav Ergon,"Campagna M, et al.

Wild-type VZV DNA was detected from multiple samples from esophagus, liver and skin. Genotypic analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphism profiles in open reading frames (ORFs) 21, 22 and 50 identified this strain as a clade 4 isolate, which is typically found in tropical countries.

Serum samples were obtained at each institution from consenting patients during April-August, 2008. Anti-VZV IgG antibody was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. Of the 887 patients, 87.6% had anti-VZV IgG antibody. The prevalence of anti-VZV IgG antibody was 75% during the first 3 months after birth, but was only 13.6% 12 months after birth. Anti-VZV IgG antibody prevalence increased, first at 1-2 years of age, and then at 5-6 years of age. The seroprevalence rate exceeded 90% in subjects over 11 years of age. The results show that the seroprevalence of VZV is relatively high in the South Korean population.

20975615,The immunogenicity and safety of live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.,"BACKGROUND: The live attenuated varicella vaccine is recommended for HIV-infected children who are not severely immunosuppressed. This study aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of varicella vaccination among HIV-infected children who had severe immunosuppression before receiving antiretroviral therapy.
METHODS: Sixty HIV-infected children with no history of chickenpox or herpes zoster infection with CD4 T lymphocyte counts ≥ 15% or ≥ 200 cell/mm were enrolled. Two doses of varicella vaccine were administered at the time of enrollment and at 3 months. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibody was tested at baseline and 3 months after each dose by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. An antibody titer >20 HU/mL was regarded as protective.
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) of age, CD4 nadir, and current CD4 percentage were 11.2 (8.5-12.8) years, 9.5% (3-14), and 28% (22-32), respectively. Fifty-seven children (95%) received antiretroviral therapy for a median of 27 months. Among 34 children (57%) who were VZV seronegative at baseline, 11.8% (95% CI, 3.3%-27.5%) and 79.4% (95% CI, 62.1%-91.3%) were VZV seroconverted after first and second dose of vaccine, respectively. Children who had VZV seroconversion were more likely to have HIV RNA <1.7 copies/mL (92.6% vs. 71.4%, P = 0.18). Among 26 children who were seropositive at baseline, the geometric mean titers were increased from 56.7 to 107.9 and 134.6 unit/mL, respectively. Local and systemic reactions of grade 1 and 2 were reported in 13% and 4% of children, respectively. There was a trend toward better response among children with younger age, high CD4, and viral suppression.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the 2 doses of varicella vaccine resulted in high seroconversion rates without serious adverse reactions. Varicella vaccination for HIV-infected children should be encouraged.","['Taweesith W', 'Puthanakit T', 'Kowitdamrong E', 'Bunupuradah T', 'Wongngam W', 'Phasomsap C', 'Apornpong T', 'Bouko C', 'Pancharoen C']",2011,30,4,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Taweesith W, et al.

20973377,A psychosocial approach to dentistry for the underserved: incorporating theory into practice.,"BACKGROUND: Dentistry for the underserved is more than an egalitarian social issue--it is a key factor in the health and social progress of our nation. The first signs or manifestations of several diseases such as varicella (i.e., chicken pox and shingles), STDs, and influenza become apparent in the oral cavity. The value of access to quality dentistry is an immeasurable factor in maintaining general medical health of people and fulfilling their psychosocial needs of pain reduction and enhanced cosmetics. In the United States, for the most part, only the middle and upper classes receive non-extraction, restorative, and prosthetic dentistry that is economically within their ability to pay. In addition, uninsured and poverty-level individuals often must face overwhelming long waiting lists, unnecessary referrals, lack of choice, and bureaucratic hurdles when seeking primary dental care. Therefore, it seems pertinent to put forth the question: What are the critical values and beliefs of psychosocial theory that can underscore the practice of dentistry for underserved populations in the United States?
METHODS: The widely employed public health theory, the health belief model (HBM), is applied to evaluate psychosocial factors in dental care for the underserved. The HBM is used to predict and explain behavioral changes in dental health and associated belief patterns.
RESULTS: The HBM as applied to dentistry for the underserved predicts self-perceptions of susceptibility and seriousness of dental disease, health status, cues to action, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, patients can make judgments about benefits, costs, and risks of dental treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: A theoretical approach to dentistry employing the HBM, mediated by values and culture, can provide significant insights into patient thinking, beliefs, and perceptions. These insights can mediate access to and use of primary care dental services by underserved populations.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Evidence-based practice (i.e., based on research using the scientific method) has been put forth as the future of modern dentistry. However, the practice of dentistry need not just be evidence-based, but have its roots clearly grounded in theory.","['Flaer PJ', 'Younis MZ', 'Benjamin PL', 'Al Hajeri M']",2010,37,1,J Health Care Finance,"Flaer PJ, et al.

A total of 30 fowl pox vaccine samples were examined for the presence of REV using both in vitro and in vivo methods. In in vitro testing, the fowl pox vaccine samples were inoculated into chicken embryo fibroblast cultures prepared from specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs, and the cultures were examined using PCR to detect REV. In in vivo testing, each fowl pox vaccine sample was inoculated into 5-d-old specific-pathogen-free chicks, which were kept under observation for up to 12 wk postinoculation; serum samples were collected at 15, 30, and 45 d postinoculation for the detection of REV-specific antibodies using ELISA. Tissue samples were collected at 8 and 12 wk postinoculation for histopathological examination. Of the tested vaccines, only one imported vaccine sample tested positive for REV using PCR. Serum samples collected from chicks infected with the PCR-positive vaccine batch also tested positive for REV-specific antibodies using ELISA. Histopathological examination of the liver, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius demonstrated the presence of tumor cells in these organs, confirming the results obtained using PCR and ELISA, and indicating that the sample was contaminated with REV. These data clearly indicate that the screening of all commercial poultry vaccines for viruses is an important factor in assuring the biosafety of animal vaccines.","['Awad AM', 'Abd El-Hamid HS', 'Abou Rawash AA', 'Ibrahim HH']",2010,89,11,Poult Sci,"Awad AM, et al.

20936505,Comparative sequence analysis of B5R gene of zoonotic buffalo pox virus isolates with other orthopoxviruses.,"The present paper describes the isolation of buffalo pox virus from scab lesions and its molecular characterization through B5R gene sequencing. During our study, pustular pox lesions were observed on the teats and mammary parenchyma of cattle and buffaloes, and the disease was of significant zoonotic importance since similar lesions were produced on the hands, legs, and face of people in close contact with the affected animals. The collected scab materials were subjected for virus isolation in 9-11-day-old chicken embryos by the chorioallontoic membrane route and in the Vero cell line. The virus was confirmed by a sensitive and rapid diagnostic polymerase chain reaction using the primers that amplify ""A type inclusion"" gene, and further, B5R gene of the virus was sequenced and compared with the corresponding sequences of other orthopoxviruses. The results showed high sequence homology of our isolates with other orthopoxviruses.","['Chandranaik BM', 'Singh RK', 'Hosamani M', 'Krishnappa G', 'Harish BR', 'Chethana CS', 'Renukaprasad C']",2011,43,2,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Chandranaik BM, et al.

20930562,Factors affecting Varicella vaccine uptake among children 1-17 years old in the Haifa District in 2007.,"The Israeli National Vaccination Program (INVP) is aimed mainly at the pediatric age group. Till 2008 the program did not include routine administration of vaccine against Varicella (chickenpox). For the past 7 years, however, vaccine against Varicella has been available to the public and subsidized through the health maintenance organizations (HMOs). On the eve of probable introduction of the Varicella Zoster Vaccine (VZ-V) into the INVP a study was conducted to examine factors postulated to be of importance in vaccination uptake. These factors can be assessed while the vaccine is only administered through active choice, as opposed to administration by default as part of INVP. The study group comprised the communities in the District of Haifa. The aim of the study was to assess vaccination rates and contributing factors in the decision to vaccinate or not vaccinate against VZ. The study showed that uptake of VZ-V was in correlation with: 1. Population group (i.e. religious denomination)--Jews were more likely to vaccinate (OR=3.88). 2. Level of education--parents with higher level of education were more likely to vaccinate. (OR=1.91). 3. Level of religious observance--non-observant parents were more likely to vaccinate (OR=2.7) 4. Complementary insurance (reimbursement of cost)--parents with complementary insurance were more likely to vaccinate (OR=3.41). 5. A physician's recommendation to vaccinate--when a physician recommendation was given for vaccination the likelihood of vaccination was increased (OR=2.94).","['Miron E', 'Abu-Foul N', 'Rishpon S']",2010,6,10,Hum Vaccin,"Miron E, et al.

20929354,A 2009 varicella outbreak in a Connecticut residential facility for adults with intellectual disability.,"We investigated a varicella outbreak in a residential facility for adults with intellectual disabilities. A case of varicella was defined as a generalized maculopapular rash that developed in a facility resident or employee. Immunoglobulin M testing was conducted on serologic samples, and polymerase chain reaction testing was performed on environmental and skin lesion samples. Eleven cases were identified among 70 residents and 2 among ∼145 staff. An unrecognized case of herpes zoster was the likely source. Case patients first entered any residential facility at a younger age than non-case residents (9.5 vs 15.0 years; P < .01). Varicella zoster virus DNA was detected 2 months after the outbreak in environmental samples obtained from case patients' residences. This outbreak exemplifies the potential for at-risk pockets of varicella-susceptible adults, especially among those who have lived in residential facilities from a young age. Evidence of immunity should be verified for all adults and healthcare staff in similar residential settings.","['Leung J', 'Kudish K', 'Wang C', 'Moore L', 'Gacek P', 'Radford K', 'Lopez A', 'Sosa L', 'Schmid DS', 'Cartter M', 'Bialek S']",2010,202,10,J Infect Dis,"Leung J, et al.

20925251,[Herpes zoster in the Czech Republic--epidemiology and clinical manifestations].,"Herpes zoster (shingles) is a viral infection of the skin that manifests itself as painful, unilateral vesicular rash. The causative agent is varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Primary infection with VZV causes chickenpox, a common childhood infection, and then the virus lies dormant in the sensory neural ganglia, reactivating to cause shingles. The most important complications are neurological disorders (in particular postherpetic neuralgia) and eye disorders. First-line therapy are antiviral agents. A single vaccine has been registered to date. Herpes zoster occurs sporadically in the Czech Republic and its incidence is long-term stable. In 1990-2008 the average annual incidence was 6306 cases (61.3 cases/100,000 population), with the lowest number of 5511 cases (53.5/100,000) reported in 1991 and the highest number of 6,894 cases (67.6/100,000) reported in 2002. The incidence rate in females (69.9/100,000) was 1.4 times as high as in males (49.5/100,000). From the age perspective, the elderly are at a considerably higher risk of developing shingles. In 2008, the incidence rate was the highest in the age group 70 years (155.0/100,000). Nevertheless, the beginning of the upward trend is seen in the age group 45-49 years. Herpes zoster does not show any seasonal trend.","['Smetana J', 'Salavec M', 'Bostíková V', 'Chlíbek R', 'Bostík P', 'Hanovcová I', 'Vacková M', 'Matulková P', 'Splino M']",2010,59,3,Epidemiol Mikrobiol Imunol,"Smetana J, et al.

20874010,Varicella-zoster virus human ganglionic latency: a current summary.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous human herpes virus typically acquired in childhood when it causes varicella (chickenpox), following which the virus establishes a latent infection in trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia that lasts for the life of the individual. VZV subsequently reactivates, spontaneously or after specific triggering factors, to cause herpes zoster (shingles), which may be complicated by postherpetic neuralgia and several other neurological complications including vasculopathy. Our understanding of VZV latency lags behind our knowledge of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latency primarily due to the difficulty in propagating the virus to high titers in a cell-free state, and the lack of a suitable small-animal model for studying virus latency and reactivation. It is now established beyond doubt that latent VZV is predominantly located in human ganglionic neurons. Virus gene transcription during latency is epigenetically regulated, and appears to be restricted to expression of at least six genes, with expression of gene 63 being the hallmark of latency. However, viral gene transcription may be more extensive than previously thought. There is also evidence for several VZV genes being expressed at the protein level, including VZV gene 63-encoded protein, but recent evidence suggests that this may not be a common event. The nature and extent of the chronic inflammatory response in latently infected ganglia is also of current interest. There remain several questions concerning the VZV latency process that still need to be resolved unambiguously and it is likely that this will require the use of newly developed molecular technologies, such as GeXPS multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for virus transcriptional analysis and ChIP-seq to study the epigenetic of latent virus genome ( Liu et al, 2010 , BMC Biol 8: 56).","['Kennedy PG', 'Cohrs RJ']",2010,16,6,J Neurovirol,Kennedy PG and Cohrs RJ.

Concerns have been raised that the virus might reactivate immediately after death. Because features of varicella-zoster virus latency are similar in primate and human ganglia, we examined virus gene expression in tissues either processed immediately or kept at 4°C for 30 h before necropsy of two monkeys inoculated with simian varicella-zoster virus and euthanized 117 days later. Virus transcription and the detection of open reading frame (ORF) 63 protein in the cytoplasm of neurons were comparable. Thus, a 30-h delay after death did not affect varicella-zoster virus expression in latently infected ganglia.","['Mahalingam R', 'Traina-Dorge V', 'Wellish M', 'Deharo E', 'Golive A', 'Messaoudi I', 'Gilden D']",2010,84,23,J Virol,"Mahalingam R, et al.

20848637,The controversy of varicella vaccination in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: The available guidelines for varicella vaccination of susceptible children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have become increasingly conservative. However, vaccination of those who have remained in continuous complete remission for 1 year and are receiving chemotherapy is still considered a reasonable option. There is little available data to allow a comparison of the risk versus benefit of vaccinating these patients.
PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed mortality due to varicella in the records of 15 pediatric ALL study groups throughout Europe, Asia, and North America during the period 1984-2008.
RESULTS: We found that 20 of 35,128 children with ALL (0.057%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.037-0.088%) died of VZV infection. The mortality rate was lower in North America (3 of 11,558 children, 0.026%; 95% CI, 0.009-0.076%) than in the Asian countries (2 of 4,882 children, 0.041%; 95% CI, 0.011-0.149%) and in Europe (15 of 18,688 children, 0.080%; 95% CI, 0.049-0.132%) consistent with the generally higher rate of VZV vaccination in North America. Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) died during the first year of treatment for ALL. One death was attributed to varicella vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: The negligible rate of fatal varicella infection in children with ALL, the risk that accompanies vaccination, and the necessity of withholding chemotherapy for vaccination appear to outweigh the potential benefit of varicella vaccination for children during treatment of ALL.","['Caniza MA', 'Hunger SP', 'Schrauder A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Pui CH', 'Masera G', 'Members of International Study Group of Childhood ALL ( “Ponte di Legno Working Group”)']",2012,58,1,Pediatr Blood Cancer,"Caniza MA, et al.

20844039,The varicella-zoster virus ORFS/L (ORF0) gene is required for efficient viral replication and contains an element involved in DNA cleavage.,"The genome of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a human alphaherpesvirus, consists of two unique regions, unique long (U(L)) and unique short (U(S)), each of which is flanked by inverted repeats. During replication, four isomers of the viral DNA are generated which are distinguished by the relative orientations of U(L) and U(S). VZV virions predominantly package two isomeric forms of the genome that have a fixed orientation of U(L). An open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function, ORFS/L, also referred to as ORF0, is located at the extreme terminus of U(L), directly adjacent to the a-like sequences, which are known to be involved in cleavage and packaging of viral DNA. We demonstrate here that the ORFS/L protein localizes to the Golgi network in infected and transfected cells. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that deletion of the predicted ORFS/L gene is lethal, while retention of the N-terminal 28 amino acid residues resulted in viable yet replication-impaired virus. The growth defect was only partially attributable to the expression of the ORFS/L product, suggesting that the 5' region of ORFS/L contains a sequence element crucial for cleavage/packaging of viral DNA. Consequently, mutations introduced into the extreme 5' terminus of ORFS/L resulted in a defect in DNA cleavage, indicating that the region is indeed involved in the processing of viral DNA. Since the sequence element has no counterpart at the other end of U(L), we concluded that our results can provide an explanation for the almost exclusive orientation of the U(L) seen in packaged VZV DNA.","['Kaufer BB', 'Smejkal B', 'Osterrieder N']",2010,84,22,J Virol,"Kaufer BB, et al.

How keloids grow is not totally clear because there is no animal model; in fact, keloids affect only humans. Different injuries can result in keloids, including burns, surgery, ear piercing, lacerations, abrasions, tattooing, vaccinations, injections, insect bites and any process causing skin inflammation (chicken pox, acne, folliculitis, zoster). Skin or wound tension is considered a critical factor in the formation of keloids and hypertrophic scars.

SVV antigens were detected in multiple ganglia from all immunosuppressed monkeys in every group, but not in controls. These results indicate that tacrolimus treatment produced reactivation in more monkeys than irradiation and tacrolimus and irradiation increased the frequency of SVV reactivation as compared to either treatment alone.","['Mahalingam R', 'Traina-Dorge V', 'Wellish M', 'Deharo E', 'Singletary ML', 'Ribka EP', 'Sanford R', 'Gilden D']",2010,16,5,J Neurovirol,"Mahalingam R, et al.

20817040,Evolution and world-wide distribution of varicella-zoster virus clades.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV, Human herpesvirus 3), a world-wide distributed pathogen, is the causative agent of varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles). Both diseases result in significant morbidity and economic burden. The implementation of routine varicella vaccination programs in many countries may reduce significantly the incidence of varicella disease. Furthermore, vaccination against zoster can diminish the burden of zoster considerably. Although many epidemiological, clinical and laboratory studies were performed in the past decades to reveal the clinical burden as well as epidemiological features and changes of the two diseases caused by VZV, a comparatively low number of molecular epidemiological studies have been performed to investigate and monitor the genetic variability and phylogenetic relationship of VZV strains throughout the world. To date, it is well established that VZV can be divided into five major clades confirmed by full-genome sequencing and two provisional clades that have to be confirmed. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated a regional dominance of specific VZV clades, most likely in dependence on environmental factors, evolutionary conditions and host-virus interactions and/or importation of viral strains. However, there are many open questions such as the alteration of genotype distribution through immigration or travel, the introduction of the varicella vaccine strain into population and the emergence of wild-type vaccine recombinant viruses. To increase our knowledge in this field by further innovative approaches, the new common nomenclature of VZV clades established recently will be very useful. In this review, the currently available data concerning the geographic distribution and evolution of VZV clades are summarized. Different models of VZV evolution and recombination are discussed and recent changes in VZV clade distribution addressed.","['Schmidt-Chanasit J', 'Sauerbrei A']",2011,11,1,Infect Genet Evol,Schmidt-Chanasit J and Sauerbrei A.

Trends were analysed using Poisson regression to determine if rates increased following funding of varicella immunization in Australia in November 2005. The regression analysis revealed significantly increasing trends of between 2% and 6% per year in both antiviral prescriptions and emergency-department presentations in all except the <20 years age group. When considered together, the differential changes in rates observed by age group provides preliminary evidence to indicate that HZ incidence is increasing in adults aged >20 years. However, it is not possible to attribute the increasing trends in HZ observed directly to the varicella immunization programme, and continued monitoring and analyses of data for a longer duration, both pre- and post-vaccine introduction, is required.","['Jardine A', 'Conaty SJ', 'Vally H']",2011,139,5,Epidemiol Infect,"Jardine A, et al.

20723217,Varicella vaccination coverage of children under two years of age in Germany.,"BACKGROUND: Since July 2004, routine varicella vaccination is recommended by the German Standing Vaccination Committee in Germany. Health Insurance Funds started to cover vaccination costs at different time points between 2004 and 2006 in the Federal States. Nationwide representative data on vaccination coverage against varicella of children under two years of age are not available. We aimed to determine varicella vaccination coverage in statutory health insured children under two years of age in twelve German Federal States using data from associations of statutory health insurance physicians (ASHIPs), in order to investigate the acceptance of the recommended routine varicella vaccination programme.
METHODS: We analysed data on varicella vaccination from 13 of 17 ASHIPs of the years 2004 to 2007. The study population consisted of all statutory health insured children under two years of age born in 2004 (cohort 2004) or 2005 (cohort 2005) in one of the studied regions. Vaccination coverage was determined by the number of children vaccinated under 2 years of age within the study population.
RESULTS: Varicella vaccination coverage of children under two years of age with either one dose of the monovalent varicella vaccine or two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine increased from 34% (cohort 2004) to 51% (cohort 2005) in the studied regions (p < 0.001). More than half of the vaccinated children of cohort 2004 and two third of cohort 2005 were immunised at the recommended age 11 to 14 months. The level of vaccination coverage of cohort 2004 was significantly associated with the delay in introduction of cost coverage since the recommendation of varicella vaccination (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows increasing varicella vaccination coverage of young children, indicating a growing acceptance of the routine varicella vaccination programme by the parents and physicians. We recommend further monitoring of vaccination coverage using data from ASHIPs to investigate acceptance of the routine vaccination programmes over time.","['Reuss AM', 'Feig M', 'Kappelmayer L', 'Siedler A', 'Eckmanns T', 'Poggensee G']",2010,10,,BMC Public Health,"Reuss AM, et al.

20707045,[Varicella complications: is it time to consider a routine varicella vaccination?].,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Varicella is a common and benign disease of childhood. Complications are rare, but in some patients, even without risk factors, severe, life treathening complications could be seen. The aim of this study was to establish the type and frequency of varicella complications among hospitalised patients over an 8-year period.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included medical charts of the patients hospitalised in the Infectious Disease Clinic, Belgrade, Serbia, from 2001-2008 (4.85% of all registered patients with varicella in Belgrade, 2001-2008). Among hospitalised patients dermografic characteristics were analysed: hospitalisation lenght, presence and type of complications, presence of immunocompromising conditions and outcome of the disease. The diagnosis of varicella was made on clinical grounds, and in persons >40 years, with negative epidemiological data of contacts, serological confirmation (ELISA VZV IgM/IgG BioRad) and avidity of IgG antibodies were done to exclude the possibility of disseminated herpes zoster.
RESULTS: A total of 474 patient were hospitalised over an 8-year period. The age of patients was from 5 months to 75 years (mean 22.4 +/- 16.1, median 23.5 years). The majority of patients were adults (n=279; 58.9%) and 195 (41.1%) patients were < or =15 years old. Complications were found in 321/474 (67.7%) patients. The registered complications were: varicella pneumonia (n=198; 41.38%), bacterial skin infections (n=40; 8.4%), cerebelitis (n=28; 5.9%), bacterial respiratory infection (n=21; 4.4%), viral meningitis (n=10; 2.31%), encephalitis (n=9; 1.9%), thrombocytopenia (n=2; 0.4%); 11 (2.3%) patients had more than one complication, among them were sepsis, myopericarditis and retinal hemorrhages. When complications were analysed according to the age, there were no statistical significance, but when type of complication was analysed statistical significance was found (p < 0.05). In adults, pneumonia was the most common complication: 173/279 (62%), followed by skin infections (2.9%), bacterial respiratory infections (2.2%), and more than one complication (2.3%). Pneumonia was more common in adults than in children (7:1). In children skin infections were the most common complications (16.4%), followed by cerebelitis (13.3%), viral pneumonia (12.8%), bacterial respiratory infections (7.7%), encephalitis (3.6%), and more than one complication (4.1%). Neuroinfections were more common in children than in adults (6:1), as well as bacterial skin infections (4:1). Two patients died (0.4%).
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the incidence of varicella complication in children and adults, but the type of complication differed. In children the most common complications were skin and neurological infections, while in adults it was varicella pneumonia. These data provide a baseline for estimating the burden of varicella in Belgrade and support the inclusion of varicella vaccine in childhood immunisation program in Serbia.","['Dulović O', 'Gvozdenović E', 'Nikolić J', 'Spurnić AR', 'Katanić N', 'Kovarević-Pavićević D']",2010,67,7,Vojnosanit Pregl,"Dulović O, et al.

20700972,[Viral patology and oral manifestation].,"UNLABELLED: Although the medical and biological importance of ringworm infections was acknowledged a long time ago, the putting-up-to-date of some clinical notions is justified for at least three reasons: the improvement and accessibility of molecular biology techniques, the consideration of the major pathogenic role of these viruses in circumstances of immune depression, the possibility to control these infections by means of specific chemotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was carried out in the interval 1.01.2006 - 31.12. 2008, of all cases of ringworm infections with oral eclat, hospitalised in Infectious Diseases Hospital Iaşi. The diagnosis was established according to the clinical manifestations, the hematological modifications and, if the case, serological examination.
RESULTS: The study included 291 cases. The infection with EVB (infectious mononucleosis) was diagnosed within the age interval 8 months-60 years (median-10 years). The oral manifestations were mainly located at the level of the palatine and velopalatine vault. Chickenpox was diagnosed within the age interval 7 days-52 years (median-8 years). The chickenpox enantem was observed in 90.42% of the cases, being represented by varix wounds, or ""hemorrhagic spots"", mostly located at the level of the fibrous mucose membrane of the palatine vault--40.2%.

METHODS: From 1993 to 2006, all women who presented vesicular rash or a suspicious contact were referred and evaluated in a special unit at our center. Those with residual immunity or were serologically negative were precluded from this study. Positive IgM cases underwent monthly ultrasound scans (US), fetal blood (FB) sampling (including IgM anti VZV and virus culture). Amniotic fluid sample for PCR was added to the diagnosis of positive IgM cases after 1997.
RESULTS: A total of 276, of the 566 consulted women, tested positive for IgM anti VZV. Seventeen (6%) were excluded because of an unadvised termination of pregnancy and seven (2.55%) miscarried. Only seven (2.7%) were considered highly likely to have a VZV fetal infection. One case showed positive IgM in FB but developed normally. Another fetus showed positive PCR and infection was confirmed post TOP. Four cases that underwent TOP and histochemistry confirmed no more cases. Complete post-natal follow-up was carried out. The asymptomatic infected child grew healthy until the completion of screening tests when it reached 5 years old.
CONCLUSION: The fetal infection rate in this cohort was 0.8%, but the best expected prevalence of CVS, according to our findings, should be 0.39% among infected women.

Currently available serological tests to detect VZV-specific antibodies are exclusively based on antigens derived from VZV-infected cells.
RESULTS: We present a systematic approach for the identification of novel, serologically reactive VZV antigens. Therefore, all VZV open reading frames were cloned into a bacterial expression vector and checked for small scale recombinant protein expression. Serum profiling experiments using purified VZV proteins and clinically defined sera in a microarray revealed 5 putative antigens (ORFs 1, 4, 14, 49, and 68). These were rearranged in line format and validated with pre-characterized sera.
CONCLUSIONS: The line assay confirmed the seroreactivity of the identified antigens and revealed its suitability for VZV serodiagnostics comparable to commercially available VZV-ELISA. Recombinant ORF68 (gE) proved to be an antigen for high-confidence determination of VZV serostatus. Furthermore, our data suggest that a serological differentiation between chickenpox and herpes zoster may be possible by analysis of the IgM-portfolio against individual viral antigens.","['Vizoso Pinto MG', 'Pfrepper KI', 'Janke T', 'Noelting C', 'Sander M', 'Lueking A', 'Haas J', 'Nitschko H', 'Jaeger G', 'Baiker A']",2010,7,,Virol J,"Vizoso Pinto MG, et al.

20642419,Evidence of increasing frequency of herpes zoster management in Australian general practice since the introduction of a varicella vaccine.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the management rate of herpes zoster (HZ) in Australian general practice has changed since varicella vaccines became available; and to ascertain the mean age of patients attending general practice for HZ management, to assist with planning of vaccination to prevent HZ in older Australians.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of data for the period April 1998 to March 2009 on 1,078,671 (weighted) management encounters with consecutive patients of 10,885 general practitioners who participated in the BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health) national cross-sectional survey.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of encounters for management of HZ (shingles) and of varicella (chickenpox); age of patients presenting for HZ management.
RESULTS: Regression analysis indicated a significant rise in the HZ management rate over the study period, with an average annual increase of 0.05 per 1000 encounters (P < 0.01). The management rate for varicella decreased significantly from 2.01 per 1000 encounters in 1998-1999 to 0.58 per 1000 in 2008-2009. Mean age calculated for each year of the study varied between 10.2 and 15.3 years for patients with varicella, and between 57.5 and 64.1 years for patients with HZ.
CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant rise in the HZ management rate and a decrease in the varicella management rate in Australian general practice over the period 1998-2009.

20639716,Varicella vaccination in children with inflammatory bowel disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy.,"Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy to stay in clinical remission; however, these therapies also put patients at risk for infections. Therefore, it is important to immunize children to minimize vaccine-preventable infections. However, there is a paucity of data on immune response to vaccines in patients with IBD. Current guidelines recommend that patients with IBD receive inactivated vaccines but suggest against immunizing immunosuppressed patients having IBD with live vaccines such as varicella. Unfortunately, the recommendation to not vaccinate with varicella was not based on any data. We present a case series of children with IBD receiving immunosuppressive therapy who tolerated and had a good immune response to varicella vaccine. We also review the literature and demonstrate that studies in other immunocompromised populations suggest that varicella vaccine is generally well tolerated and immunogenic. We also argue that it is important to weigh the benefits against risks with individual patients having IBD to decide whether varicella vaccination should be considered. Additional studies evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of varicella vaccine in patients with IBD are needed.","['Lu Y', 'Bousvaros A']",2010,50,5,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,Lu Y and Bousvaros A.

Patients are presumed to develop crossreacting autoantibodies to the virus and protein S. There is no consensus on how best to manage these patients but previous recommendations focus on plasmapheresis and plasma exchange. We report the case of a 3-year-old girl with post varicella purpura fulminans owing to protein S deficiency, who was diagnosed promptly and made a full recovery following immediate treatment with anticoagulation and plasma support. This suggests that if anticoagulation is used, plasma exchange is not always necessary. As recovery occurred without plasmapheresis, we were able to track protein S levels. The timing of protein S recovery was consistent with the waning titre of an acquired immunoglobulin G autoantibody.","['Thomson JJ', 'Retter A', 'Hunt BJ']",2010,21,6,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,"Thomson JJ, et al.

20624648,Association between varicella zoster virus infection and atopic dermatitis in early and late childhood: a case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: Wild-type varicella zoster virus infection (WTVZV) early in childhood has been shown to protect against the development of asthma and atopy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether WTVZV in childhood protects against atopic dermatitis (AD).
METHODS: This retrospective, practice-based, case-control study randomly sampled 256 children and adolescents (age 1-18 years) with AD and 422 age-matched healthy controls from 2005 to 2007. Observations were made before the a priori hypothesis.
RESULTS: (1) A single episode of WTVZV in childhood is associated with decreased odds ratio (OR) of developing AD (conditional logistic regression; OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34-0.89; P = .01). (2) When using intervals for age corresponding to bimodal distribution of age of WTVZV infection, the effects of WTVZV infection are significant when occurring at age 0 to 8 years (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.90; P = .02), but not at 8 to 18 years (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.19-1.31; P = .16). Considering 5-year intervals has similar findings. (3) WTVZV is associated with decreased odds of moderate AD (multinomial logistic regression; OR, 0.08, 95% CI, 0.04-0.15; P < .0001) or severe AD (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.13; P < .0001). (4) WTVZV in children is associated with prolonged AD-free survival (Kaplan-Meier; median, 15.3 years; 95% CI, 10.9-18.0) compared with controls (median, 7.5 years; 95% CI, 4.8-11.9; log-rank test, P < .0001). (5) Children with WTVZV, compared with vaccine, who eventually develop AD require fewer pediatrician sick visits for management of AD (logistic regression; OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.51; P = .001).
CONCLUSION: WTVZV in childhood protects up to 10 years of age against AD, delays onset of AD symptoms, and decreases AD severity and office visits.","['Silverberg JI', 'Norowitz KB', 'Kleiman E', 'Silverberg NB', 'Durkin HG', 'Joks R', 'Smith-Norowitz TA']",2010,126,2,J Allergy Clin Immunol,"Silverberg JI, et al.

20617166,Genome-wide mutagenesis reveals that ORF7 is a novel VZV skin-tropic factor.,"The Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous human alpha-herpesvirus that is the causative agent of chicken pox and shingles. Although an attenuated VZV vaccine (v-Oka) has been widely used in children in the United States, chicken pox outbreaks are still seen, and the shingles vaccine only reduces the risk of shingles by 50%. Therefore, VZV still remains an important public health concern. Knowledge of VZV replication and pathogenesis remains limited due to its highly cell-associated nature in cultured cells, the difficulty of generating recombinant viruses, and VZV's almost exclusive tropism for human cells and tissues. In order to circumvent these hurdles, we cloned the entire VZV (p-Oka) genome into a bacterial artificial chromosome that included a dual-reporter system (GFP and luciferase reporter genes). We used PCR-based mutagenesis and the homologous recombination system in the E. coli to individually delete each of the genome's 70 unique ORFs. The collection of viral mutants obtained was systematically examined both in MeWo cells and in cultured human fetal skin organ samples. We use our genome-wide deletion library to provide novel functional annotations to 51% of the VZV proteome. We found 44 out of 70 VZV ORFs to be essential for viral replication. Among the 26 non-essential ORF deletion mutants, eight have discernable growth defects in MeWo. Interestingly, four ORFs were found to be required for viral replication in skin organ cultures, but not in MeWo cells, suggesting their potential roles as skin tropism factors. One of the genes (ORF7) has never been described as a skin tropic factor. The global profiling of the VZV genome gives further insights into the replication and pathogenesis of this virus, which can lead to improved prevention and therapy of chicken pox and shingles.","['Zhang Z', 'Selariu A', 'Warden C', 'Huang G', 'Huang Y', 'Zaccheus O', 'Cheng T', 'Xia N', 'Zhu H']",2010,6,7,PLoS Pathog,"Zhang Z, et al.

20600490,Varicella vaccination coverage in Bavaria (Germany) after general vaccine recommendation in 2004.,"Since 2004, general varicella vaccination has been recommended for all children 11-14 months of age in Germany. The objective of this study was to examine vaccination coverage in children and factors associated with parental acceptance during the first years after recommendation. In a regional surveillance area, cross-sectional parent surveys were conducted in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in random samples (n=600) of children aged 18-36 months; data were obtained for 372, 364 and 352 children, respectively. Parents were questioned on their child's varicella disease history, and on varicella vaccination status as recorded in the child's vaccination booklet. Overall coverage increased from 38% in 2006 to 51% in 2007 and stagnated at 53% in 2008; in susceptible children (without previous varicella disease until vaccination or time of survey) coverage was 42%, 61% and 59%, respectively. Recommendation by the paediatrician as reported by the parents increased from 48% (2006) to 57% (2007) and 60% (2008), and was the main independent factor associated with parental acceptance. In 32-35% of unvaccinated children parents had not yet decided whether to vaccinate against varicella. Additional programmes targeting paediatricians' and parents' acceptance of varicella vaccination are needed to achieve the WHO-defined goal of at least 85% coverage.","['Streng A', 'Seeger K', 'Grote V', 'Liese JG']",2010,28,35,Vaccine,"Streng A, et al.

20600487,Safety profile of live varicella virus vaccine (Oka/Merck): five-year results of the European Varicella Zoster Virus Identification Program (EU VZVIP).,"BACKGROUND: VARIVAX (Oka/Merck) is a live varicella vaccine, licensed in Europe since 2003. In addition to routine safety surveillance, the Varicella Zoster Virus Identification Program (VZVIP) analyzes clinical samples to establish whether adverse events (AEs) are associated with wild-type (wt) or vaccine varicella zoster virus (vVZV) strain. The European VZVIP provides data on VZV clade distribution.
METHODS: Samples were collected from patients with selected AEs; the VZV strain was determined using polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: From October 2003 to September 2008, 1006 spontaneous AE reports were analyzed (88% non-serious). Samples from 76/585 cases with selected AEs were collected. Of 55 VZV-positive/typable samples, wtVZV was detected in 40 and vVZV in 15 samples. Most rashes (32/44) <or=42 days postvaccination were associated with wtVZV. For breakthrough varicella, 6/9 cases were wtVZV-positive; none were vVZV-positive. For herpes zoster 9/17 cases were VZV-positive: eight vVZV, one wtVZV. One case of mild encephalitis was associated with vVZV. One of three cases of suspected secondary vVZV transmission was confirmed. Most wtVZV was clade 3 and clade 1.
CONCLUSIONS: European experience confirms that Oka/Merck vaccine is generally well tolerated. wtVZV genotypes were consistent with the molecular epidemiology of VZV in Europe.","['Goulleret N', 'Mauvisseau E', 'Essevaz-Roulet M', 'Quinlivan M', 'Breuer J']",2010,28,36,Vaccine,"Goulleret N, et al.

20600297,Humoral immunity following chickenpox is influenced by geography and ethnicity.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the contribution of ethnicity and geographical location to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) serostatus and antibody concentrations.
METHODS: The presence and concentrations of antibodies to VZV were measured in 639 Bangladeshi women born in Bangladesh (BBB), 94 Bangladeshi women born in the UK (BUK) and 262 White women born in the UK (WUK). The results were analysed in relation to demographic and social data.
RESULTS: BBB women were significantly less likely to be VZV seropositive at all ages than both BUK and WUK women. However, the odds of a Bangladeshi-born woman being seropositive increased by 1.04 for each year under the age of 15 spent in the UK. In contrast, antibody concentrations were significantly lower in ethnic Bangladeshi women, irrespective of country of birth. White, but not Bangladeshi women, showed evidence of antibody boosting over time despite the latter having more exposure to children.
CONCLUSION: Geographical location during childhood is the major influence on age of primary infection with VZV while the level of antibody is related to ethnicity. Since the risk of re-infection with VZV following both natural infection and vaccination is increased as antibody concentrations fall, these results have implications for VZV vaccination programmes particularly in non-White populations.","['Ayres KL', 'Talukder Y', 'Breuer J']",2010,61,3,J Infect,"Ayres KL, et al.

20587679,Measles-mumps-rubella-varicella combination vaccine and the risk of febrile seizures.,"OBJECTIVE: In February 2008, we alerted the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to preliminary evidence of a twofold increased risk of febrile seizures after the combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine when compared with separate measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines. Now with data on twice as many vaccine recipients, our goal was to reexamine seizure risk after MMRV vaccine.
METHODS: Using 2000-2008 Vaccine Safety Datalink data, we assessed seizures and fever visits among children aged 12 to 23 months after MMRV and separate MMR + varicella vaccines. We compared seizure risk after MMRV vaccine to that after MMR + varicella vaccines by using Poisson regression as well as with supplementary regressions that incorporated chart-review results and self-controlled analyses.
RESULTS: MMRV vaccine recipients (83,107) were compared with recipients of MMR + varicella vaccines (376,354). Seizure and fever significantly clustered 7 to 10 days after vaccination with all measles-containing vaccines but not after varicella vaccination alone. Seizure risk during days 7 to 10 was higher after MMRV than after MMR + varicella vaccination (relative risk: 1.98 [95% confidence interval: 1.43-2.73]). Supplementary analyses yielded similar results. The excess risk for febrile seizures 7 to 10 days after MMRV compared with separate MMR + varicella vaccination was 4.3 per 10,000 doses (95% confidence interval: 2.6-5.6).
CONCLUSIONS: Among 12- to 23-month-olds who received their first dose of measles-containing vaccine, fever and seizure were elevated 7 to 10 days after vaccination. Vaccination with MMRV results in 1 additional febrile seizure for every 2300 doses given instead of separate MMR + varicella vaccines. Providers who recommend MMRV should communicate to parents that it increases the risk of fever and seizure over that already associated with measles-containing vaccines.","['Klein NP', 'Fireman B', 'Yih WK', 'Lewis E', 'Kulldorff M', 'Ray P', 'Baxter R', 'Hambidge S', 'Nordin J', 'Naleway A', 'Belongia EA', 'Lieu T', 'Baggs J', 'Weintraub E', 'Vaccine Safety Datalink']",2010,126,1,Pediatrics,"Klein NP, et al.

20573825,Characterization of the host immune response in human Ganglia after herpes zoster.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chicken pox) and establishes latency in ganglia, from where it reactivates to cause herpes zoster (shingles), which is often followed by postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), causing severe neuropathic pain that can last for years after the rash. Despite the major impact of herpes zoster and PHN on quality of life, the nature and kinetics of the virus-immune cell interactions that result in ganglion damage have not been defined. We obtained rare material consisting of seven sensory ganglia from three donors who had suffered from herpes zoster between 1 and 4.5 months before death but who had not died from herpes zoster. We performed immunostaining to investigate the site of VZV infection and to phenotype immune cells in these ganglia. VZV antigen was localized almost exclusively to neurons, and in at least one case it persisted long after resolution of the rash. The large immune infiltrate consisted of noncytolytic CD8(+) T cells, with lesser numbers of CD4(+) T cells, B cells, NK cells, and macrophages and no dendritic cells. VZV antigen-positive neurons did not express detectable major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, nor did CD8(+) T cells surround infected neurons, suggesting that mechanisms of immune control may not be dependent on direct contact. This is the first report defining the nature of the immune response in ganglia following herpes zoster and provides evidence for persistence of non-latency-associated viral antigen and inflammation beyond rash resolution.","['Gowrishankar K', 'Steain M', 'Cunningham AL', 'Rodriguez M', 'Blumbergs P', 'Slobedman B', 'Abendroth A']",2010,84,17,J Virol,"Gowrishankar K, et al.

20563710,Varicella zoster virus immune evasion strategies.,"The capacity of varicella zoster virus (VZV) to cause varicella (chickenpox) relies upon multiple steps, beginning with inoculation of the host at mucosal sites with infectious virus in respiratory droplets. Despite the presence of a powerful immune defense system, this virus is able to disseminate from the site of initial infection to multiple sites, resulting in the emergence of distinctive cutaneous vesiculopustular lesions. Most recently, it has been proposed that the steps leading to cutaneous infection include VZV infecting human tonsillar CD4(+) T cells that express skin homing markers that allow them to transport VZV directly from the lymph node to the skin during the primary viremia. It has also been proposed that dendritic cells (DC) of the respiratory mucosa may be among the first cells to encounter VZV and these cells may transport virus to the draining lymph node. These various virus-host cell interactions would all need to occur in the face of an intact host immune response for the virus to successfully cause disease. Significantly, following primary exposure to VZV, there is a prolonged incubation period before emergence of skin lesions, during which time the adaptive immune response is delayed. For these reasons, it has been proposed that VZV must encode functions which benefit the virus by evading the immune response. This chapter will review the diverse array of immunomodulatory mechanisms identified to date that VZV has evolved to at least transiently limit immune recognition.","['Abendroth A', 'Kinchington PR', 'Slobedman B']",2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Abendroth A, et al.

20553364,Subcision-suction method: a new successful combination therapy in treatment of atrophic acne scars and other depressed scars.,"BACKGROUND: Among therapeutic modalities of acne scars, subcision is a simple, safe procedure with a different and basic mechanism for correcting atrophic and depressed scars. Subcision releases scar surfaces from underlying attachments and induces connective tissue formation beneath the scar directly, without injury to the skin surface. Therefore, subcision is a valuable method, but due to high recurrence rate, its efficacy is mild to moderate.
OBJECTIVES: To increase the efficacy of subcision, a new complementary treatment of repeated suction sessions was added at the recurrence period of subcised scars.
METHODS: In this before and after trail, 58 patients with mild to severe acne scars of various types (rolling, superficial and deep boxcar, pitted), chicken pox, traumatic and surgical depressed scars were treated by superficial dermal undermining, with mainly 23-guage needles. The protocol for suctioning was: start of suction on third day after subcision for flat and depressing subcised scars and its continuation at least every other day for 2 weeks.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients followed the protocol completely, had 60-90% improvement in depth and size of scars (significant improvement) with mean: 71.73%. 28.2% of them had '80% improvement or more' (excellent improvement). Twelve patients started suction late and/or had long interval suction-sessions, had 30-60% improvement (moderate improvement) with mean: 43.75%.
CONCLUSION: Frequent suctioning at the recurrence period of subcision increases subcision efficacy remarkably and causes significant and persistent improvement in short time, without considerable complication, in depressed scars of the face. Therefore, subcision-suction method is introduced as a new effective treatment.","['Aalami Harandi S', 'Balighi K', 'Lajevardi V', 'Akbari E']",2011,25,1,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Aalami Harandi S, et al.

20551153,Incidence and risk of hospitalisation due to shingles and chickenpox in patients with rheumatic diseases treated with TNF antagonists.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of hospitalisation due to varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection in patients treated with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists for inflammatory rheumatic conditions and to compare it with the expected rate in the general population.
METHODS: Secondary data analysis was performed of two large databases: (1) the national registry of rheumatic diseases patients treated with biological agents (BIOBADASER); and (2) the national hospital discharge database Conjunto Mínimo Básico de Datos al Alta Hospitalaria. Hospitalisations due to shingles or chickenpox were analysed. For each condition the incidence rate (IR) and the age and gender standardised IR per 100,000 person-years plus the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and the standardised incidence difference (SID) were estimated.
RESULTS: In patients exposed to TNF antagonists, the estimated IR of hospitalisation due to shingles was 32 cases per 100,000 patient-years (95% CI 14 to 78), the expected rate in the general population was 3.4 (95% CI 3.2 to 3.5), the SIR was 9 (95% CI 3 to 20) and the SID was 26 (95% CI 14 to 37). The estimated IR of hospitalisation due to chickenpox was 26 cases per 100,000 (95% CI 10 to 69), the expected rate was 1.9 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.0), the SIR was 19 (95% CI 5 to 47) and the SID 33 (95% CI 21 to 45).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering rheumatic diseases exposed to TNF antagonists are hospitalised due to VZV infections significantly more frequently than expected in the general population. Since the absolute IR of hospitalisations due to chickenpox and shingles is low in these patients, the implementation of risky preventive measures may not be justified at present.","['García-Doval I', 'Pérez-Zafrilla B', 'Descalzo MA', 'Roselló R', 'Hernández MV', 'Gómez-Reino JJ', 'Carmona L', 'BIOBADASER 2.0 Study Group']",2010,69,10,Ann Rheum Dis,"García-Doval I, et al.

20538515,Evaluation of anti-varicella antibody in young women before their marriage: A sero-epidemiologic study in Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Chickenpox during pregnancy can cause severe complications in both the mother and her baby. However, no complications will occur in a mother with proper immunity. Therefore, physicians and health systems can make better decisions when they know the immunologic status of the women in a community.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to clarify the Varicella zoster virus (VZV) immune status of engaged women in Iran.
STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on 334 young women who intended to marry between 2006 and 2008. The subjects' VZV-immunoglobulin G (IgG) and demographic characteristics were evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 20.5+/-4.9 years and their mean anti-varicella value was 86.22+/-71.05 U ml(-1). Of 333 young women studied, 242 (72.7%) were positive, 89 (26.7%) were negative for anti-varicella antibody and two were equivocal (0.6%). The rate of immunity increased with increasing age; all of the subjects over 35 years of age were immune to varicella. The positive predictive value (PPV) for self-reported history of chickenpox in subjects was estimated to be 79.5% and the negative predictive value (NPV) of a negative or uncertain disease history was 30.5%. A higher immune ratio was seen in women with more siblings.
CONCLUSIONS: The difference in the proportion of VZV-immune people in our country versus developed countries may be due to the introduction of varicella vaccine in developed nations. The mean age at first pregnancy in Iran is 25.7 years and the results of our study indicate that more than one-fourth of these women are not immune to varicella. We therefore recommend vaccination in women, especially those who are under 35 years of age. Number of siblings and positive history of varicella infection may be the indicators to determine the immunity level of a pregnant woman who has had contact with a patient with chickenpox.","['Pourahmad M', 'Davami MH', 'Jahromi AR']",2010,48,4,J Clin Virol,"Pourahmad M, et al.

Vaccination is the best method to prevent the disease. The objective of this study was to assess the level of knowledge, attitude and vaccination status of varicella among UKM students. A cross sectional study involving pre-tested questionnaires was undertaken between February and April, 2005. Questionnaires were distributed and filled by the first and second year students from four faculties in UKM (n=879). The faculties included were divided into two categories: medical fields and non-medical fields. The results showed that the overall level of knowledge on varicella among respondents was intermediate. The score of knowledge was significantly higher among medical students (t = 10.9, p < 0.05) compared to non-medical students. The varicella vaccination coverage was low among UKM students (19.3%). The vaccination status was significantly higher among medical students compared to non-medical students (chi2 = 8.6, p < 0.05). Vaccination status of varicella among respondents had no association with the level of knowledge (chi2 = 2.42, p > 0.05).

20525895,Identification of an important immunological difference between virulent varicella-zoster virus and its avirulent vaccine: viral disruption of dendritic cell instruction.,"Virulent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can spread in immunocompetent humans, resulting in symptoms mostly of the skin. In contrast, vaccine Oka (V-Oka), the attenuated VZV vaccine strain, only rarely causes clinical reactions. The mechanisms underlying these pathogenetic differences are unclear. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the ability of virulent VZV and V-Oka to modulate instruction of dendritic cells (DCs) by innate signals. DCs isolated from normal human skin were susceptible to infection with VZV and V-Oka. Moreover, inflammatory DCs, which play a crucial role in the stimulation of Th1 immune responses, accumulated in herpes zoster lesions. Infection of inflammatory DCs generated in vitro with virulent VZV or V-Oka resulted in upregulation of CD1c. Upon coculture with CD1c-restricted innate cells, DCs developed a mature phenotype whether infected with virulent VZV or V-Oka. Intriguingly, a striking difference was detected on the functional level. The release of IFN-gamma and IL-12, the signature cytokines of Th1 responses, was enhanced by V-Oka but blocked by virulent VZV. V-Oka and virulent VZV efficiently synergized with CD40L, eliminating the possibility that CD40 signaling was a target of VZV-associated immune evasion. Instead, virulent VZV selectively interfered with signaling through TLR2, which is known to sense VZV. Thus, virulent VZV subverts Th1-promoting instruction of human DCs by blocking TLR2-mediated innate signals that prime IL-12 production by DCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel immune-evasion mechanism of virulent VZV that has been lost during the attenuation process leading to the VZV vaccine strain.","['Gutzeit C', 'Raftery MJ', 'Peiser M', 'Tischer KB', 'Ulrich M', 'Eberhardt M', 'Stockfleth E', 'Giese T', 'Sauerbrei A', 'Morita CT', 'Schönrich G']",2010,185,1,J Immunol,"Gutzeit C, et al.

20514382,Systematic analysis of the IgG antibody immune response against varicella zoster virus (VZV) using a self-assembled protein microarray.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human herpesvirus encoding at least 69 distinct viral proteins which causes chickenpox after primary infection and shingles during reactivation and which is particularly important in pregnancy and immunocompromised patients. Current serodiagnostic tests are either based on whole cell lysates or glycoprotein preparations. In order to investigate the humoral immune response to VZV infection or vaccination in more detail, and to improve the currently available diagnostic assays, we developed a nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) containing all 69 VZV proteins and performed a detailed analysis of 68 sera from individuals with either no, a previous or an acute VZV infection. In addition to the known reactive glycoprotein antigens (ORF 5, ORF 14, ORF 31, ORF 37, ORF 68), we discovered IgG antibodies against a variety of other membrane (ORF 2, ORF 24), capsid (ORF 20, ORF 23, ORF 43) and tegument (ORF 53, ORF 9, ORF 11) proteins, as well as other proteins involved in virus replication and assembly (ORF 25, ORF 26, ORF 28) and the transactivator proteins ORF 12, ORF 62 and ORF 63. All of these antigens were only reactive in a subset of VZV-positive individuals. A subset of the newly identified VZV antigens was validated by western blot analysis.

20510263,Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of herpes zoster.,"The primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection results in chickenpox (varicella), which is transmitted via the airborne route. VZV is highly infectious, but in the USA the incidence of varicella has been reduced by 76-87% as a result of the varicella vaccine. The virus establishes latency in the dorsal root ganglia during varicella and, when reactivated, travels along the sensory nerve axons to cause shingles (herpes zoster [HZ]). There are over 1 million cases of HZ in the USA each year, with an estimated lifetime attack rate of 30%. The incidence of HZ, which causes significant morbidity, increases with age and reaches approximately 10 cases per 1,000 patient-years by age 80. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is known to decline with age as part of immunosenescence, and decreased CMI is associated with reactivation of VZV. This article provides an overview of our emerging understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of varicella and HZ, in addition to exploring the current theories on latency and reactivation. Understanding the risk factors for developing HZ and the complications associated with infection, particularly in older people, is important for prompt diagnosis and management of HZ in primary care, and they are therefore also reviewed.","['Gershon AA', 'Gershon MD', 'Breuer J', 'Levin MJ', 'Oaklander AL', 'Griffiths PD']",2010,48 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,J Clin Virol,"Gershon AA, et al.

This study examined the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of the 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) when coadministered with MMRV vaccine.
METHODS: In this open, controlled study, 325 healthy children aged 12 to 14 months were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: the first group (N = 110) received PHiD-CV and MMRV vaccine followed 6 to 8 weeks later by MMRV and DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccines; the second group (N = 101) received DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and MMRV vaccines followed 6 to 8 weeks later by PHiD-CV and MMRV vaccine; the third group (N = 114) received PHiD-CV and DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine during 1 vaccination visit. Immune responses were assessed with GlaxoSmithKline's 22F-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (for PHiD-CV), commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (for MMR), or indirect immunofluorescence assay (for varicella). Adverse events were recorded by the parents/guardians.
RESULTS: After the first vaccination, 2 peaks in fever (rectal temperature > or =38 degrees C) were observed; at days 0 to 2, related to PHiD-CV and DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccination, and at days 4 to 12, related to MMRV vaccination.

20504232,Evaluation of laboratory methods for diagnosis of varicella.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of varicella disease is declining as a result of vaccination, making clinical diagnosis more challenging, particularly for vaccine-modified cases. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of laboratory tests and specimen types to assess diagnostic performance and determine what role testing can play after skin lesions have resolved.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with suspected varicella disease in 2 communities. Enrollees were visited at the time of rash onset and 2 weeks later. Multiple skin lesion, oral, urine, and blood or serum specimens were requested at each visit and tested for varicella zoster virus (VZV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA antibody by enzyme-linked immunoassay; for VZV antigen by direct fluorescent antibody; and/or for VZV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinical certainty of the diagnosis of varicella disease was scored. PCR results from first-visit vesicles or scab specimens served as the gold standard in assessing test performance.
RESULTS: Of 93 enrollees, 53 were confirmed to have varicella disease. Among 20 unmodified cases, PCR testing was 95%-100% sensitive for macular and/or papular lesions and for oral specimens collected at the first visit; most specimens from the second visit yielded negative results. Among 27 vaccine-modified cases, macular and/or papular lesions collected at the first visit were also 100% sensitive; yields from other specimens were poorer, and few specimens from the second visit tested positive. Clinical diagnosis was 100% and 85% sensitive for diagnosing unmodified and vaccine-modified varicella cases, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: PCR testing of skin lesion specimens remains convenient and accurate for diagnosing varicella disease in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. PCR of oral specimens can sometimes aid in diagnosis of varicella disease, even after rash resolves.","['Leung J', 'Harpaz R', 'Baughman AL', 'Heath K', 'Loparev V', 'Vázquez M', 'Watson BM', 'Schmid DS']",2010,51,1,Clin Infect Dis,"Leung J, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To test crewmembers during their pre-employment medical examination to determine who might be susceptible to contract varicella if exposed, to vaccinate those at risk, and to see whether the benefits of testing and vaccination outweigh the costs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tests were conducted on 121 Indian seafarers for varicella IgG and IgM antibodies during their pre-employment medical examination in Mumbai and Goa from December 1st to December 23rd 2008. Cases without IgG antibodies to varicella (IgG negative) were administered vaccine.
RESULTS: Twenty (16.5%) seafarers who tested IgG negative and one who tested equivocally were administered the vaccine. One hundred (82.7%) tested positive for IgG antibodies and were therefore not vaccinated. None tested positive for IgM antibodies, indicating no active infection.
CONCLUSIONS: One in six Indian seafarers tested IgG negative and was thus at risk to contract varicella if exposed. Testing for varicella IgG and IgM antibodies, followed by vaccination when necessary, is a costeffective method to prevent an expensive outbreak in the semi-confined setting of a cruise ship and is recommended as a mandatory part of the pre-employment medical examination for Indian seafarers.",['Idnani N'],2010,61,1,Int Marit Health,Idnani N.

20496325,Public health significance of chickenpox on ships - conclusions drawn from a case series in the port of Hamburg.,"BACKGROUND: Despite international notification requirements, the magnitude of disease transmission on board ships remains undetermined. This case series aims to exemplify that varicella aboard ships is a topic of interest for maritime medicine and of public health significance.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic presentation of cases of chickenpox reported to the Hamburg Port Health Authority between November 2007 and April 2008. A systematic literature search on 'ships and chickenpox' was performed.
RESULTS: Five crew cases of chickenpox were reported from two passenger ships and two cargo ships. The cases originated from Indonesia (2), the Philippines (1), and Sri Lanka (2). Three cases were notified by the shipmaster, one by a general practitioner, and one by the immigration service. Sources of infection were other crewmembers, passengers, and persons in the home countries.
CONCLUSIONS: This description of five varicella cases aboard ships points to the significance of the disease among seafarers. Many seafarers originate from tropical countries where seroconversion to varicella zoster virus generally occurs in late adolescents and adults. Thus, a substantial portion of the crew may be non-immune and have the potential to introduce the disease from their home country to the ship, or are at risk for infection on the ship. Port health authorities, shipmasters, and doctors need to be well informed about the relevance of chickenpox on ships and the recommended control measures. Travellers should be advised to report to the ship doctor with any signs of infectious disease.","['Schlaich C', 'Riemer T', 'Lamshöft M', 'Hagelstein JG', 'Oldenburg M']",2010,61,1,Int Marit Health,"Schlaich C, et al.

20490778,Roles of cellular transcription factors in VZV replication.,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the causative agent of chickenpox and shingles. During productive infection the complete VZV proteome consisting of some 68 unique gene products is expressed through interaction of a small number of viral transcriptional activators with the general transcription apparatus of the host cell. Recent work has shown that the major viral transactivator, commonly designated the IE62 protein, interacts with the human Mediator of transcription. This interaction requires direct contact between the MED25 subunit of Mediator and the acidic N-terminal transactivation domain of IE62. A second cellular factor, host cell factor-1, has been shown to be the common element in two mechanisms of activation of the promoter driving expression of the gene encoding IE62. Finally, the ubiquitous cellular transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and YY1 have been shown to interact with sequences near the VZV origin of DNA replication and in the case of Sp1/Sp3 to influence replication efficiency.",['Ruyechan WT'],2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Ruyechan WT.

20483530,Varicella zoster virus in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The apparent association between varicella zoster virus (VZV) and multiple sclerosis (MS) has been described. In patients with relapse/remission (R/R) MS we have found high loads of VZV DNA in lymphocytes and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as abundant viral particles in CSF visualized by electron microscopy at the time of relapse. Both, the molecular and the ultrastructural evidence of VZV became negative in the same patients at the time of remission.
METHODS: In the present study we analyzed the presence of VZV in patients with progressive forms of MS; DNA from VZV was searched by real-time PCR in blood lymphocytes and in CSF of 20 patients with progressive MS. Ultrastructural study searching for viral particles in CSF was made with transmission electron microscopy.
RESULTS: VZV DNA was found in the CSF from 65% of cases with progressive MS- and VZV-like viral particles were found in 30% of these patients. Nonetheless, the amount of DNA and the number of viral particles were lower than those that have been found in MS patients with R/R at the time of relapse, but higher than those found during remission.
CONCLUSION: Similar to findings in patients with R/R MS, VZV might be associated to progressive MS, but in minor quantity. In these cases, the virus may produce a chronic, relentless infection or trigger a process of immune-mediated demyelination.","['Ordoñez G', 'Martinez-Palomo A', 'Corona T', 'Pineda B', 'Flores-Rivera J', 'Gonzalez A', 'Chavez-Munguia B', 'Sotelo J']",2010,112,8,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,"Ordoñez G, et al.

20473790,VZV T cell-mediated immunity.,"Primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection (varicella) induces VZV-specific antibody and VZV-specific T cell-mediated immunity. T cell-mediated immunity, which is detected within 1-2 weeks after appearance of rash, and consists of both CD4 and CD8 effector and memory T cells, is essential for recovery from varicella. Administration of a varicella vaccine also generates VZV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. The memory cell responses that develop during varicella or after vaccination contribute to protection following re-exposure to VZV. These responses are subsequently boosted either by endogenous re-exposure (silent reactivation of latent virus) or exogenous re-exposure (environmental). VZV-specific T cell-mediated immunity is also necessary to maintain latent VZV in a subclinical state in sensory ganglia. When these responses decline, as occurs with aging or iatrogenic immune suppression, reactivation of VZV leads to herpes zoster. Similarly, the magnitude of these responses early after the onset of herpes zoster correlates with the extent of zoster-associated pain. These essential immune responses are boosted by the VZV vaccine developed to prevent herpes zoster.","['Weinberg A', 'Levin MJ']",2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Weinberg A and Levin MJ.

20472806,Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases of nonhuman primates in the laboratory setting.,"Despite numerous advances in the diagnosis and control of infectious diseases of nonhuman primates in the laboratory setting, a number of infectious agents continue to plague colonies. Some, such as measles virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cause sporadic outbreaks despite well-established biosecurity protocols, whereas others, such as retroperitoneal fibromatosis-associated herpesvirus, have only recently been discovered, often as a result of immunosuppressive experimental manipulation. Owing to the unique social housing requirements of nonhuman primates, importation of foreign-bred animals, and lack of antemortem diagnostic assays for many new diseases, elimination of these agents is often difficult or impractical. Recognition of these diseases is therefore essential because of their confounding effects on experimental data, impact on colony health, and potential for zoonotic transmission. This review summarizes the relevant pathology and pathogenesis of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases of laboratory nonhuman primates.","['Bailey C', 'Mansfield K']",2010,47,3,Vet Pathol,Bailey C and Mansfield K.

20466839,Prevalence of varicella-zoster virus genotypes in Australia characterized by high-resolution melt analysis and ORF22 gene analyses.,"DNA sequence variation analysis has divided varicella-zoster virus (VZV; Human herpesvirus 3) into distinct geographical clades: European, Asian, African and Japanese. These genotypes are becoming increasingly prevalent within regions atypical to their original source and there has been the suggestion of recombination between genotypes. Seventy-eight clinical isolates from hospitalized patients with varicella were collected in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Victoria from 2006 to 2009. The wild-type strains and the vaccine strain (vOka) were differentiated by single nucleotide polymorphism detection using high-resolution melt analysis of five target genes (ORF1, -21, -37, -60 and -62), and by DNA sequence analysis of a 484 bp region of ORF22. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 46 % (36/78) of the clinical isolates were European clade 1 (C/E1) strains, 21 % (16/78) were European clade 3 (B/E2) strains, 12 % (9/78) were Asian/African clade 5 (A/M1) strains, 10 % (8/78) were clade 4 (J2/M2), 6 % (5/78) were clade 2 (J/J) and 5 % (4/78) belonged to the novel clade VI. No significant association was shown between VZV genotype and region, age or gender. Although European strains were most common, the results suggest an increase in African/Asian, Japanese and clade VI genotypes circulating in Australia.","['Toi CS', 'Dwyer DE']",2010,59,Pt 8,J Med Microbiol,Toi CS and Dwyer DE.

20465846,Incidence and effects of Varicella Zoster Virus infection on academic activities of medical undergraduates--a five-year follow-up study from Sri Lanka.,"BACKGROUND: The adult population in Sri Lanka is having high level of susceptibility for Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) infection. Among medical undergraduates, 47% are VZV seronegative. The purpose of the present study was to determine the incidence of VZV infection in medical undergraduates in Sri Lanka, and to describe the effects of VZV infection on their academic activities.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of medical undergraduates' susceptible for VZV infection was selected from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. Data on the incidence of VZV infection (Chickenpox) during their undergraduate period was collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. A second questionnaire was administered to collect data on the details of VZV infection and the impact of it on their academic activities. VZV incidence rate was calculated as the number of infections per 1,000 person years of exposure. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the impact of VZV infection on academic activities.
RESULTS: Out of the 172 susceptible cohort, 153 medical undergraduates were followed up. 47 students reported VZV infection during the follow up period and 43 of them participated in the study. The cumulative incidence of VZV infection during the period of five and half years of medical training was 30.7%. Incidence density of VZV infection among medical undergraduates in this cohort was 65.1 per 1,000 person years of follow-up. A total of 377 working days were lost by 43 students due to the VZV infection, averaging 8.8 days per undergraduate. Total academic losses for the study cohort were; 205 lectures, 17 practicals, 13 dissection sessions, 11 tutorials, 124 days of clinical training and 107 days of professorial clinical appointments. According to their perception they lost 1,927 study hours due to the illness (Median 50 hours per undergraduate).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VZV infection among Sri Lankan medical undergraduates is very high and the impact of this infection on academic activities causes severe disruption of their undergraduate life. VZV immunization for susceptible new entrant medical undergraduates is recommended.","['Agampodi SB', 'Dharmaratne SD', 'Thevanesam V', 'Dassanayake S', 'Kumarihamy P', 'Ratnayake A']",2010,10,,BMC Infect Dis,"Agampodi SB, et al.

20461528,Hospitalization of newborns and young infants for chickenpox in France.,"Chickenpox is often considered more severe during the first year of life, but its course is usually mild during the first 3 months of life, presumably owing to the persistence of maternal antibodies. Hospitalization and intravenous acyclovir therapy are generally restricted to severe cases but also systematically recommended in newborns in France, irrespective of the clinical severity of the infection. This recommendation was launched in 1998 when Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immunoglobulins were not available in the country and has remained unchanged since. The aim of this prospective observational study was to describe complications of varicella infection in a population of 745 children hospitalized for varicella before 1 year of age, with a specific focus on newborns. Complications occurred in 65% of cases. They were very rare before the age of 1 month (10%) but their incidence then increased progressively with age and probably the disappearance of maternal antibodies: 42% (1-2 months), 66% (3-5 months), 70% (6-8 months), and 79% (9-12 months). Conclusion Chickenpox is usually mild in newborns because most of them are protected by VZV maternal antibodies. Unless the absence of maternal VZV immunity is demonstrated, newborns with mild chickenpox should not require antiviral therapy.","['Lécuyer A', 'Levy C', 'Gaudelus J', 'Floret D', 'Soubeyrand B', 'Caulin E', 'Cohen R', 'Grimprel E', 'Pediatricians Working Group']",2010,169,10,Eur J Pediatr,"Lécuyer A, et al.

METHODS: A retrospective study of all children diagnosed with ITP in a tertiary medical centre during 1998-2008. Findings were compared with the Intercontinental Childhood ITP Study Group database. The risk of acquiring ITP after a varicella infection was assessed.
RESULTS: Ten children were diagnosed with post-varicella ITP. The incidence of post-varicella ITP was 1.9% amongst children diagnosed with ITP and 1.1% amongst children hospitalized for varicella. ITP was diagnosed, on average, 8.5 days after the onset of the varicella rash. The female-to-male ratio was 1:1.5. The average minimal platelet count was 9.5 × 10⁹ platelets/L. Post-varicella ITP had an acute course in 80% of cases and a chronic course in the remaining 20%. Bleeding episodes occurred in three patients. During the follow-up period, 11 patients with previously diagnosed ITP developed varicella. The infection had no apparent affect on the platelet count of the children with acute ITP, but caused a relapse in 71% of the patients with chronic ITP.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-varicella ITP has similar clinical features and course to non-varicella associated ITP.

20448530,"Use of combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).","This report presents new recommendations adopted in June 2009 by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding use of the combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV, ProQuad, Merck & Co., Inc.). MMRV vaccine was licensed in the United States in September 2005 and may be used instead of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR, M-M-RII, Merck & Co., Inc.) and varicella vaccine (VARIVAX, Merck & Co., Inc.) to implement the recommended 2-dose vaccine schedule for prevention of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella among children aged 12 months-12 years. At the time of its licensure, use of MMRV vaccine was preferred for both the first and second doses over separate injections of equivalent component vaccines (MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine), which was consistent with ACIP's 2006 general recommendations on use of combination vaccines (CDC. General recommendations on immunization: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2006;55;[No. RR-15]). Since July 2007, supplies of MMRV vaccine have been temporarily unavailable as a result of manufacturing constraints unrelated to efficacy or safety. MMRV vaccine is expected to be available again in the United States in May 2010. In February 2008, on the basis of preliminary data from two studies conducted postlicensure that suggested an increased risk for febrile seizures 5-12 days after vaccination among children aged 12-23 months who had received the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with children the same age who had received the first dose of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine administered as separate injections at the same visit, ACIP issued updated recommendations regarding MMRV vaccine use (CDC. Update: recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] regarding administration of combination MMRV vaccine. MMWR 2008;57:258-60). These updated recommendations expressed no preference for use of MMRV vaccine over separate injections of equivalent component vaccines for both the first and second doses. The final results of the two postlicensure studies indicated that among children aged 12--23 months, one additional febrile seizure occurred 5-12 days after vaccination per 2,300-2,600 children who had received the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with children who had received the first dose of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine administered as separate injections at the same visit. Data from postlicensure studies do not suggest that children aged 4--6 years who received the second dose of MMRV vaccine had an increased risk for febrile seizures after vaccination compared with children the same age who received MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine administered as separate injections at the same visit. In June 2009, after consideration of the postlicensure data and other evidence, ACIP adopted new recommendations regarding use of MMRV vaccine for the first and second doses and identified a personal or family (i.e., sibling or parent) history of seizure as a precaution for use of MMRV vaccine. For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at age 12--47 months, either MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine or MMRV vaccine may be used. Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination options with the parents or caregivers. Unless the parent or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC recommends that MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine should be administered for the first dose in this age group. For the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at any age (15 months-12 years) and for the first dose at age >or=48 months, use of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine). This recommendation is consistent with ACIP's 2009 provisional general recommendations regarding use of combination vaccines (available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/provisional/downloads/combo-vax-Aug2009-508.pdf), which state that use of a combination vaccine generally is preferred over its equivalent component vaccines.","['Marin M', 'Broder KR', 'Temte JL', 'Snider DE', 'Seward JF', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']",2010,59,RR-3,MMWR Recomm Rep,"Marin M, et al.

20429999,"Changes to the varicella and pertussis immunisation schedule in Germany 2009: background, rationale and implementation.","In July 2009, the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) modified its recommendations for varicella and pertussis vaccination, based on newly available data on disease epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness (VE) and safety, and an evaluation of the feasibility of the recommended immunisation strategy. The recommendation for varicella vaccine now includes a routine two-dose schedule with the administration of the first dose at the age of 11 to 14 months and the second dose at the age of 15 to 23 months, with a minimum interval of four weeks between these doses. Furthermore, STIKO recommended adding a one-time pertussis booster to the adult vaccination schedule to expand the cocoon strategy in place since 2004. The recommendation of a booster vaccination with an acellular pertussis vaccine every 10 years for persons employed in the care of pre-school children and for healthcare personnel in paediatric, gynaecologic and obstetric health facilities was extended to persons employed in schools and in other institutions caring for older children, and to all healthcare personnel. These recommendations were based on available epidemiological data showing an increase in incidence from 7-10 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002-2004 to over 30 by 2007. Moreover, the high burden of pertussis in infants at 94 hospitalised cases per 100,000 infants in 2007 suggested that the previous cocoon strategy was insufficient.","['Wiese-Posselt M', 'Hellenbrand W']",2010,15,16,Euro Surveill,"Wiese-Posselt M and Hellenbrand W.

20420159,[Varricela vaccination policy subsidy evaluation].,"OBJECTIVES: Mitoyo and Kanonji cities in Kagawa prefecture began a varicella vaccination subsidy in April 1, 2007. To evaluate this policy, we studied morbidity and vaccination coverage before and after subsidy went into effect, vaccination efficacy for severity and family nursing burden, and cooperation with the Mitoyo Kanonj medical association and Mitoyo and Kanonji municipalities.
METHODS: Mitoyo and Kanonji implemented a varicella vaccination subsidy for residents under 5-years-old born after April 1, 2002, and having previous varicella infection. We surveyed health checkups for children, for doctor or family members with varicella, and subsidy bills from May 1, 2007, to March 31, 2008.
RESULT: The response rate of family member report was about 60% of doctor, varicella broke out in Decemeber 2007. Health surveys showed that varicella vaccination efficacy was 74% at up to three-years-old, but declined to 63% among those older. Morbidity averaged 5 days duration regardless of vaccination. Subsidy vaccination coverage at 1-year-old rose from 8.0% to 17.2% in Mitoyo and from 13.0% to 28.9% in Kanonji, averaging 17.2% in Mitoyo and 28.9% in Kanonji for these under 5-years-old.
DISCUSSION: Vaccination coverage rose, but remained below the national average. We estimate that 6,867,000 yen in total cost and 455,000 yen in direct medical cost on average are saved by the subsidy.","['Ohkusa Y', 'Sugawara T', 'Mino M', 'Shimauchi Y', 'Ozaki T', 'Kagawa Y', 'Okabe N']",2010,84,2,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Ohkusa Y, et al.

The backbone of the vector was our previously reported vOka-BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) genome. We inserted the transposon Tn7 attachment sequence, LacZalpha-mini-attTn7, into the region between ORF12 and ORF13 to generate a vOka-BAC-Tn genome. The MuV-F expressing cassette was transposed into the vOka-BAC genome at the mini-attTn7 transposition site. MuV-F protein was expressed in recombinant virus, rvOka-F infected cells. In addition, the MuV-F protein was cleaved in the rvOka-F infected cells as in MuV-infected cells. The growth of rvOka-F was similar to that of the original recombinant vOka without the F gene. Thus, we show that Tn7-mediated transposition is an efficient method for introducing a foreign gene expression cassette into the vOka-BAC genome as a live virus vector.","['Somboonthum P', 'Koshizuka T', 'Okamoto S', 'Matsuura M', 'Gomi Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Yamanishi K', 'Mori Y']",2010,402,1,Virology,"Somboonthum P, et al.

20397072,Effects of varicella-zoster virus on cell cycle regulatory pathways.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) grows efficiently in quiescent cells in vivo and in culture, and virus infection activates cell cycle and signaling pathways without cell division. VZV ORFs have been identified that determine the tissue tropism for nondividing skin, T cells, and neurons in SCID-Hu mouse models. The normal cell cycle status of human foreskin fibroblasts was characterized and was dysregulated upon infection by VZV. The expression of cyclins A, B1, and D3 was highly elevated but did not correspond with extensive cellular DNA synthesis. Cell cycle arrest may be due to activation of the DNA damage response during VZV DNA replication. Other host regulatory proteins were induced in infected cells, including p27, p53, and ATM kinase. A possible explanation for the increase in cell cycle regulatory proteins is activation of transcription factors during VZV infection. There is evidence that VZV infection activates transcription factors through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal (transpose these parts of the compound noun) kinase (JNK), which could selectively increase cyclin levels. Some of these perturbed cell functions are essential for VZV replication, such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, and reveal targets for interventions.","['Moffat JF', 'Greenblatt RJ']",2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Moffat JF and Greenblatt RJ.

20397071,Varicella-zoster virus T cell tropism and the pathogenesis of skin infection.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a medically important human alphaherpesvirus that causes varicella and zoster. VZV initiates primary infection by inoculation of the respiratory mucosa. In the course of primary infection, VZV establishes a life-long persistence in sensory ganglia; VZV reactivation from latency may result in zoster in healthy and immunocompromised patients. The VZV genome has at least 70 known or predicted open reading frames (ORFs), but understanding how these gene products function in virulence is difficult because VZV is a highly human-specific pathogen. We have addressed this obstacle by investigating VZV infection of human tissue xenografts in the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model. In studies relevant to the pathogenesis of primary VZV infection, we have examined VZV infection of human T cell (thymus/liver) and skin xenografts. This work supports a new paradigm for VZV pathogenesis in which VZV T cell tropism provides a mechanism for delivering the virus to skin. We have also shown that VZV-infected T cells transfer VZV to neurons in sensory ganglia. The construction of infectious VZV recombinants that have deletions or targeted mutations of viral genes or their promoters and the evaluation of VZV mutants in T cell and skin xenografts has revealed determinants of VZV virulence that are important for T cell and skin tropism in vivo.","['Arvin AM', 'Moffat JF', 'Sommer M', 'Oliver S', 'Che X', 'Vleck S', 'Zerboni L', 'Ku CC']",2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Arvin AM, et al.

20394710,Impact of the routine varicella vaccination programme on varicella epidemiology in Germany.,"Routine varicella vaccination with one dose for children of 11 to 14 months was recommended in Germany in 2004 to reduce disease incidence and severe complications. A country-wide varicella sentinel surveillance system was initiated in 2005 to detect trends of disease frequency and vaccine uptake and to evaluate the vaccination programme. A convenient sample of about 1,000 paediatricians and general practitioners was recruited to report on a monthly basis on varicella cases by age groups seen in their practice, and on varicella vaccine doses administered. Sentinel data from April 2005 to March 2009 show a reduction of 55% of varicella cases in all ages; 63% in the age group 0-4 years and 38% in 5-9-year-olds. The number of vaccine doses per reporting unit in all regions and physician groups increased during the same period. The number of reported cases as well as administered vaccines differed between physician groups and regions with different reimbursement policies. Where reimbursement was settled early and vaccine doses were increasing varicella cases started to decrease early as well. Besides reimbursement policies the availability and vaccination schedules influenced vaccine uptake. Sentinel surveillance provided valid data on trends for varicella associated morbidity, vaccine uptake and the age distribution of cases. The results confirm that following the introduction of routine varicella vaccination, varicella morbidity started to decline in Germany.","['Siedler A', 'Arndt U']",2010,15,13,Euro Surveill,Siedler A and Arndt U.

20380851,Seroprevalence rate after one dose of varicella vaccine in infants.,"SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Live, attenuated varicella vaccine has been used since 1988 in Korea. However, varicella is still prevalent among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, despite a relatively high level of immunization rate up to 80%. A recent report has demonstrated approximately 20% of primary vaccine failure rate after one dose of varicella vaccine using the fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) assay.
METHODS: The seroprevalence rate was determined using the FAMA and ELISA assays in 67 Korean infants following one dose of varicella vaccine. Positive fluorescence at a serum dilution of 1:4 or greater was considered as seropositive.
RESULTS: The median age at vaccination was 12 months and the post-immunization sera were obtained on average 6.3 months (range 6 weeks-12 months) after vaccination. Among the 67 vaccinated infants, 56 (83.6%) were seropositive by FAMA assay while 30 (44.8%) were seropositive by ELISA. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of the seropositive vaccinated infants (n = 56) were significantly lower than the GMTs of 9 individuals with a history of varicella (1:17.0 vs. 1:74.7, P = 0.001). Although there were no significant differences in seropositive rates according to intervals, there was a decreasing trend in the GMTs over time among the 56 seropositive recipients (r(2) = 0.154, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These data can be useful for optimizing the immunization strategy against varicella and should be confirmed by a prospective study including a large number of immunized infants.","['Kim SH', 'Lee HJ', 'Park SE', 'Oh SH', 'Lee SY', 'Choi EH']",2010,61,1,J Infect,"Kim SH, et al.

20372089,Safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated varicella vaccine in VZV-seropositive HIV-infected adults.,"BACKGROUND: Herpes-zoster is common in HIV-infected patients in spite of antiretroviral therapy. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine as a candidate for protecting HIV-infected adults against herpes-zoster.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven HIV-infected and 15 uninfected subjects, 18 to 65 years old, were enrolled. Adverse events were minor and similar in HIV-infected vaccine and placebo recipients. At 12 weeks after the 2(nd) dose of vaccine the magnitude of each measure of VZV CMI increased significantly in healthy controls. In HIV-infected vaccinees, VZV RCF significantly increased and ELISPOT showed a positive trend. None of VZV CMI measures significantly increased in HIV-infected placebo recipients. The immunogenicity of the vaccine did not correlate with the nadir CD4 cells of HIV-infected subjects.
METHODS: HIV-infected adults with CD4 > or = 400 cells/microL and plasma HIV RNA <1,000/mL were randomly assigned to receive two doses of VZV vaccine or placebo 12 weeks apart. HIV-uninfected age-matched controls also received two doses of vaccine. VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was measured at baseline and after vaccination using responder cell frequency (RCF), lymphocyte proliferation, and IFNgamma ELISPOT.
CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of varicella vaccine were safe in HIV-infected subjects with CD4 > or = 400 cells/microL, but were only modestly immunogenic.","['Weinberg A', 'Levin MJ', 'Macgregor RR']",2010,6,4,Hum Vaccin,"Weinberg A, et al.

SVV DNA encodes 69 distinct open reading frames, three of which are duplicated within the viral inverted repeats. The viral genome is coordinately expressed, and immediate early (IE), early, and late genes have been characterized.

We evaluated the effectiveness of this intervention.
METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires collected varicella disease and vaccination information. Students eligible for second-dose VOC were 1-dose vaccine recipients without prior varicella disease. A breakthrough varicella case was defined as a maculopapulovesicular rash in a student with onset >42 days after 1-dose vaccination without other apparent cause. Vaccine effectiveness was evaluated using survival analysis techniques and analyzed by vaccine status (first dose versus second dose). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify statistical interactions and adjust for confounders.
RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 92% (342/370). Of the 286 eligible students, 187 (65%) received a second-dose VOC. The crude attack rate was 9/187 (5%) among second-dose VOC recipients; 43/99 (43%) among 1-dose recipients, and 5/6 (83%) among unvaccinated students. Second-dose VOC recipients had milder rashes, compared with 1-dose or unvaccinated students. The adjusted incremental second-dose vaccine effectiveness was 76% (95% confidence interval: 44%-90%) for students with classroom exposure. Incremental effectiveness was similar (79%) when we extended the immune response time from 4 days to 7 days after second-dose VOC.
CONCLUSIONS: Second-dose VOC resulted in a substantial reduction in varicella incidence for students with classroom exposure. Until high rates of routine second-dose vaccine coverage are achieved, clinicians should consider second-dose VOC an appropriate intervention to reduce disease transmission in institution-based outbreaks.","['Nguyen MD', 'Perella D', 'Watson B', 'Marin M', 'Renwick M', 'Spain CV']",2010,29,8,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Nguyen MD, et al.

We investigated the antiviral effects of additional compounds that target CDKs or other cell cycle enzymes in culture, ex vivo, and in vivo. Cytotoxicity and cell growth arrest doses were determined by Neutral Red assay. Antiviral effects were evaluated in HFFs by plaque assay, genome copy number, and bioluminescence.

20305014,Toxin profiling of Staphylococcus aureus strains involved in varicella superinfection.,"The most common complications of varicella are bacterial skin and soft tissue infections, generally due to Staphylococcus aureus and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. The aim of this study was to characterize the toxin and antibiotic resistance profiles of S. aureus isolates involved in varicella complications. Between 2002 and 2007, the French Reference Centre for Staphylococci collected 58 S. aureus isolates involved in varicella superinfection. All the isolates were characterized by screening for 12 toxin genes, agr typing, and mecA gene detection; some isolates were also studied by spa typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and resistance profiling. A major toxin gene was detected in 53% (31/58) of the isolates (genes for exfoliative toxins A and B, 17.2%; Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene, 8.6%; toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene, 27.6%). Most clinical manifestations were directly compatible with the classical activity of these toxins. Nineteen isolates (33%) were resistant to methicillin, and 12 of these isolates belonged to an emerging agr-2, ST5 clone that harbors the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 gene. These data should be considered in the management and treatment of patients with varicella complicated by S. aureus superinfection. Antibiotics that decrease toxin production, such as clindamycin, may provide benefit, and their efficacy against bacterial superinfections in children with varicella should be studied.","['Raulin O', 'Durand G', 'Gillet Y', 'Bes M', 'Lina G', 'Vandenesch F', 'Floret D', 'Etienne J', 'Laurent F']",2010,48,5,J Clin Microbiol,"Raulin O, et al.

20235203,Safety and immunogenicity of varicella vaccine in patients with juvenile rheumatic diseases receiving methotrexate and corticosteroids.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of varicella vaccine (VV) in susceptible patients with juvenile rheumatic diseases receiving methotrexate and corticosteroids.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients with juvenile rheumatic diseases (ages 2-19 years) and 18 healthy children and adolescents (ages 3-18 years) received a single dose of VV. All 25 patients were receiving methotrexate; 13 were also receiving prednisone and 5 were also receiving other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. None of the vaccinated patients or controls had a previous history of varicella. Anti-varicella-zoster virus IgG antibody (anti-VZV-IgG) titers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immediately before, 4-6 weeks after, and 1 year after vaccination. The patients were monitored prospectively for adverse reactions related to the vaccine, exposure, and occurrence of varicella. Disease activity was assessed 3 months before and 3 months after VV.
RESULTS: Twenty patients and all of the controls had negative preimmunization titers of VZV-IgG, and 5 patients had equivocal levels. Positive VZV-IgG titers were detected in 10 (50%) of 20 seronegative patients and 13 (72.2%) of 18 controls 4-6 weeks after VV (P = 0.2). One year after vaccination, 8 of 10 patients maintained positive VZV-IgG titers. No overt varicella episodes and no severe adverse reactions were observed during the followup period. No worsening of clinical parameters and no flares of juvenile rheumatic diseases or changes in doses of medications used were detected after vaccination. In fact, the number of active joints in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis was significantly lower after VV (P = 0.009).

20232192,Perspectives on vaccines against varicella-zoster virus infections.,"Primary infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) results in varicella which, in populations where immunization is not used, occurs mostly in children. Varicella is a generalized rash illness with systemic features such as fever and malaise. During varicella, VZV becomes latent in sensory ganglia of the individual, and in 70% it remains asymptomatic for their lifetime. The remaining 30% develop reactivation from latency, resulting in herpes zoster (HZ). HZ usually occurs in persons over the age of 50, and is manifested by a painful unilateral rash that usually lasts about 2 weeks and then may be followed by a chronic pain syndrome called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). VZV infections are notoriously more severe in immunocompromised hosts than in healthy individuals. Despite gaps in our understanding of the details of immunity to VZV, successful vaccines have been developed against both varicella and zoster.","['Gershon AA', 'Gershon MD']",2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Gershon AA and Gershon MD.

20229231,VZV molecular epidemiology.,"The molecular epidemiology of varicella zoster virus (VZV) has led to an understanding of virus evolution, spread, and pathogenesis. The availability of over 20 full length genomes has confirmed the existence of at least five virus clades and generated estimates of VZV evolution, with evidence of recombination both past and ongoing. Genotyping by restriction enzyme analysis (REA) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) has proven that the virus causing varicella is identical to that which later reactivates as zoster in an individual. Moreover, these methods have shown that reinfection, which is mostly asymptomatic, may also occur and the second virus may establish latency and reactivate. VZV is the only human herpesvirus that is spread by the respiratory route. Genotyping methods, together with epidemiological data and modeling, have provided insights into global differences in the transmission patterns of this ubiquitous virus.",['Breuer J'],2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Breuer J.

20192714,Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.,"Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) results from reactivation of varicella-zoster virus that has been dormant in the spinal and cranial sensory ganglia following primary infection with varicella (chickenpox), usually during childhood. In developed countries more than 95% of the adult population are seropositive for varicella-zoster virus and are therefore at risk of developing HZ. Reactivation can occur at any age, but it is associated with an age-related decline in cell-mediated immunity and therefore occurs more frequently in older adults. Thus, HZ affects up to 25% of individuals during their lifetime, but approximately 50% of those aged 80 years or more. Whilst the disease is rarely life-threatening, it is associated with a number of acute symptoms such as a vesicular rash and pain. Longer-term complications include visual disturbances and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which is potentially the most troubling problem of all, and is associated with severe itching and allodynia. These can combine to negatively impact the day-to-day functioning and quality of life of the patient. Hospitalization associated with HZ and PHN is frequent in older individuals and a significant cost to healthcare providers. Current management of HZ with antiviral drugs and analgesics produces reasonable results in younger patients, in whom the disease is usually milder, and is effective against acute pain and skin rash. However, it is much less effective against PHN, which occurs more commonly and more severely in older patients. Once PHN has developed, current treatments offer only limited benefit and adverse effects are common. Management is challenging and often unsatisfactory (<50% of patients gain 50% relief of pain). With the older adult population steadily growing in size, the number of patients presenting with HZ is also likely to increase and this will place a greater burden on healthcare systems. Prevention strategies, such as vaccinating those at greatest risk, may offer the best option for the future.",['Johnson RW'],2010,9,3 Suppl,Expert Rev Vaccines,Johnson RW.

20225014,Varicella-zoster virus neurotropism in SCID mouse-human dorsal root ganglia xenografts.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic human alphaherpesvirus and the causative agent of varicella and herpes zoster. VZV reactivation from latency in sensory nerve ganglia is a direct consequence of VZV neurotropism. Investigation of VZV neuropathogenesis by infection of human dorsal root ganglion xenografts in immunocompromised (SCID) mice has provided a novel system in which to examine VZV neurotropism. Experimental infection with recombinant VZV mutants with targeted deletions or mutations of specific genes or regulatory elements provides an opportunity to assess gene candidates that may mediate neurotropism and neurovirulence. The SCID mouse-human DRG xenograft model may aid in the development of clinical strategies in the management of herpes zoster as well as in the development of ""second generation"" neuroattenuated vaccines.","['Zerboni L', 'Reichelt M', 'Arvin A']",2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Zerboni L, et al.

20225011,VZV infection of keratinocytes: production of cell-free infectious virions in vivo.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the cause of varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles). Varicella is a primary infection that spreads rapidly in epidemics while zoster is a secondary infection that occurs sporadically as a result of the reactivation of previously acquired VZV. Reactivation is made possible by the establishment of latency during the initial episode of varicella. The signature lesions of both varicella and zoster are cutaneous vesicles, which are filled with a clear fluid that is rich in infectious viral particles. It has been postulated that the skin is the critical organ in which both host-to-host transmission of VZV and the infection of neurons to establish latency occur. This hypothesis is built on evidence that the large cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR(ci)) interacts with VZV in virtually all infected cells, except those of the suprabasal epidermis, in a way that prevents the release of infectious viral particles. Specifically, the virus is diverted in an MPR(ci)-dependent manner from the secretory pathway to late endosomes where VZV is degraded. Because nonepidermal cells are thus prevented from releasing infectious VZV, a slow process, possibly involving fusion of infected cells with their neighbors, becomes the means by which VZV is disseminated. In the epidermis, however, the maturation of keratinocytes to give rise to corneocytes in the suprabasal epidermis is associated uniquely with a downregulation of the MPR(ci). As a result, the diversion of VZV to late endosomes does not occur in the suprabasal epidermis where vesicular lesions occur. The formation of the waterproof, chemically resistant barrier of the epidermis, however, requires that constitutive secretion outlast the downregulation of the endosomal pathway. Infectious VZV is therefore secreted by default, accounting for the presence of infectious virions in vesicular fluid. Sloughing of corneocytes, aided by scratching, then aerosolizes the virus, which can float with dust to be inhaled by susceptible hosts. Infectious virions also bathe the terminals of those sensory neurons that innervate the epidermis. These terminals become infected with VZV and provide a route, retrograde transport, which can conduct VZV to cranial nerve (CNG), dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and enteric ganglia (EG) to establish latency. Reactivation returns VZV to the skin, now via anterograde transport in axons, to cause the lesions of zoster. Evidence in support of these hypotheses includes observations of the VZV-infected human epidermis and studies of guinea pig neurons in an in vitro model system.","['Gershon MD', 'Gershon AA']",2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Gershon MD and Gershon AA.

20225010,Varicella-zoster virus vaccine: molecular genetics.,"The genetic differences that potentially account for the attenuation of the Oka vaccine VZV preparation are more clearly defined than for perhaps any other vaccine in current use. This is due in large part to the small number of differences between the vaccine and the parental strain from which it was derived, and to the high level of genomic conservation that characterizes VZV. This information has been used with great success to develop methods that discriminate vaccine from wild-type strains, to begin determining which specific vaccine markers contribute to the attenuated phenotype, to improve evaluations of vaccine efficacy and safety, and to observe the behavior of the live, attenuated preparation as it becomes more prevalent through widespread immunization.",['Schmid DS'],2010,342,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Schmid DS.

20223490,Comparison of the Hungarian and Scottish communicable disease control systems: lessons for a convergent European Community.,"BACKGROUND: European public health systems are converging, particularly in relation to communicable disease control. This process requires mutual learning through comparison; this was undertaken for Scotland (population 5.1 million) and Hungary (population 10.5 million).
METHODS: Using the official web- and paper-based publications, the practice of communicable disease control was compared between the two countries in three specific fields: seasonal influenza surveillance; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surveillance; and the childhood vaccination system.
RESULTS: The organization structure for communicable disease control was very similar, comprising of government, national, regional and sub-regional tiers in Hungary, and government, national and local (sub-regional) tiers in Scotland. The influenza surveillance system in both countries was mainly based on the 'fluspotter system'. In the 2005/6, 2006/7 and 2007/8 seasons, there was no exceptional influenza activity in either country. Although the data collection and surveillance system of HIV is similar, there was a massive difference in the number of reported cases. In 2007, the cumulative incidence of reported HIV cases was 14.74/100,000 in Hungary and 105.21/100,000 in Scotland. The routine childhood vaccination schedule is similar in the two countries. However, while the vaccine uptake rates were nearly 100% in Hungary, these rates were lower in Scotland. The numbers of reported pertussis (98 vs 48), mumps (2741 vs 16), rubella (146 vs 0) and measles (168 vs zero) cases were significantly higher in Scotland than in Hungary. There were no differences for polio and chickenpox.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic difference between the two countries not reflected in the efficiency of communicable disease control and in communicable disease patterns. The historical, political and cultural differences seem more determinative in this comparison.","['Stefler D', 'Bhopal R']",2010,124,3,Public Health,Stefler D and Bhopal R.

20218333,[A live attenuated varicella vaccine].,"The vaccine virus was isolated from a vesicle of a 3-year-old otherwise healthy boy called Oka (his family name) who had typical varicella. This virus was passaged through human embryonic lung cells, guinea pig embryonic cells at a low temperature, and human diploid cells (WI-38). It was then adapted to MRC-5 human diploid cells for vaccine preparation. The vaccine contains cell-free virus with a minimum of 1000 plaque forming units per dose and suitable stabilizers. In 1974 the vaccine was administered to hospitalized children immediately after the occurrence of an index varicella case because preventive methods, such as administration of VZV immune globulin, were unavailable at the time. The vaccine prevented the spread of varicella throughout the children's ward of the hospital. Subsequently, the vaccine was shown to be immunogenic, well tolerated, and efficacious even in high-risk children. The vaccine has been studied extensively with largely favorable results. The vaccine was initially licensed in Japan in 1987 for high-risk children but was extended just after licensure to include normal children based on the needs of parents and physicians. Because varicella vaccination is not compulsory in Japan, only approximately 40% of Japanese children received the vaccine in 2008. This low level of coverage was not sufficient to alter the circulation of wild-type VZV, and the epidemiology of natural varicella has not changed since the vaccine was introduced. The most dramatic changes were reported in the USA after the introduction of a universal immunization strategy in 1996, causing vaccine coverage to increase to 89% in 2006. As a result, there have been substantial declines among both children and adults in the incidence of varicella, hospitalizations and ambulatory visits for varicella, mortality due to varicella, varicella-related complications, and overall expenditures for varicella-related illnesses. The vaccine is now commercially available worldwide and was administered to approximately 16 million individuals in approximately 80 countries in 2006. The universal immunization strategy should be introduced in Japan as soon as possible.",['Asano Y'],2009,59,2,Uirusu,Asano Y. [A live attenuated varicella vaccine].

20216242,The effectiveness of varicella vaccine in China.,"BACKGROUND: The attenuated live varicella vaccine had been shown to be effective in preventing varicella and reducing the disease burden in the United States. However, little work has been done on investigating vaccine effectiveness in China where 3 varicella vaccines are available. Although the vaccines contain the same strain of virus, the vaccines licensed in China were from manufacturers different from the one licensed in the United States. We conducted a matched case-control study to assess the effectiveness of the 3 varicella vaccines in use in China.
METHODS: In 2005, we enrolled 1000 cases from Guangzhou, China and 1000 controls matched by age and place of residence. The cases were children clinically diagnosed with acute onset of a diffuse maculopapulovesicular rash without other apparent cause. We interviewed the legal guardians of the participants for demographic information and disease history after obtaining informed consent. We collected information on vaccination status from electronic vaccination records.
RESULTS: The 3 varicella vaccines in China (Varilrix from GlaxoSmithKline, Changchun and Shanghai from Changchun and Shanghai Institutes of Biologic Products, respectively) had similar effectiveness: Varilrix 86.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 72.6, 93.2), Changchun 79.5% (95% CI: 58.1, 90.0), and Shanghai 92.6% (95% CI: 68.9, 98.2). Vaccine effectiveness was higher during the first year after vaccination than during the subsequent 5 years, but the differences did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: The varicella vaccines in China are highly effective in preventing clinical varicella. Further studies on laboratory-confirmed cases are needed to verify the change of vaccine-induced immunity over time.","['Fu C', 'Wang M', 'Liang J', 'Xu J', 'Wang C', 'Bialek S']",2010,29,8,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Fu C, et al.

20201174,Chickenpox: presentation and complications in adults.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical manifestations laboratory findings and frequency of complications in adult chickenpox patients admitted in the hospital.
METHODS: This was a hospital based descriptive study, conducted at the Infectious Diseases Unit, Rashid Hospital Dubai, UAE, from March 2005 to February 2008. The study was designed to include demographics (age, sex, nationality); clinical information, radiological and biochemical changes observed in each patient and data was entered into the proforma separately. Full blood count, urea, electrolytes and blood sugar were done for all the patients, whereas, other tests were carried out when and where it was indicated. Patients were treated according to the standard protocol for the management of Chickenpox and its complications.
RESULTS: A total of 102 adult patients were entered into the study. The main presenting symptoms were itchy skin rash, fever, cough, sputum, breathlessness, throat pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion and headache. Whereas, the most common complications observed were raised Alanine aminotransferases (ALT) levels (51.9%) and the levels were greater than 10-folds of normal value in 4.9%, thrombocytopenia (42.1%), varicella pneumonia (28.4%), skin infection (25.4%), septicaemia (10.7%), Encephalitis/Meningitis (8.8%), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (6.8%), acute renal failure (2.9%) and acute hepatic failure (1.9%). The frequency of varicella pneumonia was noted to be higher in males, older age group (p < .005), smokers (p < .002) and patients with respiratory symptoms (p < .0001). Total five (4.9%) patients expired, whereas, mortality rate was 17.2% in varicella pneumonia patients and 45.5% in mechanically ventilated patients.

20199763,Modeling the impact of one- and two-dose varicella vaccination on the epidemiology of varicella and zoster.,"In many countries, policymakers are being asked to make recommendations regarding the introduction of a 2-dose varicella vaccination program. The objective of this study was to examine the potential impact of 1-dose versus 2-dose varicella vaccination programs on varicella and zoster incidence, using Canada as an example. We developed a deterministic realistic age-structured model that fits 1- and 2-dose vaccine efficacy, varicella force of infection and zoster incidence. Assuming 90% coverage, the base case model (range: min; max) predicts that 1-dose vaccination will reduce varicella and zoster cases by 64% (14%; 96%) and 5% (-2%; 22%), respectively, over 80-years. Adding a second dose is predicted to reduce varicella and zoster by an additional 22% (0%; 82%) and 6% (0%; 14%), respectively. Most varicella cases prevented by the second dose are breakthrough infections. Although the incremental effectiveness of adding the second dose is highly sensitive to vaccine efficacy and mixing, predictions of the overall benefit of a 2-dose program is relatively robust to model assumptions. Adding a 2-dose program may help guarantee high population-level effectiveness against varicella. However, the incremental benefit of a second dose is highly dependant on the effectiveness of the first dose and its impact on zoster.","['Brisson M', 'Melkonyan G', 'Drolet M', 'De Serres G', 'Thibeault R', 'De Wals P']",2010,28,19,Vaccine,"Brisson M, et al.

20190839,"Safety of the live, attenuated varicella vaccine in pediatric recipients of hematopoietic SCTs.","VZV is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among patients after hematopoietic SCT (HSCT). There is controversy surrounding the use of the live attenuated varicella vaccine (LAVV) in this population due to concerns that the immunization may cause VZ-related disease.

We retrospectively examined the incidence of post-immunization complications attributable to the LAVV in pediatric patients after HSCT. We also reported seroconversion rates when possible. Among 68 recipients of the LAVV after HSCT, 3 (4.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.0-12.7%) experienced mild-to-moderate symptoms potentially attributable to vaccination, and there were no severe reactions. Among 28 patients analyzed for seroconversion, 18 (64.3%; 95% CI=45.8-79.4%) seroconverted, 3 (10.7%; 95% CI 2.9-28.0%) possibly seroconverted and 7 (25.0%; 95% CI=12.4-43.6%) failed to seroconvert.

20175899,Outbreak of chickenpox in a refugee camp of northern Thailand.,"Although chickenpox is a generally mild, self-limited illness of children, it can cause fatal disease in adults. Accumulating reports from tropical countries showed a high prevalence of seronegativity among the adults, implying that varicella diseases could become a heavy burden in tropical countries. However, in the situation of humanitarian emergencies in tropical areas, chickenpox has largely been ignored as a serious communicable disease, due to lack of data regarding varicella mortality and hospital admissions in such a context. This is the first report describing an outbreak of chickenpox in a refugee camp of tropical region. In 2008, we experienced a varicella outbreak in ethnic Lao Hmong refugee camp in Phetchabun Province, northern Thailand. The attack rate was 4.0% (309/7,815) and this caused 3 hospitalizations including one who developed severe varicella pneumonia with respiratory failure. All hospitalizations were exclusively seen in adults, and the proportion of patients > or = 15 years old was 13.6% (42/309). Because less exposure to varicella-zoster virus due to low population density has previously been suggested to be one of the reasons behind higher prevalence of susceptible adults in tropics, the influx of displaced people from rural areas to a densely populated asylum might result in many severe adult cases once a varicella outbreak occurs. Control interventions such as vaccination should be considered even in refugee camp, if the confluence of the risk factors present in this situation.","['Shimakawa Y', 'Camélique O', 'Ariyoshi K']",2010,4,,Confl Health,"Shimakawa Y, et al.

20170376,Influence of age and nature of primary infection on varicella-zoster virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immunity is important for protection against VZV disease. We studied the relationship between VZV cell-mediated immunity and age after varicella or VZV vaccination in healthy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals.
METHODS: VZV responder cell frequency (RCF) determinations from 752 healthy and 200 HIV-infected subjects were used to identify group-specific regression curves on age.
RESULTS: In healthy individuals with past varicella, VZV RCF peaked at 34 years of age. Similarly, VZV-RCF after varicella vaccine increased with age in subjects aged <1 to 43 years. In subjects aged 61-90 years, VZV RCF after zoster vaccine decreased with age. HIV-infected children had lower VZV RCF estimates than HIV-infected adults. In both groups, VZV RCF results were low and constant over age. Varicella vaccination of HIV-infected children with CD4 levels 20% generated VZV RCF values higher than wild-type infection and comparable to vaccine-induced responses of healthy children.
CONCLUSIONS: In immunocompetent individuals with prior varicella, VZV RCF peaked in early adulthood. Administration of varicella vaccine to HIV-infected or uninfected individuals aged >5 years generated VZV RCF values similar to those of immunocompetent individuals with immunity induced by wild-type infection. A zoster vaccine increased the VZV RCF of elderly adults aged <75 years to values higher than peak values induced by wild-type infection.","['Weinberg A', 'Lazar AA', 'Zerbe GO', 'Hayward AR', 'Chan IS', 'Vessey R', 'Silber JL', 'MacGregor RR', 'Chan K', 'Gershon AA', 'Levin MJ']",2010,201,7,J Infect Dis,"Weinberg A, et al.

20148263,"Safety, immunogenicity and immediate pain of intramuscular versus subcutaneous administration of a measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine to children aged 11-21 months.","This study compared intramuscular and subcutaneous administration of two doses of measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) combination vaccine (Priorix-Tetra, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) in children. Healthy children (N = 328) were randomised to receive MMRV either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Reactogenicity was similar between treatment groups for immediate vaccination pain, vaccination site pain, redness and incidence of fever and rashes. Slightly less vaccination site swelling occurred during days 0-3 of the post-vaccination period after intramuscular administration. Seroconversion rates for all components, 42-56 days post-dose 2, ranged from 99.3% to 100% in the intramuscular group and from 98.6% to 100% in the subcutaneous. Cell-mediated immunity data supported the humoral immunogenicity findings. In summary, the MMRV vaccine is well tolerated and highly immunogenic when administered either subcutaneously or intramuscularly to children in the second year of life.","['Knuf M', 'Zepp F', 'Meyer CU', 'Habermehl P', 'Maurer L', 'Burow HM', 'Behre U', 'Janssens M', 'Willems P', 'Bisanz H', 'Vetter V', 'Schmidt-Ott R']",2010,169,8,Eur J Pediatr,"Knuf M, et al.

20144451,Establishment of the Ph. Eur. BRP for varicella vaccine batch 1.,"The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monograph for varicella vaccine (live) (0648) requires a vial of an appropriate reference material to be titred in triplicate to validate each assay and the virus concentration of the reference preparation is monitored using a control chart to determine the assay consistency. An international collaborative study involving 9 participants from 7 countries and including both OMCLs and manufacturers was carried out to establish a common reference material for this purpose and establish a Ph. Eur. Biological Reference Preparation. Two candidate reference preparations (X and Y), obtained from 2 different EU manufacturers, were assayed by the participants using their in-house PFU assay methods. Both candidates were found to be suitable for this purpose. Based on logistical considerations, candidate X (4.37 log(10)0 PFU/vial) has been established as BRP batch 1 of varicella vaccine (live) and was adopted at the June 2009 session of the European Pharmacopoeia Commission for immediate use. Candidate Y (3.82 log(10) PFU/vial) will be established as BRP batch 2 upon depletion of BRP batch 1 provided that the stability data supports this.","['Akkermans AM', 'Waeterloos G', 'Kemiha K', 'Daas A', 'Milne C']",2009,2009,1,Pharmeur Bio Sci Notes,"Akkermans AM, et al.

20140315,[Varicella outbreak in a village in Uruguay].,"UNLABELLED: A varicella outbreak occurred in a Uruguayan village that introduced the varicella vaccine in 1999 with currently high vaccination rates.
AIM: To investigate the cause of the outbreak, vaccine effectiveness, and to describe the measures adopted.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cases that occurred in the kindergarten and schools in the village were investigated. Vaccination cards were examined, history of chickenpox and clinical characteristic of the current episode were obtained and the outcome of the measures was evaluated. An estimate was made of the vaccine's effectiveness.
RESULTS: 37 cases of varicella were reported, 14 occurring in previously vaccinated children, in a one total population of 313 children. The global effectiveness of the vaccine was 80%, and 100% for severe cases. A shift of cases towards older ages was demonstrated; vaccinated children had a trend of less fever and lower number of lesions. Immunization of healthy unvaccinated children, mainly adolescents stopped the outbreak.
COMMENTS: The vaccine proved to be highly effectiveness. In an outbreak situation, immunization policies should consider ""catch up"" vaccination in non-immunized adolescents without a previous history of varicella.","['Quian R J', 'Protasio P A', ""Dall'orso V P"", 'Mas G M', 'Romero O C', 'Ferreira J N', 'Coria R I']",2010,27,1,Rev Chilena Infectol,"Quian R J, et al.

20138690,Peripheral facial palsy after varicella. Report of two cases and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: There is little information regarding peripheral facial palsy (PFP) as a complication of varicella. We describe 2 adults who developed varicella-related PFP, in 1 case as a part of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and review all reported cases of this condition.
METHODS: MEDLINE search.
RESULTS: A total of 10 cases of isolated varicella-associated PFP have been reported. PFP was diagnosed 3 to 16 days after the onset of skin manifestations. Four (40%) patients developed bilateral PFP. Two patients had varicella meningitis; both were PCR-positive for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in CSF. CSF IgG antibodies against VZV were demonstrated in 2 other patients. One patient had slight CSF albumino-cytological dissociation. Five patients were treated with acyclovir, and 3 of them also received corticosteroids. Most patients showed a favorable course, with partial or complete recovery of PFP. In addition, 17 patients with GBS after the onset of varicella were reviewed. Mean time to the development of GBS after varicella onset was 9.3 days, and 9 patients had PFP as a part of the neurologic picture. Seven patients (41%) developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, and all of them showed optimal evolution. One patient died.
CONCLUSIONS: Isolated PFP and GBS are rare peripheral nerve complications after varicella. Treatment should be individualized for each case, depending on the severity of the condition and the clinical evolution.","['Muñoz-Sellart M', 'García-Vidal C', 'Martínez-Yelamos S', 'Niubó J', 'Fernández-Viladrich P']",2010,28,8,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,"Muñoz-Sellart M, et al.

20130046,Impact of varicella-zoster virus on dendritic cell subsets in human skin during natural infection.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella and herpes zoster, diseases characterized by distinct cutaneous rashes. Dendritic cells (DC) are essential for inducing antiviral immune responses; however, the contribution of DC subsets to immune control during natural cutaneous VZV infection has not been investigated. Immunostaining showed that compared to normal skin, the proportion of cells expressing DC-SIGN (a dermal DC marker) or DC-LAMP and CD83 (mature DC markers) were not significantly altered in infected skin. In contrast, the frequency of Langerhans cells was significantly decreased in VZV-infected skin, whereas there was an influx of plasmacytoid DC, a potent secretor of type I interferon (IFN). Langerhans cells and plasmacytoid DC in infected skin were closely associated with VZV antigen-positive cells, and some Langerhans cells and plasmacytoid DC were VZV antigen positive. To extend these in vivo observations, both plasmacytoid DC (PDC) isolated from human blood and Langerhans cells derived from MUTZ-3 cells were shown to be permissive to VZV infection. In VZV-infected PDC cultures, significant induction of alpha IFN (IFN-alpha) did not occur, indicating the VZV inhibits the capacity of PDC to induce expression of this host defense cytokine. This study defines changes in the response of DC which occur during cutaneous VZV infection and implicates infection of DC subtypes in VZV pathogenesis.","['Huch JH', 'Cunningham AL', 'Arvin AM', 'Nasr N', 'Santegoets SJ', 'Slobedman E', 'Slobedman B', 'Abendroth A']",2010,84,8,J Virol,"Huch JH, et al.

20120946,Seroprevalence of varicella-zoster virus in Polish population.,"A varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the first herpesvirus for which a vaccine was developed. Since 1999, the varicella vaccine is licensed in Poland and recommended for use in adults without history of a varicella infection, and in children and young adults with remission of acute leukemia. While serological data is essential to assess the appropriate vaccination programme, we conducted the first in Poland serosurvey on a representative group of Polish population aged 1-19. Serum samples were selected from a serum bank collected in 1995-2004 with a catchment area of the all geographical regions of Poland. A total of 1300 serum samples collected over 9 years (1995-1996, 1998-2004) were selected using a stratified sampling design (stratification by age). Samples were selected, consisting of 100 samples for each 1-year band of age groups 0-9 years, and 40 samples for each 1-year band of age groups 10-19 years. IgG serum antibodies specific to VZV were detected using an indirect enzyme immunoassay and the antibody level was expressed in international units per millilitre (mIU/ml) and was refered to the international standard for VZV immunoglobulin of 50 IU. The overall seroprevalence estimate, adjusted for sampling design for the age group 1-19 was 76.6% (95% CI: 74.6%-78.7%). Seroprevalence correlated closely with age (p<0.0001) and among 18 and 19 year olds reached 95% and 98% respectively. No association was found between gender, rural/urban areas and geographical regions of Poland. For samples collected over the 5 year period (2000-2004), evidence of overall differences in seropositivity over these years was not observed. In Poland VZV vaccination is provided only for a limited group of high risk patients. The possible updates in the immunization program are discussed and the results of the presented study can contribute valuable information to base the vaccination policy decisions.","['Siennicka J', 'Trzcińska A', 'Rosińska M', 'Litwińska B']",2009,63,4,Przegl Epidemiol,"Siennicka J, et al.

20117140,Rapid automation of a cell-based assay using a modular approach: case study of a flow-based Varicella Zoster Virus infectivity assay.,"Vaccine manufacturing requires constant analytical monitoring to ensure reliable quality and a consistent safety profile of the final product. Concentration and bioactivity of active components of the vaccine are key attributes routinely evaluated throughout the manufacturing cycle and for product release and dosage. In the case of live attenuated virus vaccines, bioactivity is traditionally measured in vitro by infection of susceptible cells with the vaccine followed by quantification of virus replication, cytopathology or expression of viral markers. These assays are typically multi-day procedures that require trained technicians and constant attention. Considering the need for high volumes of testing, automation and streamlining of these assays is highly desirable. In this study, the automation and streamlining of a complex infectivity assay for Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) containing test articles is presented. The automation procedure was completed using existing liquid handling infrastructure in a modular fashion, limiting custom-designed elements to a minimum to facilitate transposition. In addition, cellular senescence data provided an optimal population doubling range for long term, reliable assay operation at high throughput. The results presented in this study demonstrate a successful automation paradigm resulting in an eightfold increase in throughput while maintaining assay performance characteristics comparable to the original assay.","['Joelsson D', 'Gates IV', 'Pacchione D', 'Wang CJ', 'Bennett PS', 'Zhang Y', 'McMackin J', 'Frey T', 'Brodbeck KC', 'Baxter H', 'Barmat SL', 'Benetti L', 'Bodmer JL']",2010,166,01월 02일,J Virol Methods,"Joelsson D, et al.
