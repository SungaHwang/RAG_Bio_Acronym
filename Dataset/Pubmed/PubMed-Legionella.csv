37670282,"Empirical antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia and accuracy for Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Clamydophila pneumoniae: a descriptive cross-sectional study of adult patients in the emergency department.","BACKGROUND: Many factors determine empirical antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to describe the empirical antibiotic treatment CAP patients with an acute hospital visit and to determine if the current treatment algorithm provided specific and sufficient coverage against Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Clamydophila pneumoniae (LMC).
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional, multicenter study of all adults with an acute hospital visit in the Region of Southern Denmark between January 2016 and March 2018 was performed. Using medical records, we retrospectively identified the empirical antibiotic treatment and the microbiological etiology for CAP patients. CAP patients who were prescribed antibiotics within 24 h of admission and with an identified bacterial pathogen were included. The prescribed empirical antibiotic treatment and its ability to provide specific and sufficient coverage against LMC pneumonia were determined.
RESULTS: Of the 19,133 patients diagnosed with CAP, 1590 (8.3%) patients were included in this study. Piperacillin-tazobactam and Beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins were the most commonly prescribed empirical treatments, 515 (32%) and 388 (24%), respectively. Our analysis showed that 42 (37%, 95% CI: 28-47%) of 113 patients with LMC pneumonia were prescribed antibiotics with LMC coverage, and 42 (12%, 95% CI: 8-15%) of 364 patients prescribed antibiotics with LMC coverage had LMC pneumonia.
CONCLUSION: Piperacillin-tazobactam, a broad-spectrum antibiotic recommended for uncertain infectious focus, was the most frequent CAP treatment and prescribed to every third patient. In addition, the current empirical antibiotic treatment accuracy was low for LMC pneumonia. Therefore, future research should focus on faster diagnostic tools for identifying the infection focus and precise microbiological testing.","['Lorentzen MH', 'Rosenvinge FS', 'Lassen AT', 'Graumann O', 'Laursen CB', 'Mogensen CB', 'Skjøt-Arkil H']",2023,23,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Lorentzen MH, et al.

37653467,Proteomic analysis of Acanthamoeba castellanii response to Legionella pneumophila infection.,"Legionella pneumophila is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for Legionnaires' disease or Legionellosis. This bacterium is found in the environment interacting with free-living amoebae such as Acanthamoeba castellanii. Until now, proteomic analyses have been done in amoebae infected with L. pneumophila but focused on the Legionella-containing vacuole. In this study, we propose a global proteomic analysis of the A. castellanii proteome following infection with L. pneumophila wild-type (WT) or with an isogenic ΔdotA mutant strain, which is unable to replicate intracellularly. We found that infection with L. pneumophila WT leads to reduced levels of A. castellanii proteins associated with lipid homeostasis/metabolism, GTPase regulation and kinase. The levels of organelle-associated proteins were also decreased during infection. L. pneumophila WT infection leads to increase levels of proteins associated with proteins polyubiquitination, folding or degradation and antioxidant activities. This study reinforces our knowledge of this too-little-explored but so fundamental interaction between L. pneumophila and A. castellanii, to understand how the bacterium could resist amoeba digestion.","['Hay A', 'Rolland S', 'Bernard C', 'Hechard Y', 'Villeger R', 'Samba-Louaka A']",2023,,,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Hay A, et al.

37652687,"Trends of legionellosis reported in Jeju Province, Republic of Korea, 2015-2022.","BACKGROUND: The number of reported cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD) in the Republic of Korea surged nationally in 2016; however, in 2022, this number was higher in Jeju Province than the previous national peak. A descriptive epidemiological study was conducted to analyze trends in the incidence of reported LD cases in Jeju Island from 2015 to 2022.
METHODS: The data for this study were obtained from case reports submitted to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency through its Disease and Health Integrated Management System. The selection criteria were cases or suspected cases of LD reported among Jeju residents between 2015 and 2022. The 95% confidence interval of the crude incidence rate was calculated using the Poisson distribution.
RESULTS: Since 2020, the incidence rate of LD in Jeju has risen sharply, showing a statistically significant difference from the national incidence rate. A particular medical institution in Jeju reported a significant number of LD cases. Screening with the urine antigen test (UAT) also increased significantly.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the rapid increase in cases of LD in Jeju Province since 2020 was due to the characteristics of medical-care use among Jeju residents, which were focused on a specific medical institution. According to their clinical practice guidelines, this medical institution conducted UATs to screen patients suspected of pneumonia.","['Park J', 'Bae JM']",2023,14,4,Osong Public Health Res Perspect,"Park J and Bae JM.

In recent years, CRISPR-Cas12a has shown great potential in improving the performance of DNA biosensing. However, the nonspecific trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a complicates the multiplexing capability of Cas12a biosensing. We report a 3D-printed composable microfluidic plate (cPlate) device that utilizes miniaturized wells and microfluidic loading for a multiplexed CRISPR-Cas12a assay. The device easily combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and CRISPR-Cas12a readout in a simple and high-throughput workflow with low reagent consumption. To ensure the maximum performance of the device, the concentration of Cas12a and detection probe was optimized, which yielded a four-fold sensitivity improvement.

37633566,Legionella pneumophila macrophage infectivity potentiator protein appendage domains modulate protein dynamics and inhibitor binding.,"Macrophage infectivity potentiator (MIP) proteins are widespread in human pathogens including Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease and protozoans such as Trypanosoma cruzi. All MIP proteins contain a FKBP (FK506 binding protein)-like prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase domain that hence presents an attractive drug target. Some MIPs such as the Legionella pneumophila protein (LpMIP) have additional appendage domains of mostly unknown function. In full-length, homodimeric LpMIP, the N-terminal dimerization domain is linked to the FKBP-like domain via a long, free-standing stalk helix. Combining X-ray crystallography, NMR and EPR spectroscopy and SAXS, we elucidated the importance of the stalk helix for protein dynamics and inhibitor binding to the FKBP-like domain and bidirectional crosstalk between the different protein regions. The first comparison of a microbial MIP and a human FKBP in complex with the same synthetic inhibitor was made possible by high-resolution structures of LpMIP with a [4.3.1]-aza-bicyclic sulfonamide and provides a basis for designing pathogen-selective inhibitors. Through stereospecific methylation, the affinity of inhibitors to L. pneumophila and T. cruzi MIP was greatly improved. The resulting X-ray inhibitor-complex structures of LpMIP and TcMIP at 1.49 and 1.34 Å, respectively, provide a starting point for developing potent inhibitors against MIPs from multiple pathogenic microorganisms.","['Wiedemann C', 'Whittaker JJ', 'Pérez Carrillo VH', 'Goretzki B', 'Dajka M', 'Tebbe F', 'Harder JM', 'Krajczy PR', 'Joseph B', 'Hausch F', 'Guskov A', 'Hellmich UA']",2023,252,,Int J Biol Macromol,"Wiedemann C, et al.

37633274,"The respiratory tract microbiome, the pathogen load, and clinical interventions define severity of bacterial pneumonia.","Bacterial pneumonia is a considerable problem worldwide. Here, we follow the inter-kingdom respiratory tract microbiome (RTM) of a unique cohort of 38 hospitalized patients (n = 97 samples) with pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. The RTM composition is characterized by diversity drops early in hospitalization and ecological species replacement. RTMs with the highest bacterial and fungal loads show low diversity and pathogen enrichment, suggesting high biomass as a biomarker for secondary and/or co-infections. The RTM structure is defined by a ""commensal"" cluster associated with a healthy RTM and a ""pathogen"" enriched one, suggesting that the cluster equilibrium drives the microbiome to recovery or dysbiosis. Legionella biomass correlates with disease severity and co-morbidities, while clinical interventions influence the RTM dynamics. Fungi, archaea, and protozoa seem to contribute to progress of pneumonia. Thus, the interplay of the RTM equilibrium, the pathogen load dynamics, and clinical interventions play a critical role in patient recovery.","['Pérez-Cobas AE', 'Ginevra C', 'Rusniok C', 'Jarraud S', 'Buchrieser C']",2023,,,Cell Rep Med,"Pérez-Cobas AE, et al.

37544110,Assessing the health risks associated with the usage of water-atomization shower systems in buildings.,"In the context of climate change policies, buildings must implement solutions to reduce energy and water consumption. One such solution is showering with water atomization showerheads, which can significantly reduce water and energy usage. However, the lack of risk assessment for users' health has hindered the widespread adoption of this technology. To address this gap, we assess the risk of spreading bacteria, in particular the pathogenic bacterium Legionella pneumophila, from shower hose biofilms of different ages grown under controlled or uncontrolled conditions considering different levels of water hardness, during showering using water atomization showerheads (ECO) or continuous flow showerheads (STA). We compared the aerosol and bioaerosol emission - total, viable and cultivable - during a 10 min shower event between the two shower systems. We showed that the water-atomization showerhead emitted slightly more nanoparticles smaller than 0.45 µm and slightly fewer particles larger than 0.5 µm than the continuous flow showerhead. Additionally, ECO showerheads emitted fewer cultivable bacteria than STA, regardless of the biofilm's age or growth conditions.

37518067,Sodium levels and grazing pressure shape natural communities of the intracellular pathogen Legionella.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella are parasites of freshwater protozoa, responsible for Legionellosis. Legionella can be found in a variety of aquatic environments, including rivers, lakes, and springs, as well as in engineered water systems where they can potentially lead to human disease outbarks. Legionella are considered to be predominantly freshwater organisms with a limited ability to proliferate in saline environments. Exposure of Legionella to high sodium concentrations inhibits growth and virulence of laboratory strains, particularly under elevated temperatures. Nonetheless, Legionella have been identified in some saline environments where they likely interact with various protozoan hosts. In this work, we examine how these selection pressures, sodium and grazing, help shape Legionella ecology within natural environments. Utilizing Legionella-specific primers targeting a variable region of the Legionella 16S rRNA gene, we characterized Legionella abundance, diversity, and community composition in natural spring clusters of varying sodium concentrations, focusing on high sodium concentrations and elevated temperatures.
RESULTS: We observed the highest abundance of Legionella in spring clusters of high salinity, particularly in combination with elevated temperatures. Legionella abundance was strongly related to sodium concentrations. The Legionella community structure in saline environments was characterized by relatively low diversity, compared to spring clusters of lower salinity. The community composition in high salinity was characterized by few dominant Legionella genotypes, not related to previously described species. Protozoan microbial community structure and composition patterns resembled those of Legionella, suggesting a common response to similar selection pressures. We examined Legionella co-occurrence with potential protozoan hosts and found associations with Ciliophora and Amoebozoa representatives.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that selection forces in saline environments favor a small yet dominant group of Legionella species that are not closely related to known species. These novel environmental genotypes interact with various protozoan hosts, under environmental conditions of high salinity. Our findings suggest that alternative survival mechanisms are utilized by these species, representing mechanisms distinct from those of well-studied laboratory strains. Our study demonstrate how salinity can shape communities of opportunistic pathogens and their hosts, in natural environments, shedding light on evolutionary forces acting within these complex environments.

37515560,Legionella in drinking water: the detection method matters.,"Legionella concentrations in drinking water have been regulated for decades and are evaluated with regard to their concentrations in drinking water plumbing systems (DWPS). The respective action levels differ at the international level. In Germany, the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) specifies the application of ISO 11731 for the detection of legionella in drinking water and gives a binding recommendation for the methods to be used for culturing and evaluation. Effective from 01 March 2019, the UBA recommendation was revised. The utilized culture media in the culture approach were altered, consequently affecting the spectrum of legionella colonies detected in drinking water. Using data from a routine legionella monitoring of a large laboratory, over a period of 6 years and 17,270 individual drinking water samples, allowed us to assess the impact of the alteration on the assessment of DWPS. By comparing the amount of action level exceedances before and after the method change, it could be demonstrated that exceedances are reported significantly more often under the new method. Consequently, the corresponding action level for evaluation of legionella contamination and the resulting risk to human health needs to be revised to avoid the misleading impression of increased health risk.","['Zacharias N', 'Waßer F', 'Freier L', 'Spies K', 'Koch C', 'Pleischl S', 'Mutters NT', 'Kistemann T']",2023,21,7,J Water Health,"Zacharias N, et al.

37505660,Legionnaires' Disease in Occupational Settings: A Cross-Sectional Study from Northeastern Italy (2019).,"In Italy, Legionnaires' Disease (LD) causes >1000 hospital admissions per year, with a lethality rate of 5 to 10%. Occupational exposures could reasonably explain a substantial share of total cases, but the role of Occupational Physicians (OPs) in management and prevention of LD has been scarcely investigated. The present survey therefore evaluates the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding LD from a convenience sample of Italian OPs, focusing on their participation in preventive interventions. A total of 165 OPs were recruited through a training event (Parma, Northeastern Italy, 2019), and completed a specifically designed structured questionnaire. The association between reported participation in preventive interventions and individual factors was analyzed using a binary logistic regression model, calculating corresponding multivariable Odds Ratio (aOR). Overall, participants exhibited satisfactory knowledge of the clinical and diagnostic aspects of LD, while substantial uncertainties were associated epidemiological factors (i.e., notification rate and lethality). Although the majority of participating OPs reportedly assisted at least one hospital (26.7%) and/or a nursing home (42.4%) and/or a wastewater treatment plant, only 41.8% reportedly contributed to the risk assessment for LD and 18.8% promoted specifically designed preventive measures. Working as OPs in nursing homes (aOR 8.732; 95% Confidence Intervals [95%CI] 2.991 to 25.487) and wastewater treatment plants (aOR 8.710; 95%CI 2.844 to 26.668) was associated with participation in the risk assessment for LD, while the promotion of preventive practice was associated with working as an OP in hospitals (aOR 6.792; 95%CI 2.026 to 22.764) and wastewater treatment plants (aOR 4.464, 95%CI 1.363 to 14.619). In other words, the effective participation of the OP in the implementation of preventive measures appears uncommon and is limited to certain occupational settings. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of tailoring specifically designed information campaigns aimed to raise the involvement of OPs in the prevention of LD in occupational settings other than healthcare.","['Riccò M', 'Ferraro P', 'Ranzieri S', 'Boldini G', 'Zanella I', 'Marchesi F']",2023,8,7,Trop Med Infect Dis,"Riccò M, et al.

While legionellosis is the leading cause of waterborne outbreaks in the US, most cases are sporadic and acquired in community settings where the environmental source is never identified. This scoping review aimed to summarise the drivers of infections in the USA and determine the magnitude of impact each potential driver may have. A total of 1,738 titles were screened, and 18 articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Strong evidence was found for precipitation as a major driver, and both temperature and relative humidity were found to be moderate drivers of incidence. Increased testing and improved diagnostic methods were classified as moderate drivers, and the ageing U.S. population was a minor driver of increasing incidence. Racial and socioeconomic inequities and water and housing infrastructure were found to be potential factors explaining the increasing incidence though they were largely understudied in the context of non-outbreak cases. Understanding the complex relationships between environmental, infrastructure, and population factors driving legionellosis incidence is important to optimise mitigation strategies and public policy.","['Moffa MA', 'Rock C', 'Galiatsatos P', 'Gamage SD', 'Schwab KJ', 'Exum NG']",2023,151,,Epidemiol Infect,"Moffa MA, et al.

In this work, we test our library of >1000 FKBP-focused ligands for inhibition of LpMip. The [4.3.1]-bicyclic sulfonamide turned out as a highly preferred scaffold and provided the most potent LpMip inhibitors known so far. Selected compounds were non-toxic to human cells, displayed antibacterial activity and block bacterial proliferation in cellular infection-assays as well as infectivity in human lung tissue explants.

37471226,Phosphoribosyl-linked serine ubiquitination of USP14 by the SidE family effectors of Legionella excludes p62 from the bacterial phagosome.,"Xenophagy is an evolutionarily conserved host defensive mechanism to eliminate invading microorganisms through autophagic machinery. The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila can avoid clearance by the xenophagy pathway via the actions of multiple Dot/Icm effector proteins. Previous studies have shown that p62, an adaptor protein involved in xenophagy signaling, is excluded from Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCVs). Such defects are attributed to the multifunctional SidE family effectors (SidEs) that exhibit classic deubiquitinase (DUB) and phosphoribosyl ubiquitination (PR-ubiquitination) activities, yet the mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that the host DUB USP14 is PR-ubiquitinated by SidEs at multiple serine residues, which impairs its DUB activity and its interactions with p62. The exclusion of p62 from the bacterial phagosome requires the ubiquitin ligase but not the DUB activity of SidEs. These results reveal that PR-ubiquitination of USP14 by SidEs contributes to the evasion of xenophagic clearance by L. pneumophila.","['Ge J', 'Wang Y', 'Chen X', 'Yu K', 'Luo ZQ', 'Liu X', 'Qiu J']",2023,42,8,Cell Rep,"Ge J, et al.

37463171,Membrane-dependent actin polymerization mediated by the Legionella pneumophila effector protein MavH.,"L. pneumophila propagates in eukaryotic cells within a specialized niche, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). The infection process is controlled by over 330 effector proteins delivered through the type IV secretion system. In this study, we report that the Legionella MavH effector localizes to endosomes and remodels host actin cytoskeleton in a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) dependent manner when ectopically expressed. We show that MavH recruits host actin capping protein (CP) and actin to the endosome via its CP-interacting (CPI) motif and WH2-like actin-binding domain, respectively. In vitro assays revealed that MavH stimulates actin assembly on PI(3)P-containing liposomes causing their tubulation. In addition, the recruitment of CP by MavH negatively regulates F-actin density at the membrane. We further show that, in L. pneumophila-infected cells, MavH appears around the LCV at the very early stage of infection and facilitates bacterium entry into the host. Together, our results reveal a novel mechanism of membrane tubulation induced by membrane-dependent actin polymerization catalyzed by MavH that contributes to the early stage of L. pneumophila infection by regulating host actin dynamics.","['Zhang Q', 'Wan M', 'Kudryashova E', 'Kudryashov DS', 'Mao Y']",2023,19,7,PLoS Pathog,"Zhang Q, et al.

37462800,Benign acute children myositis: 5 years experience in a tertiary care pediatric hospital.,"Benign acute childhood myositis (BACM) is a self-limited childhood illness, and viral infections mainly cause it. Clinical and laboratory alterations usually normalize rapidly; generally, the only medical intervention required is supportive (hydration and analgesic medication). The low awareness about BACM often led to delayed diagnosis and unneeded ancillary investigations. This study aims to better characterize the clinical and laboratory features of BACM to improve the diagnostic process and inpatient and outpatient management. We conducted a retrospective study selecting all children admitted to Meyer's Children's Hospital-IRCCS (Florence, Italy) with a diagnosis of BACM over the last 5 years, both those visited at Emergency Department (ED) and those admitted to the Pediatric Unit. Clinical, laboratory, and instrumental data were collected from electronic clinical records and analyzed. Overall, sixty-five patients were enrolled; 49 children were visited and discharged directly from ED, whereas 16 were admitted in the Pediatric or Neurologic Wards. The median age was 6.56 years (IQR 4.9-9.1). Male gender (66.1%) and Caucasian ethnicity (70%) were prevalent. Most patients were admitted during winter, and a second peak was found in autumn. All patients had bilateral calf pain, most of them (87.7%) associated with asthenia and refuse to walk (93.8%). Prodromal symptoms were fever (75.3%), cough (32.3%), coryza (26.1%), sore throat (26.1%), and vomiting (15.3%). The median value of CPK was 1827 U/L (IQR 915.5-2462) at peak. CPK median time to normalization was 7 days (IQR 7-8.5) from the nadir. Influenza B was the virus most frequently BACM associated, followed by Influenza A; a novel association with Sars-CoV-2 has been detected. Two patients had pathogenic variants at the Next Generation Sequencing myopathies panel.    Conclusion: School-aged children admitted to the hospital with walking difficulty and myalgia, generally after an upper respiratory tract infection with a moderate CPK elevation, should remind at first of BACM. Rapid complaint resolution and biochemical markers normalization will prevent unnecessary tests and inappropriate therapies. What is Known: • BACM is a self-limited syndrome associated with acute infections. Influenza A and B viruses are the main etiological agents, but BACM may be related to many other microorganisms like Parainfluenza virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Human herpesvirus 6, Respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackieviruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Legionella, and Salmonella spp. • Clinical and laboratory alterations usually normalize rapidly; generally, the only medical intervention required is supportive (hydration, analgesic medication). Evolution in rhabdomyolysis and kidney damage is possible but rarely reported. What is New: • Sars-CoV-2 could be an emerging possible cause of BACM. During and after the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak, virus infection seasonality has changed, and so has BACM seasonality. • Screening tests for muscular and metabolic disorders are recommended in recurrent myositis and/or cases with marked CPK elevation (≥ 5000 U/L).","['Attaianese F', 'Costantino A', 'Benucci C', 'Lasagni D', 'Trapani S']",2023,,,Eur J Pediatr,"Attaianese F, et al.

37429596,Tapping lipid droplets: A rich fat diet of intracellular bacterial pathogens.,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic and versatile organelles present in most eukaryotic cells. LDs consist of a hydrophobic core of neutral lipids, a phospholipid monolayer coat, and a variety of associated proteins. LDs are formed at the endoplasmic reticulum and have diverse roles in lipid storage, energy metabolism, membrane trafficking, and cellular signaling. In addition to their physiological cellular functions, LDs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including metabolic disorders, cancer, and infections. A number of intracellular bacterial pathogens modulate and/or interact with LDs during host cell infection. Members of the genera Mycobacterium, Legionella, Coxiella, Chlamydia, and Salmonella exploit LDs as a source of intracellular nutrients and membrane components to establish their distinct intracellular replicative niches. In this review, we focus on the biogenesis, interactions, and functions of LDs, as well as on their role in lipid metabolism of intracellular bacterial pathogens.","['Hüsler D', 'Stauffer P', 'Hilbi H']",2023,120,2,Mol Microbiol,"Hüsler D, et al.

37423969,Pathogen spectrum of community acquired pneumonia in people living with HIV (PLWH) in the German CAPNETZ-Cohort.,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the pathogen spectrum of community acquired pneumonia in people living with HIV (PLWH), and to compare it with a matched HIV negative group in order to reassess therapeutic strategies for PLWH.
METHODS: Seventy-three (n = 73) PLWH (median CD4 3-6 months before CAP: 515/µl; SD 309) with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) were matched with 218 HIV-negative CAP controls in a prospective study design. Pathogen identifications used blood culture, samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract (culture and multiplex PCR) and urinary pneumococcal and legionella antigen test.
RESULTS: Although the vaccination rate among PLWH with CAP was significantly higher (pneumococcal vaccination: 27.4 vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001; influenza vaccination: 34.2 vs. 17.4%, p = 0.009), pneumococci were found most frequently as pathogen among both PLWH (n = 19/21.3%) and controls (n = 34/17.2%; p = 0.410), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (PLWH, n = 12/13.5%, vs. controls, n = 25 / 12.6%; p = 0.850). Staphylococcus aureus was found equally in 20.2 and 19.2% in PLWH and controls, but infection or colonization could not be distinguished. Mortality during 6-month follow-up was significantly higher for PLWH (5/73, or 6.8%) versus controls (3/218, or 1.4%), however with lower case numbers than previously reported. Typical HIV-associated pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii were found only exceptionally.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the persistent clinical burden of CAP for PLWH. From pathogen perspective, empirical antibiotic treatment for CAP in PLWH on antiretroviral therapy should cover pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae and may be adopted from valid common recommendations.","['Schleenvoigt BT', 'Ankert J', 'Barten-Neiner G', 'Voit F', 'Suttorp N', 'Boesecke C', 'Hoffmann C', 'Stolz D', 'Pletz MW', 'Rohde G', 'Witzenrath M', 'Panning M', 'Essig A', 'Rupp J', 'Degen O', 'Stephan C', 'CAPNETZ Study Group']",2023,,,Infection,"Schleenvoigt BT, et al.

37396377,"Could oral hygiene prevent cases of at-home-acquired Legionnaires' disease? - Results of a comprehensive case-control study on infection sources, risk, and protective behaviors.","INTRODUCTION: The ""LeTriWa study"" on community-acquired cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD) found that most cases likely acquired their infection at home (AHALD). However, which sources confer the infection is largely unknown. We therefore analyzed the data set from the LeTriWa study to find out if individual sources were associated with AHALD and if specific behavioral habits may increase or lower the risk for AHALD.
METHODS: During the study we had used two comparison groups: (i) controls matched for age group and hospital (""controls""), (ii) household members of cases with AHALD (""AHALD-HHM""). We inquired about exposure to water sources, such as showering or wearing dentures, as well as behavioral factors and habits related to oral hygiene. We took standardized household bathroom water and biofilm samples of both cases with AHALD and controls, and in addition from households of cases with AHALD only samples from suspect residential (non-)drinking water sources. We first conducted bivariate analyses for infection sources and behaviors, followed by multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: There were 124 cases with AHALD, 217 controls and 59 AHALD-HHM. In bivariate analyses using controls for comparison, wearing dentures was the only variable significantly positively associated (odds ratio (OR) = 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-2.7, 
DISCUSSION: Wearing (inadequately cleaned) dentures or poor oral hygiene might confer an increased risk for AHALD, and oral hygiene may prevent AHALD.

37380986,Identifying the function of genes involved in excreted vesicle formation in Acanthamoeba castellanii containing Legionella pneumophila.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella spp. can survive and replicate inside host cells such as protozoa and macrophages. After enough growth, Legionella is released from the host cells as free legionellae or Legionella-filled vesicles. The vesicles support Legionella to survive for a long time in the environment and transmit to a new host. In this study, we identified the differentially expressed genes of Acanthamoeba infected by Legionella (ACA1_114460, ACA1_091500, and ACA1_362260) and examined their roles in the formation of the excreted vesicles and escape of Legionella from the Acanthamoeba.
METHODS: After ingestion of Escherichia coli and Legionella pneumophila, expression levels of target genes in Acanthamoeba were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The roles of target genes were investigated by transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA). The formation of Legionella-containing excreted vesicles and the vesicular co-localization with the lysosomes were examined by Giemsa stain and LysoTracker stain.
RESULTS: ACA1_114460, ACA1_091500, and ACA1_362260 were upregulated after ingestion of Legionella in Acanthamoeba. ACA1_114460- and ACA1_091500-silenced Acanthamoeba failed to form the Legionella-containing excreted vesicles. Legionella was released as free legionellae from the Acanthamoeba. When the ACA1_362260 of Acanthamoeba was silenced, Legionella-containing excreted vesicles were fused with the lysosome.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that ACA1_114460, ACA1_091500, and ACA1_362260 of Acanthamoeba played important roles in the formation of Legionella-containing excreted vesicles and inhibition of the lysosomal co-localization with the phagosome.","['Kim MJ', 'Moon EK', 'Jo HJ', 'Quan FS', 'Kong HH']",2023,16,1,Parasit Vectors,"Kim MJ, et al.

37353007,Validation of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of Legionella pneumophila in hospital water networks.,"BACKGROUND: Rapid monitoring of Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is essential to reduce the risk of Legionnaires' disease in healthcare facilities. However, culture results take at least eight days, delaying the implementation of corrective measures. Here, we assessed the performance of a qPCR method and determined qPCR action thresholds for the detection of Lp in hospital hot water networks (HWNs).
METHODS: Hot water samples (N = 459) were collected from a hospital HWN. Lp were quantified using iQ-Check® Quanti real-time PCR Quantification kits (Bio-Rad) and the results were compared with those of culture. qPCR thresholds corresponding to the culture action thresholds of 10 and 1000 cfu/L were determined on a training dataset and validated on an independent dataset.
RESULTS: Lp concentrations measured by culture and qPCR were correlated for both the training dataset (Spearman's correlation coefficient ρ = 0.687, P<0.0001) and the validation dataset (ρ = 0.661, P<0.0001). Lp qPCR positivity thresholds corresponding to culture action thresholds of 10 cfu/L was 91 genome units (gu) per litre (sensitivity, 86.4%; negative predictive value - NPV, 93.3%) and that corresponding to culture action thresholds of 1000 cfu/L was 1048 gu/L (sensitivity, 100%; NPV, 100%).
CONCLUSION: Detection of Lp by qPCR could be implemented with confidence in hospitals as a complement to culture in the monitoring strategy to speed up the implementation of corrective measures.","['Sauget M', 'Richard M', 'Chassagne S', 'Hocquet D', 'Bertrand X', 'Jeanvoine A']",2023,138,,J Hosp Infect,"Sauget M, et al.

37347796,Effector-mediated subversion of proteasome activator (PA)28αβ enhances host defense against Legionella pneumophila under inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions.,"Legionella pneumophila is a natural pathogen of amoebae that causes Legionnaires' Disease in immunocompromised individuals via replication within macrophages. L. pneumophila virulence and intracellular replication hinges on hundreds of Dot/Icm-translocated effector proteins, which are essential for biogenesis of the replication-permissive Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). However, effector activity can also enhance mammalian host defense via effector-triggered immunity. The L. pneumophila effector LegC4 is important for virulence in amoebae but enhances host defense against L. pneumophila in the mouse lung and, uniquely, within macrophages activated with either tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interferon (IFN)-γ. The mechanism by which LegC4 potentiates cytokine-mediated host defense in macrophages is unknown. Here, we found that LegC4 enhances cytokine-mediated phagolysosomal fusion with Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) and binds host proteasome activator (PA)28α, which forms a heterooligomer with PA28β to facilitate ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of oxidant-damaged (carbonylated) proteins. We found that oxidative stress was sustained in the presence of LegC4 and that the LegC4 restriction phenotype was relieved in PA28αβ-deficient macrophages and in the lungs of mice in vivo. Our data also show that oxidative stress is sufficient for LegC4-mediated restriction in macrophages producing PA28αβ. PA28αβ has been traditionally associated with antigen presentation; however, our data support a novel mechanism whereby effector-mediated subversion of PA28αβ enhances cell-autonomous host defense against L. pneumophila under inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions. This work provides a solid foundation to evaluate induced proteasome regulators as mediators of innate immunity.","['Ngwaga T', 'Chauhan D', 'Salberg AG', 'Shames SR']",2023,19,6,PLoS Pathog,"Ngwaga T, et al.

Two high-throughput laboratory-based PCR panels which return a result in 5.5 hours (h) have been developed to test for pathogens commonly associated with upper (Respiratory 1 Panel) and lower (Respiratory 3 Panel) respiratory tract infections (GeneFirst, Oxford). These could replace multiple diagnostic tests currently used.
METHODS: An online survey, completed by senior clinicians in the UK, France and Spain, was used to collect data on the diagnostic testing of immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults admitted to hospital with CAP, including the cost of diagnostics. Data were used to inform a cost-comparison model. For each country, the average cost of diagnostic testing per patient was calculated separately for immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The model compared three testing strategies with standard of care (SoC). In the Panel 1 strategy, the Respiratory 1 Panel was used for patients that would otherwise have tests which could be replaced by Respiratory 1 Panel, equivalent strategies for Respiratory 3 Panel and for both panels combined were assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 48 surveys were completed (UK = 17; France = 15; Spain = 16). Compared with SoC, the Panel 1 + 3 strategy was most favourable, resulting in cost savings for immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients respectively, of €22.09 (£18.50) and €26.12 (£21.88) in the UK, €99.60 and €108.77 in France and €27.07 and €51.87 in Spain.

37344851,Legionella associated rhabdomyolysis: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Infections have been recognized as an uncommon cause of rhabdomyolysis, with evidence indicating a worse prognosis when compared to rhabdomyolysis caused by other etiologies. Diseases caused by Legionella pneumophila can present variably, ranging from mild to severe illness, as is sometimes the case with pneumonia. In particular, the triad of Legionnaire's disease, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury is associated with a significant increase in the morbidity and mortality, with most patients requiring initiation of renal replacement therapy such as hemodialysis. While the exact mechanism of both the muscle and kidney injury in this setting remains unknown, several hypotheses exist, with some research suggesting multiple yet distinct processes occurring in both target organs.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, we describe a 53-year-old African American man who presented with Legionella pneumophila pneumonia complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. He was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and a 2-week course of azithromycin. His clinical status improved without necessitating renal replacement therapy or mechanical ventilation. We postulate that early recognition and treatment were key to his recovery. He was discharged 10 days later without recurrence of rhabdomyolysis at the time of this report.
CONCLUSION: While there are several well-established and more common causes of rhabdomyolysis, clinicians should recognize Legionella sp. as an etiology, given its association with significant morbidity and mortality.","['Ma H', 'Bavishi A', 'Jain B']",2023,17,1,J Med Case Rep,"Ma H, et al.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a study in South Australia to investigate the prokaryotic community of the plastisphere and its temporal changes over 4 weeks. We submerged six plastic types (i.e., High-Density Polyethylene [HDPE], Polyvinyl chloride [PVC], Low-Density Polyethylene [LDPE], Polypropylene [PP], Polystyrene [PS] and the understudied textile, polyester [PET]) and wood in seawater and sampled them weekly to characterize the prokaryotic community using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Our results showed that the plastisphere composition shifted significantly over short time scales (i.e., 4 weeks), and each plastic type had distinct groups of unique genera. In particular, the PVC plastisphere was dominated by Cellvibrionaceae taxa, distinguishing it from other plastics. Additionally, the textile polyester, which is rarely studied in plastisphere research, supported the growth of a unique group of 25 prokaryotic genera (which included the potential pathogenic Legionella genus). Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the colonization dynamics of the plastisphere over short time scales and contributes to narrowing the research gap on the southern hemisphere plastisphere.","['Silva V', 'Pérez V', 'Gillanders BM']",2023,,,Environ Microbiol,"Silva V, et al.

37307684,Pilot-scale assessment reveals effects of anode type and orthophosphate in governing antimicrobial capacity of copper for Legionella pneumophila control.,"Copper (Cu) is sometimes applied as an antimicrobial for controlling Legionella in hot water plumbing systems, but its efficacy is inconsistent. Here we examined the effects of Cu (0 - 2 mg/L), orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor (0 or 3 mg/L as phosphate), and water heater anodes (aluminum, magnesium, and powered anodes) on both bulk water and biofilm-associated L. pneumophila in pilot-scale water heater systems. Soluble, but not total, Cu was a good predictor of antimicrobial capacity of Cu. Even after months of exposure to very high Cu levels (>1.2 mg/L) and low pH (<7), which increases solubility and enhances bioavailability of Cu, culturable L. pneumophila was only reduced by ∼1-log. Cu antimicrobial capacity was shown to be limited by various factors, including binding of Cu ions by aluminum hydroxide precipitates released from corrosion of aluminum anodes, higher pH due to magnesium anode corrosion, and high Cu tolerance of the outbreak-associated L. pneumophila strain that was inoculated into the systems. L. pneumophila numbers were also higher in several instances when Cu was dosed together with orthophosphate (e.g., with an Al anode), revealing at least one scenario where high levels of total Cu appeared to stimulate Legionella. The controlled, pilot-scale nature of this study provides new understanding of the limitations of Cu as an antimicrobial in real-world plumbing systems.","['Song Y', 'Pruden A', 'Rhoads WJ', 'Edwards MA']",2023,242,,Water Res,"Song Y, et al.

We analysed the organisms implicated, sources identified and infection prevention and control strategies implemented. The most commonly implicated pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-tuberculous mycobacteria and Legionella pneumophila. Bloodstream infection was the most common clinical presentation. The majority of incidents employed multi-modal strategies to achieve control, addressing both the water source and routes of transmission.

37279255,"TNF licenses macrophages to undergo rapid caspase-1, -11, and -8-mediated cell death that restricts Legionella pneumophila infection.","The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is necessary for host defense against many intracellular pathogens, including Legionella pneumophila. Legionella causes the severe pneumonia Legionnaires' disease and predominantly affects individuals with a suppressed immune system, including those receiving therapeutic TNF blockade to treat autoinflammatory disorders. TNF induces pro-inflammatory gene expression, cellular proliferation, and survival signals in certain contexts, but can also trigger programmed cell death in others. It remains unclear, however, which of the pleiotropic functions of TNF mediate control of intracellular bacterial pathogens like Legionella. In this study, we demonstrate that TNF signaling licenses macrophages to die rapidly in response to Legionella infection. We find that TNF-licensed cells undergo rapid gasdermin-dependent, pyroptotic death downstream of inflammasome activation. We also find that TNF signaling upregulates components of the inflammasome response, and that the caspase-11-mediated non-canonical inflammasome is the first inflammasome to be activated, with caspase-1 and caspase-8 mediating delayed pyroptotic death. We find that all three caspases are collectively required for optimal TNF-mediated restriction of bacterial replication in macrophages. Furthermore, caspase-8 is required for control of pulmonary Legionella infection. These findings reveal a TNF-dependent mechanism in macrophages for activating rapid cell death that is collectively mediated by caspases-1, -8, and -11 and subsequent restriction of Legionella infection.","['Pollock TY', 'Vázquez Marrero VR', 'Brodsky IE', 'Shin S']",2023,19,6,PLoS Pathog,"Pollock TY, et al.

To analyze the community structure during water purification and distribution, we selected a distribution system in which water from other water treatment facilities was not mixed with the target water. Changes in the bacterial community structure during treatment and distribution processes in a slow filtration water treatment facility were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with a portable sequencer MinION. The microbial diversity was reduced by chlorination. The genus level diversity increased during distribution and this diversity was maintained through to the terminal tap water. Yersinia and Aeromonas were dominant in the intake water, and Legionella was dominant in the slow sand filtered water. Chlorination greatly reduced the relative abundance of Yersinia, Aeromonas, and Legionella, and these bacteria were not detected in the terminal tap water. Sphingomonas, Starkeya and Methylobacterium became dominant in the water after chlorination. These bacteria could be used as important indicator bacteria to provide useful information for microbiological control in drinking water distribution systems.","['Koizumi Y', 'Ichijo T', 'Uchii K', 'Nasu M']",2023,28,1,J Microorg Control,"Koizumi Y, et al.

37270942,Building water quality deterioration during water supply restoration after interruption: Influences of premise plumbing configuration.,"Premise plumbing plays an essential role in determining the final quality of drinking water consumed by customers. However, little is known about the influences of plumbing configuration on water quality changes. This study selected parallel premise plumbing in the same building with different configurations, i.e., laboratory and toilet plumbing. Water quality deteriorations induced by premise plumbing under regular and interrupted water supply were investigated. The results showed that most of the water quality parameters did not vary under regular supply, except Zn, which was significantly increased by laboratory plumbing (78.2 to 260.7 µg/l). For the bacterial community, the Chao1 index was significantly increased by both plumbing types to a similar level (52 to 104). Laboratory plumbing significantly changed the bacterial community, but toilet plumbing did not. Remarkably, water supply interruption/restoration led to serious water quality deterioration in both plumbing types but resulted in different changes. Physiochemically, discoloration was observed only in laboratory plumbing, along with sharp increases in Mn and Zn. Microbiologically, the increase in ATP was sharper in toilet plumbing than in laboratory plumbing. Some opportunistic pathogen-containing genera, e.g., Legionella spp. and Pseudomonas spp., were present in both plumbing types but only in disturbed samples. This study highlighted the esthetic, chemical, and microbiological risks associated with premise plumbing, for which system configuration plays an important role. Attention should be given to optimizing premise plumbing design for managing building water quality.","['Yao M', 'Zhang Y', 'Dai Z', 'Ren A', 'Fang J', 'Li X', 'van der Meer W', 'Medema G', 'Rose JB', 'Liu G']",2023,241,,Water Res,"Yao M, et al.

METHODS: Prospective multicenter study conducted in immunocompetent patients hospitalized with community-acquired Legionella or pneumococcal pneumonia (L-CAP or P-CAP) between 2002-2020. All cases were diagnosed based on positive UAT.
RESULTS: We included 1452 patients, 260 with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia (L-CAP) and 1192 with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia (P-CAP). The 30-day mortality was higher for L-CAP (6.2%) than for P-CAP (5%). After discharge and during the median follow-up durations of 11.4 and 8.43 years, 32.4% and 47.9% of patients with L-CAP and P-CAP died, and 82.3% and 97.4% died earlier than expected, respectively. The independent risk factors for shorter long-term survival were age >65 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure in L-CAP and the same first three factors plus nursing home residence, cancer, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, altered mental status, blood urea nitrogen ≥30 mg/dl, and congestive heart failure as a cardiac complication during hospitalization in P-CAP.
CONCLUSION: In patients diagnosed early by UAT, the long-term survival after L-CAP or P-CAP was shorter (particularly after P-CAP) than expected, and this shorter survival was mainly associated with age and comorbidities.","['Serrano L', 'Ruiz LA', 'Perez-Fernandez S', 'España PP', 'Gomez A', 'Gonzalez B', 'Uranga A', 'Castro S', 'Iriberri M', 'Zalacain R']",2023,134,,Int J Infect Dis,"Serrano L, et al.

We therefore evaluated the association between the timing of urinary antigen tests and in-hospital mortality in patients with Legionella pneumonia. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, a nationwide database of acute care inpatients in Japan. Patients who underwent Legionella urinary antigen tests on the day of admission formed the tested group. Patients who were tested on day 2 of admission or later or were unexamined formed the control group. We performed a propensity score matching analysis to compare in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay and duration of antibiotics use between the two groups. Results Of the 9,254 eligible patients, 6,933 were included in the tested group. One-to-one propensity score matching generated 1,945 pairs. The tested group had a significantly lower 30-day in-hospital mortality than the control group (5.7 vs. 7.7%; odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence intervals, 0.55-0.95; p=0.020). The tested group also showed a significantly shorter length of stay and duration of antibiotics use than the control group. Conclusions Urine antigen testing upon admission was associated with better outcomes in patients with Legionella pneumonia.

Although STEC O157:H7 is the serotype most frequently associated with HUS, a major outbreak of HUS occurred in 2011 in Germany and was caused by a rare serotype, STEC O104:H4. Prior to 2011 and since the outbreak, STEC O104:H4 strains have only rarely been associated with human infections. From 2012 to 2020, intensified STEC surveillance was performed in Germany where the subtyping of ~8,000 clinical isolates by molecular methods, including whole-genome sequencing, was carried out. A rare STEC serotype, O181:H4, associated with HUS was identified, and like the STEC O104:H4 outbreak strain, this strain belongs to sequence type 678 (ST678).

We analyzed the temporal, geographic, and demographic epidemiology and microbiology of Legionnaires' disease in New Zealand by using notification and laboratory-based surveillance data for 2000‒2020. We used Poisson regression models to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% CIs to compare demographic and organism trends over 2 time periods (2000-2009 and 2010-2020). The mean annual incidence rate increased from 1.6 cases/100,000 population for 2000-2009 to 3.9 cases/100,000 population for 2010-2020. This increase corresponded with a change in diagnostic testing from predominantly serology with some culture to almost entirely molecular methods using PCR. There was also a marked shift in the identified dominant causative organism, from Legionella pneumophila to L. longbeachae. Surveillance for legionellosis could be further enhanced by greater use of molecular typing of isolates.","['Graham FF', 'Harte D', 'Zhang J', 'Fyfe C', 'Baker MG']",2023,29,6,Emerg Infect Dis,"Graham FF, et al.

The incidence of this disease has been increasing since 2005 and has continued to increase following the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Furthermore, Legionella pneumonia mortality rates have increased slightly since the pandemic due to some plausible reasons. The increased proportion of older patients with legionellosis might affect it because advanced age is a major risk factor for disease mortality. Additionally, physicians were focused on COVID-19 while examining febrile patients; therefore, they might have missed the early diagnosis of other respiratory infections, including Legionella pneumonia.","['Yamasue M', 'Komiya K', 'Kinjo T', 'Ito A', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Iwanaga N', 'Ishii M', 'Tateda K', 'Kawakami K']",2023,61,4,Respir Investig,"Yamasue M, et al.

37193230,Microbial profile and antibiotic resistance pattern of water supply in a tertiary care hospital of Uttarakhand.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In healthcare settings, hospital water and water-related devices can act as a reservoir for waterborne infections. Potable water, sinks, faucet aerators, showers, tub immersion, toilets, dialysis water, water baths, eyewash stations, and dental-unit water stations have all been linked to nosocomial outbreaks. This study aimed to determine the microbial profile and pattern of antibiotic resistance in the water supply of a tertiary care hospital in Uttarakhand.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a 1-year prospective study which was carried out by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Sri Mahant Indersh Hospital (SMIH), Dehradun. A total of 154 water samples were collected from the AC outlets, ventilators in the Intensive care unit (ICUs), Operation theatre (OTs), and High dependency unit (HDUs), scrub stations, pantry, and blood bank, patient's bathroom, private ward, septic ward, labour room, transplant unit, laboratory, scope rinse water, the dialysis unit and tank throughout the hospital, including tap water (pre and post flush [25%]), tap swabs (24%), drinking water (9%), AC outlets (13%), and other areas (3%).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Despite this recommendation, our laboratory has kept confirming all presumptive Legionella colonies by combining the subculture method with the latex agglutination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Here, we show that the ISO 11731:2017 method adequately performs in our laboratory according to ISO 13843:2017. We compared the performance of the ISO method in detecting Legionella in typical and atypical colonies (n = 7156) from health care facilities (HCFs) water samples to that of our combined protocol, and we found a 2.1% false positive rate (FPR), underscoring the importance of combining agglutination test and PCR with subculture to achieve optimal confirmation. Lastly, we estimated the water system disinfection cost for HCFs (n = 7), which due to false positive results, would display Legionella values exceeding the threshold of risk acceptance established by the Italian guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this large-scale study indicates that the ISO 11731:2017 confirmation method is error-prone, leading to significant FPRs, and higher costs for HCFs due to remedial actions on their water systems.","['Ditommaso S', 'Giacomuzzi M', 'Memoli G', 'Garlasco J', 'Zotti CM']",2023,134,6,J Appl Microbiol,"Ditommaso S, et al.

Outbreaks have confirmed that air conditioning and potable water systems can be sources of community-acquired LD. However, studying the association between water quality and LD incidence has been challenging due to the heterogeneity of water systems across large geographic areas. Furthermore, although seasonal trends in incidence have been linked to increased rainfall and temperatures, the large geographic units have posed similar difficulties. To address this issue, a retrospective ecological study was conducted in Washington, DC, from 2001 to 2019. The study identified aseasonal pattern of LD incidence, with the majority of cases occurring between June and December, peaking in August, October, and November. Increased temperature was found to be associated with LD incidence. In surface water, higher concentrations of manganese, iron, and strontium were positively associated with LD, while aluminum and orthophosphate showed a negative association. Intreatment plant water, higher concentrations of total organic carbon, aluminum, barium, and chlorine were positively associated with LD, while strontium, zinc, and orthophosphate showed a negative association. The results for orthophosphates and turbidity were inconclusive, indicating the need for further research.","['Kirpich A', 'Shishkin A', 'Lhewa P', 'Yang C', 'von Fricken ME', 'Norris MH', 'Weppelmann TA']",2023,151,,Epidemiol Infect,"Kirpich A, et al.

37178842,A comprehensive approach to how hospital effluents lead to oxidative stress and shift the gene expression in target organs of Danio rerio.,"Hospital effluents represent a threat to the environment owing to the content of toxic substances capable of altering the structure and function of ecosystems. Despite the available information about the impact of hospital effluents on aquatic organisms, the molecular mechanism underlying this process has received little or no attention. The present study aimed to evaluate the oxidative stress and gene expression induced by different proportions (2 %, 2.5 %, 3 % and 3.5 %) of hospital effluent treated by hospital wastewater treatment plant (HWWTP) in liver, gut, and gills of Danio rerio at different exposure times. Significant increases in the levels of protein carbonylation content (PCC), hydroperoxides content (HPC), lipoperoxidation level (LPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity were observed in most of the organs evaluated at the four proportions tested with respect to the control group (p < 0.05). It was found that at longer exposure times there is a lower response in SOD activity, suggesting catalytic depletion due to the oxidative environment at the intracellular level. The lack of complementarity between SOD and mRNA activity patterns indicates that the activity itself is subordinated to post-transcriptional processes. Upregulation of transcripts related to antioxidant processes (sod, cat, nrf2), detoxification (cyp1a1) and apoptosis (bax, casp6, and casp9) was observed in response to oxidative imbalance. On the other hand, the metataxonomic approach allowed the characterization of pathogenic bacterial genera such as Legionella, Pseudomonas, Clostridium XI, Parachlamydia and Mycobacterium present in the hospital effluent. Our findings indicate that although hospital effluent was treated by HWWTP, it caused oxidative stress damage and disrupted gene expression by decreasing the antioxidant response in Danio rerio.","['Ramírez-Moreno FJ', 'Gómez-Oliván LM', 'Islas-Flores H', 'García-Medina S', 'Aguirre-Garrido JF', 'Hernández-Soto LM']",2023,887,,Sci Total Environ,"Ramírez-Moreno FJ, et al.

37164062,Effects of corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with Legionella pneumonia: A retrospective cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: Legionella pneumophila is an important cause of pneumonia, however there is scant literature assessing the therapeutic benefit of corticosteroids in treatment. We sought to investigate the association between corticosteroid use and in-hospital mortality for patients hospitalized with Legionella pneumonia.
METHODS: Data was collected retrospectively from January 2012 to July 2019 at a 705 bed hospital in New York City. Patients were included if they received a positive Legionella test. Exclusion criteria included age <18, concurrent immunosuppression, and HIV diagnosis. We assessed the relationship between corticosteroid use and in-hospital mortality. Statistical analyses were performed in RStudio.
RESULTS: The study included 160 patients, among which 32 (20%) received steroids. Overall mortality was 7.5% (12.5% among steroid recipients, 6.2% among controls). 25% of patients were admitted to the ICU (37.5% among steroid recipients, 21.9% among controls). Adjusted analysis showed steroid recipients did not have significantly different mortality (aOR = 2.56, p = 0.436). Steroid use was not significantly associated with longer LOS (p = 0.22). Steroid use was significantly associated with hyperglycemia (aOR = 2.91, p = 0.018) and GI bleed (OR = 9.0, p = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that in patients hospitalized with Legionella pneumonia, corticosteroid administration was not significantly associated with longer hospitalization or mortality. All findings held true when adjusting for known predictors of pneumonia severity. Corticosteroid use was associated with increased rates of hyperglycemia and GIB requiring blood transfusion. The results of this study are consistent with guidelines recommending against routine use of corticosteroids in CAP.","['Beaty W', 'Elnadoury O', 'Fridman D', 'Louie E', 'Lubinsky AS']",2023,29,9,J Infect Chemother,"Beaty W, et al.

37156500,Legionella pneumophila-mediated host posttranslational modifications.,"Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium ubiquitously present in freshwater environments and causes a serious type of pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. During infections, L. pneumophila releases >300 effector proteins into host cells through an Icm/Dot type IV secretion system to manipulate the host defense system for survival within the hosts. Notably, certain effector proteins mediate posttranslational modifications (PTMs), serving as useful approaches exploited by L. pneumophila to modify host proteins. Some effectors catalyze the addition of host protein PTMs, while others mediate the removal of PTMs of host proteins. In this review, we summarize L. pneumophila effector-mediated PTMs of host proteins, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, AMPylation, phosphocholination, methylation, ADP-ribosylation, as well as dephosphorylation, deubiquitination, deAMPylation, deADP-ribosylation, dephosphocholination, and delipidation. We describe their molecular mechanisms and biological functions in the regulation of bacterial growth and Legionella-containing vacuole biosynthesis and in the disruption of host immune and defense machinery.","['Yang Y', 'Mei L', 'Chen J', 'Chen X', 'Wang Z', 'Liu L', 'Yang A']",2023,,,J Mol Cell Biol,"Yang Y, et al.

37155695,Hiding in the yolk: A unique feature of Legionella pneumophila infection of zebrafish.,"The zebrafish has become a powerful model organism to study host-pathogen interactions. Here, we developed a zebrafish model to dissect the innate immune response to Legionella pneumophila during infection. We show that L. pneumophila cause zebrafish larvae death in a dose dependent manner. Additionally, we show that macrophages are the first line of defence and cooperate with neutrophils to clear the infection. Immunocompromised humans have an increased propensity to develop pneumonia, similarly, when either macrophages or neutrophils are depleted, these ""immunocompromised"" larvae become lethally sensitive to L. pneumophila. Also, as observed in human infections, the adaptor signalling molecule Myd88 is not required to control disease in the larvae. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokine genes il1β and tnf-α were upregulated during infection, recapitulating key immune responses seen in human infection. Strikingly, we uncovered a previously undescribed infection phenotype in zebrafish larvae, whereby bloodborne, wild type L. pneumophila invade and grow in the larval yolk region, a phenotype not observed with a type IV secretion system deficient mutant that cannot translocate effectors into its host cell. Thus, zebrafish larva represents an innovative L. pneumophila infection model that mimics important aspects of the human immune response to L. pneumophila infection and will allow the elucidation of mechanisms by which type IV secretion effectors allow L. pneumophila to cross host cell membranes and obtain nutrients from nutrient rich environments.","['Viana F', 'Boucontet L', 'Laghi V', 'Schator D', 'Ibranosyan M', 'Jarraud S', 'Colucci-Guyon E', 'Buchrieser C']",2023,19,5,PLoS Pathog,"Viana F, et al.

37137207,Water quality influences Legionella pneumophila determination.,"Legionellosis is a respiratory disease of public health concern. The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is the etiologic agent responsible for >90% of legionellosis cases in the United States. Legionellosis transmission primarily occurs through the inhalation or aspiration of contaminated water aerosols or droplets. Therefore, a thorough understanding of L. pneumophila detection methods and their performance in various water quality conditions is needed to develop preventive measures. Two hundred and nine potable water samples were collected from taps in buildings across the United States. L. pneumophila was determined using three culture methods: Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract (BCYE) culture with Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) identification, Legiolert® 10- and 100-mL tests, and one molecular method: quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assay. Culture and molecular positive results were confirmed by secondary testing including MALDI-MS. Eight water quality variables were studied, including source water type, secondary disinfectant, total chlorine residual, heterotrophic bacteria, total organic carbon (TOC), pH, water hardness, cold- and hot-water lines. The eight water quality variables were segmented into 28 categories, based on scale and ranges, and method performance was evaluated in each of these categories. Additionally, a Legionella genus qPCR assay was used to determine the water quality variables that promote or hinder Legionella spp. occurrence. L. pneumophila detection frequency ranged from 2 to 22% across the methods tested.

37117271,Food provisioning to Pardosa spiders decreases the levels of tissue-resident endosymbiotic bacteria.,"The diversity, host specificity, and physiological effects of endosymbiotic bacteria in spiders (Araneae) are poorly characterized. We used 16S rDNA sequencing to evaluate endosymbionts in the cephalothorax and legs of a wolf spider Pardosa agrestis. We tested the effects of feeding once or twice daily with fruit flies, aphids, or starved and compared them to those of syntopically occurring Pardosa palustris. The feeding increased traveled distance up to five times in some of the groups provisioned with food relative to the starved control. The Shannon diversity t-test revealed significant differences between these component communities of the two spider species. The increased frequency of feeding with fruit flies, but not aphids, increased the dominance and decreased the alpha diversity of OTUs. The obligate or facultative endosymbionts were present in all analyzed spider individuals and were represented mostly by Rickettsiella, Rhabdochlamydia, Spiroplasma, and the facultative intracellular parasite Legionella. Vertically transmitted endosymbionts were less common, represented by Wolbachia pipientis and Rickettsia sp. H820. The relative abundance of Mycoplasma spp. was negatively correlated with provisioned or killed aphids. In conclusion, the tissues of Pardosa spiders host tremendously diverse assemblages of bacteria, including obligate or facultative endosymbionts, with yet unknown phenotypic effects.","['Řezáč M', 'Řezáčová V', 'Gloríková N', 'Némethová E', 'Heneberg P']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Řezáč M, et al.

37113451,"Confounding Effect of Undergraduate Semester-Driven ""Academic"" Internet Searches on the Ability to Detect True Disease Seasonality in Google Trends Data: Fourier Filter Method Development and Demonstration.","BACKGROUND: Internet search volume for medical information, as tracked by Google Trends, has been used to demonstrate unexpected seasonality in the symptom burden of a variety of medical conditions. However, when more technical medical language is used (eg, diagnoses), we believe that this technique is confounded by the cyclic, school year-driven internet search patterns of health care students.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) demonstrate that artificial ""academic cycling"" of Google Trends' search volume is present in many health care terms, (2) demonstrate how signal processing techniques can be used to filter academic cycling out of Google Trends data, and (3) apply this filtering technique to some clinically relevant examples.
METHODS: We obtained the Google Trends search volume data for a variety of academic terms demonstrating strong academic cycling and used a Fourier analysis technique to (1) identify the frequency domain fingerprint of this modulating pattern in one particularly strong example, and (2) filter that pattern out of the original data. After this illustrative example, we then applied the same filtering technique to internet searches for information on 3 medical conditions believed to have true seasonal modulation (myocardial infarction, hypertension, and depression), and all bacterial genus terms within a common medical microbiology textbook.
RESULTS: Academic cycling explains much of the seasonal variation in internet search volume for many technically oriented search terms, including the bacterial genus term [""Staphylococcus""], for which academic cycling explained 73.8% of the variability in search volume (using the squared Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 
CONCLUSIONS: Although it is reasonable to search for seasonal modulation of medical conditions using Google Trends' internet search volume and lay-appropriate search terms, the variation in more technical search terms may be driven by health care students whose search frequency varies with the academic school year. When this is the case, using Fourier analysis to filter out academic cycling is a potential means to establish whether additional seasonality is present.","['Gillis T', 'Garrison S']",2022,2,2,JMIR Infodemiology,"Gillis T and Garrison S.

37076474,Dephosphocholination by Legionella effector Lem3 functions through remodelling of the switch II region of Rab1b.,"Bacterial pathogens often make use of post-translational modifications to manipulate host cells. Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires disease, secretes the enzyme AnkX that uses cytidine diphosphate-choline to post-translationally modify the human small G-Protein Rab1 with a phosphocholine moiety at Ser76. Later in the infection, the Legionella enzyme Lem3 acts as a dephosphocholinase, hydrolytically removing the phosphocholine. While the molecular mechanism for Rab1 phosphocholination by AnkX has recently been resolved, structural insights into the activity of Lem3 remained elusive. Here, we stabilise the transient Lem3:Rab1b complex by substrate mediated covalent capture. Through crystal structures of Lem3 in the apo form and in complex with Rab1b, we reveal Lem3's catalytic mechanism, showing that it acts on Rab1 by locally unfolding it. Since Lem3 shares high structural similarity with metal-dependent protein phosphatases, our Lem3:Rab1b complex structure also sheds light on how these phosphatases recognise protein substrates.","['Kaspers MS', 'Pogenberg V', 'Pett C', 'Ernst S', 'Ecker F', 'Ochtrop P', 'Groll M', 'Hedberg C', 'Itzen A']",2023,14,1,Nat Commun,"Kaspers MS, et al.

37074657,Imaging Flow Cytometry of Legionella-Containing Vacuoles in Intact and Homogenized Wild-Type and Mutant Dictyostelium.,"The causative agent of a severe pneumonia termed ""Legionnaires' disease"", Legionella pneumophila, replicates within protozoan and mammalian phagocytes in a specialized intracellular compartment called the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). This compartment does not fuse with bactericidal lysosomes but communicates extensively with several cellular vesicle trafficking pathways and eventually associates tightly with the endoplasmic reticulum. In order to comprehend in detail the complex process of LCV formation, the identification and kinetic analysis of cellular trafficking pathway markers on the pathogen vacuole are crucial. This chapter describes imaging flow cytometry (IFC)-based methods for the objective, quantitative and high-throughput analysis of different fluorescently tagged proteins or probes on the LCV. To this end, we use the haploid amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum as an infection model for L. pneumophila, to analyze either fixed intact infected host cells or LCVs from homogenized amoebae. Parental strains and isogenic mutant amoebae are compared in order to determine the contribution of a specific host factor to LCV formation. The amoebae simultaneously produce two different fluorescently tagged probes enabling tandem quantification of two LCV markers in intact amoebae or the identification of LCVs using one probe and quantification of the other probe in host cell homogenates. The IFC approach allows rapid generation of statistically robust data from thousands of pathogen vacuoles and can be applied to other infection models.","['Welin A', 'Hüsler D', 'Hilbi H']",2023,2635,,Methods Mol Biol,"Welin A, et al.

37074383,Early succession of biofilm bacterial communities in newly built drinking water pipelines via multi-area analysis.,"Biofilms inhabiting pipeline walls are critical to drinking water quality and safety. With massive pipeline replacement underway, however, biofilm formation process in newly built pipes and its effects on water quality are unclear. Moreover, differences and connections between biofilms in newly built and old pipes are unknown. In this study, early succession (≤ 120 days) of biofilm bacterial communities (abundance and diversity) in upper, middle and bottom areas of a newly built cement-lined ductile iron pipeline were evaluated using improved Propella™ biofilm reactor and multi-area analysis. A comparison with old pipelines (grey cast iron, 10 years) was performed. In the newly built pipeline, the abundance of biofilm bacteria did not change significantly between 40 and 80 days, but increased significantly between 80 and 120 days. The biofilm bacterial abundance (per unit area) in the bottom area was always higher than that in the upper and middle areas. Based on alpha diversity index and PCoA results, biofilm bacterial community richness, diversity and composition did not change significantly during the 120-day operation. Besides, biofilm shedding from the walls of newly built pipeline significantly increased bacterial abundance in the outlet water. Opportunistic pathogen-containing genera, such as Burkholderia, Acinetobacter and Legionella, were identified in both water and biofilm samples from newly built pipelines. The comparison between new and old pipelines suggested a higher bacterial abundance per unit area at the middle and bottom areas in old pipelines. Moreover, the bacterial community composition of biofilms in old pipelines was similar to that of newly built pipelines. These results contribute to accurate prediction and management of biofilm microbial communities in drinking water pipelines, ensuring the biosafety of drinking water. KEY POINTS: • Biofilm bacterial communities in different areas of pipe wall were revealed. • The abundance of biofilm bacteria increased significantly between 80 and 120 days. • Biofilm bacterial community compositions of newly built and old pipes were similar.","['Chen X', 'Xiao L', 'Niu J', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Gong L', 'Yao F', 'Xu K']",2023,107,11,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,"Chen X, et al.

37059987,Identification of priority pathogens for aetiological diagnosis in adults with community-acquired pneumonia in China: a multicentre prospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major public health challenge worldwide. However, the aetiological and disease severity-related pathogens associated with CAP in adults in China are not well established based on the detection of both viral and bacterial agents.
METHODS: A multicentre, prospective study was conducted involving 10 hospitals located in nine geographical regions in China from 2014 to 2019. Sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected from each recruited CAP patient. Multiplex real-time PCR and bacteria culture methods were used to detect respiratory pathogens. The association between detected pathogens and CAP severity was evaluated.
RESULTS: Among the 3,403 recruited eligible patients, 462 (13.58%) had severe CAP, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.94% (66/3,403). At least one pathogen was detected in 2,054 (60.36%) patients, with two or more pathogens were co-detected in 725 patients. The ten major pathogens detected were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (11.05%), Haemophilus influenzae (10.67%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.43%), influenza A virus (9.49%), human rhinovirus (9.02%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.43%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.50%), adenovirus (2.94%), respiratory syncytial viruses (2.35%), and Legionella pneumophila (1.03%), which accounted for 76.06-92.52% of all positive detection results across sampling sites. Klebsiella pneumoniae (p < 0.001) and influenza viruses (p = 0.005) were more frequently detected in older patients, whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae was more frequently detected in younger patients (p < 0.001). Infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses were risk factors for severe CAP.
CONCLUSIONS: The major respiratory pathogens causing CAP in adults in China were different from those in USA and European countries, which were consistent across different geographical regions over study years. Given the detection rate of pathogens and their association with severe CAP, we propose to include the ten major pathogens as priorities for clinical pathogen screening in China.","['Zhang L', 'Xiao Y', 'Zhang G', 'Li H', 'Zhao J', 'Chen M', 'Chen F', 'Liu L', 'Li Y', 'Peng L', 'Zhao F', 'Yang D', 'Wen Z', 'Wu L', 'Wu S', 'Sun Y', 'Wang Y', 'Chen L', 'Wang X', 'Wang L', 'Li W', 'Qiu H', 'Chen Y', 'Gao Z', 'Ren L', 'Wang J']",2023,23,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Zhang L, et al.

37059817,Legionella para-effectors target chromatin and promote bacterial replication.,"Legionella pneumophila replicates intracellularly by secreting effectors via a type IV secretion system. One of these effectors is a eukaryotic methyltransferase (RomA) that methylates K14 of histone H3 (H3K14me3) to counteract host immune responses. However, it is not known how L. pneumophila infection catalyses H3K14 methylation as this residue is usually acetylated. Here we show that L. pneumophila secretes a eukaryotic-like histone deacetylase (LphD) that specifically targets H3K14ac and works in synergy with RomA. Both effectors target host chromatin and bind the HBO1 histone acetyltransferase complex that acetylates H3K14. Full activity of RomA is dependent on the presence of LphD as H3K14 methylation levels are significantly decreased in a ∆lphD mutant. The dependency of these two chromatin-modifying effectors on each other is further substantiated by mutational and virulence assays revealing that the presence of only one of these two effectors impairs intracellular replication, while a double knockout (∆lphD∆romA) can restore intracellular replication. Uniquely, we present evidence for ""para-effectors"", an effector pair, that actively and coordinately modify host histones to hijack the host response. The identification of epigenetic marks modulated by pathogens has the potential to lead to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to counteract bacterial infection and strengthening host defences.","['Schator D', 'Mondino S', 'Berthelet J', 'Di Silvestre C', 'Ben Assaya M', 'Rusniok C', 'Rodrigues-Lima F', 'Wehenkel A', 'Buchrieser C', 'Rolando M']",2023,14,1,Nat Commun,"Schator D, et al.

37038177,Genome-wide association reveals host-specific genomic traits in Escherichia coli.,"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is an opportunistic pathogen which colonizes various host species. However, to what extent genetic lineages of E. coli are adapted or restricted to specific hosts and the genomic determinants of such adaptation or restriction is poorly understood.
RESULTS: We randomly sampled E. coli isolates from four countries (Germany, UK, Spain, and Vietnam), obtained from five host species (human, pig, cattle, chicken, and wild boar) over 16 years, from both healthy and diseased hosts, to construct a collection of 1198 whole-genome sequenced E. coli isolates. We identified associations between specific E. coli lineages and the host from which they were isolated. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified several E. coli genes that were associated with human, cattle, or chicken hosts, whereas no genes associated with the pig host could be found. In silico characterization of nine contiguous genes (collectively designated as nan-9) associated with the human host indicated that these genes are involved in the metabolism of sialic acids (Sia). In contrast, the previously described sialic acid regulon known as sialoregulon (i.e. nanRATEK-yhcH, nanXY, and nanCMS) was not associated with any host species. In vitro growth experiments with a Δnan-9 E. coli mutant strain, using the sialic acids 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) as sole carbon source, showed impaired growth behaviour compared to the wild-type.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an extensive analysis of genetic determinants which may contribute to host specificity in E. coli.

37036108,A Critical Review on the Factors that Influence Opportunistic Premise Plumbing Pathogens: From Building Entry to Fixtures in Residences.,"Residential buildings provide unique conditions for opportunistic premise plumbing pathogen (OPPP) exposure via aerosolized water droplets produced by showerheads, faucets, and tubs. The objective of this review was to critically evaluate the existing literature that assessed the impact of potentially enhancing conditions to OPPP occurrence associated with residential plumbing and to point out knowledge gaps. Comprehensive studies on the topic were found to be lacking. Major knowledge gaps identified include the assessment of OPPP growth in the residential plumbing, from building entry to fixtures, and evaluation of the extent of the impact of typical residential plumbing design (e.g., trunk and branch and manifold), components (e.g., valves and fixtures), water heater types and temperature setting of operation, and common pipe materials (copper, PEX, and PVC/CPVC). In addition, impacts of the current plumbing code requirements on OPPP responses have not been assessed by any study and a lack of guidelines for OPPP risk management in residences was identified. Finally, the research required to expand knowledge on OPPP amplification in residences was discussed.","['Logan-Jackson AR', 'Batista MD', 'Healy W', 'Ullah T', 'Whelton AJ', 'Bartrand TA', 'Proctor C']",2023,57,16,Environ Sci Technol,"Logan-Jackson AR, et al.

To uncover L. pneumophila determinants facilitating survival in water, a Tn-seq strategy was used to identify survival-defective mutants during 50-day starvation in tap water at 42°C. The mutants with the most drastic survival defects carried insertions in electron transport chain genes, indicating that membrane energy charge and/or ATP synthesis requires the generation of a proton gradient by the respiratory chain to maintain survival in the presence of water stress.

36965315,Investigation of a legionellosis outbreak in Sydney CBD - a brief report.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify and control a source of Legionella in Sydney CBD.
METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological, environmental and genomic techniques were employed to identify cases and the source of Legionella.
RESULTS: Eleven legionellosis cases were linked to Sydney CBD with a median age of 69 years. All were hospitalised and had risk factors for Legionella infection. Eight of 11 cases identified as male. Genomic analysis linked three cases to a contaminated cooling water source in Sydney CBD, with a further case infected with a similar strain to that found in Sydney CBD. Another case, although epidemiologically linked to Sydney CBD, was infected with a genomically different strain to that found in Sydney CBD. Six other cases had no viable sample for genomic analysis.
CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: An outbreak of legionellosis is a serious public health threat that requires rapid investigation and environmental control. We were able to identify a source in Sydney CBD through the application of clinical, epidemiological, environmental and genomic techniques. Genomic analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to confirm the source location but requires close collaboration between clinicians, public health units and microbiologists to recover viable sputum cultures from cases diagnosed with legionellosis.","['Capon A', 'Cains T', 'Draper J', 'Sintchenko V', 'Ferson M', 'Sheppeard V']",2023,47,2,Aust N Z J Public Health,"Capon A, et al.

36931512,"Microbial assessment of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) in temporary and permanent settlements two years after Nepal 2015 earthquake.","Disaster-induced displacement often causes people to live in temporary settlements that have limited infrastructure and access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH). Reducing the risk of diarrheal diseases in such situations requires knowing how housing influences the presence of pathogens in water and the interaction between human settlements and exposure to pathogens. A cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2017 in two communities hard-hit by the Nepal 2015 earthquake: one recovered with newly reconstructed houses, and one recovered with residents still living in sheet metal temporary shelters constructed after the earthquake. We collected 60 water (30 drinking water and 30 cleaning water), 30 hand rinse, and 90 environmental swab samples (30 toilet handles, 30 utensils, and 30 water vessels) from selected households in each location and quantified 22 bacterial pathogens using microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (mfqPCR). A total of 59 samples were randomly selected for amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA, and it identified bacterial community profiles between these two settlements and their association with target genes of pathogenic bacteria. Target genes like uidA of Escherichia coli and the mip gene of Legionella pnuemophila showed significantly high frequency in specific sample types in temporary settlements than in permanent settlements. A significantly high concentration was observed in temporary settlements for Enterococcus spp. and S. typhimurium, specifically in swab samples. There was a sharp distinction of microbial community profiles between water and hand rinse samples with environmental swab samples, with a large abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria in swab samples in both settlements. This observation highlighted that fomite could be an important transmission route for pathogens in rural settings and designing key interventions to target different stages of transmission pathways is essential. Overall findings from this study suggest that the recovered settlement with higher quality housing may be less impacted by fecal contamination than recovering settlements and that interventions should be designed to disrupt multiple transmission pathways to reduce pathogen exposure.","['Uprety S', 'Sherchan SP', 'Narayanan P', 'Dangol B', 'Maggos M', 'Celmer A', 'Shisler J', 'Amarasiri M', 'Sano D', 'Nguyen TH']",2023,877,,Sci Total Environ,"Uprety S, et al.

A retrospective prediction by a dynamic regression model was created from 2012-16 data to assess excess cases in 2017-19. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to determine if a significant change in trend occurred in 2017-19 compared with the previous 5 years.ResultsWe found a 33.9% increase in cases in 2017-19 compared with the number predicted. The ITS also found a significant trend increase in 2017-19 compared with 2012-16. A significant trend increase was observed from 2017 most strongly among older age groups (> 60 years) and non-imported cases.ConclusionOur study showed a significant increasing trend in LD cases in the EU/EEA during 2017-19 compared with the previous 5 years. The distribution of cases per week suggests an overall amplification of the seasonal trends.

The main sources of infection and the cause for this high rate remain largely unknown. This hampers the implementation of targeted Legionella spp. control efforts. The SwissLEGIO national case-control and molecular source attribution study investigates risk factors and infection sources for community-acquired LD in Switzerland. Over the duration of one year, the study is recruiting 205 newly diagnosed LD patients through a network of 20 university and cantonal hospitals. Healthy controls matched for age, sex, and residence at district level are recruited from the general population. Risk factors for LD are assessed in questionnaire-based interviews. Clinical and environmental Legionella spp. isolates are compared using whole genome sequencing (WGS).

36840589,Multicenter Preparedness Exercise Enables Rapid Development of Cluster-Specific PCR-Based Screening Assays from Bacterial Genomic Data.,"PCR-based screening assays targeting strain-specific genetic markers allow the timely detection and specific differentiation of bacterial strains. Especially in situations where an infection cluster occurs, fast assay development is crucial for supporting targeted control measures. However, the turnaround times (TATs) for assay setup may be high due to insufficient knowledge about screening assay methods, workflows, and software tools. Here, two blind-coded and quality-controlled ring trials were performed in which five German laboratories established PCR-based screening assays from genomic data that specifically target selected bacterial clusters within two bacterial monospecies sample panels. While the first ring trial was conducted without a time limit to train the participants and assess assay feasibility, in the second ring trial, a challenging time limit of 2 weeks was set to force fast assay development as soon as genomic data were available. During both ring trials, we detected high interlaboratory variability regarding the screening assay methods and targets, the TATs for assay setup, and the number of screening assays. The participants designed between one and four assays per cluster that targeted cluster-specific unique genetic sequences, genes, or single nucleotide variants using conventional PCRs, high-resolution melting assays, or TaqMan PCRs. Assays were established within the 2-week time limit, with TATs ranging from 4 to 13 days. TaqMan probe delivery times strongly influenced TATs. In summary, we demonstrate that a specific exercise improved the preparedness to develop functional cluster-specific PCR-based screening assays from bacterial genomic data. Furthermore, the parallel development of several assays enhances assay availability.","['Treffon J', 'Prior K', 'Dreesman J', 'Egelkamp R', 'Flieger A', 'Middendorf-Bauchart B', 'Projahn M', 'Richter A', 'Schuh E', 'Harmsen D', 'Mellmann A']",2023,61,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Treffon J, et al.

36815834,"A Versatile Nanoluciferase Reporter Reveals Structural Properties Associated with a Highly Efficient, N-Terminal Legionella pneumophila Type IV Secretion Translocation Signal.","Many Gram-negative pathogens rely on type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for infection. One limitation has been the lack of ideal reporters to identify T4SS translocated effectors and study T4SS function. Most reporter systems make use of fusions to reporter proteins, in particular, β-lactamase (TEM) and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (CYA), that allow detection of translocated enzymatic activity inside host cells. However, both systems require costly reagents and use complex, multistep procedures for loading host cells with substrate (TEM) or for analysis (CYA). Therefore, we have developed and characterized a novel reporter system using nanoluciferase (NLuc) fusions to address these limitations. Serendipitously, we discovered that Nluc itself is efficiently translocated by Legionella pneumophila T4SS in an IcmSW chaperone-dependent manner via an N-terminal translocation signal. Extensive mutagenesis in the NLuc N terminus suggested the importance of an α-helical domain spanning D5 to V9, as mutations predicted to disrupt this structure, with one exception, were translocation defective. Notably, NLuc was capable of translocating several proteins examined when fused to the N or C terminus, while maintaining robust luciferase activity. In particular, it delivered the split GFP11 fragment into J774 macrophages transfected with GFPopt, thereby resulting in ","['Kang YS', 'Kirby JE']",2023,11,2,Microbiol Spectr,"Kang YS and Kirby JE.

36805271,eXtreme gradient boosting-based classification of bacterial mixtures in water and milk using wireless microscopic imaging of quorum sensing peptide-conjugated particles.,"Numerous bacteria can cause water- and foodborne diseases and are often found in bacterial mixtures, making their detection challenging. Specific bioreceptors or selective growth media are necessary for most bacterial detection methods. In this work, we collectively used five quorum sensing-based peptides identified from bacterial biofilms to identify 10 different bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and their mixtures in water and milk. Four different machine learning classification methods were used: k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Peptides were crosslinked to submicron particles, and peptide-bacteria interactions on paper microfluidic chips caused the particle aggregation. A wireless, pocket fluorescence microscope (interfaced with a smartphone) counted such particle aggregations. XGBoost showed the best accuracy of 83.75% in identifying bacterial species from water samples using 320 different datasets and 91.67% from milk samples using 140 different datasets (5 peptide features per dataset). Each peptide's contribution to correct classification was evaluated. The results were concentration-dependent, allowing the identification of a dominant species from bacterial mixtures. Using XGBoost and the previous milk database, we tested 14 blind samples of various bacterial mixtures in milk samples, with an accuracy of 81.55% to predict the dominant species. The entire process could be completed within a half hour. The demonstrated system can provide a handheld, low-cost, easy-to-operate tool for potential hygiene spot-checks, public health, or personal healthcare.","['Liang Y', 'Lee MH', 'Zhou A', 'Khanthaphixay B', 'Hwang DS', 'Yoon JY']",2023,227,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Liang Y, et al. eXtreme gradient boosting-based classification of bacterial mixtures in water and milk using wireless microscopic imaging of quorum sensing peptide-conjugated particles. eXtreme gradient boosting-based classification of bacterial mixtures in water and milk using wireless microscopic imaging of quorum sensing peptide-conjugated particles. 2023; 227:115144. doi: 10.1016/j.bios.2023.115144",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36805271/

36782173,Glial fibrillary acidic protein astrocytopathy and tuberculous meningoencephalitis occurring in a patient with Legionella pneumonia: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is a recently identified recurrent meningoencephalomyelitis with GFAP immunoglobulin G presence in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a specific biomarker. GFAP astrocytopathy is closely associated with the occurrence of some tumors and often coexists with other antibodies, such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and aquaporin-4 antibodies. However, GFAP astrocytopathy complicated by central nervous system infection is rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present the case of a patient admitted to a local hospital due to a prominent fever and cough. The patient had a 1-month history of headaches before admission that were not considered serious at the time. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed a high sequence number of Legionella pneumophila and a few mycobacteria. His cough and fever improved significantly after antibiotic treatment. Still, a slight headache remained. Subsequently, his condition worsened, and he visited our hospital with a disturbance of consciousness. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected with mNGS of the CSF, while the CSF and serum were also positive for GFAP antibodies. Following anti-tuberculosis and steroid therapy, the patient's symptoms improved, and he tested negative for the GFAP antibody.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of GFAP astrocytopathy complicated by tuberculous meningoencephalitis. Due to overlaps in the clinical manifestations of the two diseases, GFAP astrocytopathy is sometimes misdiagnosed as tuberculous meningoencephalitis. Therefore, in addition to ensuring careful identification of the two diseases, clinicians need to be aware of their possible co-existence.","['Li K', 'Wu J', 'Chen J', 'You Y']",2023,23,1,BMC Neurol,"Li K, et al.

36758031,Legionella longbeachae effector protein RavZ inhibits autophagy and regulates phagosome ubiquitination during infection.,"Legionella organisms are ubiquitous environmental bacteria that are responsible for human Legionnaires' disease, a fatal form of severe pneumonia. These bacteria replicate intracellularly in a wide spectrum of host cells within a distinct compartment termed the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). Effector proteins translocated by the Dot/Icm apparatus extensively modulate host cellular functions to aid in the biogenesis of the LCV and intracellular proliferation. RavZ is an L. pneumophila effector that functions as a cysteine protease to hydrolyze lipidated LC3, thereby compromising the host autophagic response to bacterial infection. In this study, we characterized the RavZ (RavZLP) ortholog in L. longbeachae (RavZLLO), the second leading cause of Legionella infections in the world. RavZLLO and RavZLP share approximately 60% sequence identity and a conserved His-Asp-Cys catalytic triad. RavZLLO is recognized by the Dot/Icm systems of both L. pneumophila and L. longbeachae. Upon translocation into the host, it suppresses autophagy signaling in cells challenged with both species, indicating the functional redundancy of RavZLLO and RavZLP. Additionally, ectopic expression of RavZLLO but not RavZLP in mammalian cells reduces the levels of cellular polyubiquitinated and polyneddylated proteins. Consistent with this process, RavZLLO regulates the accumulation of polyubiquitinated species on the LCV during L. longbeachae infection.","['Shi Y', 'Liu H', 'Ma K', 'Luo ZQ', 'Qiu J']",2023,18,2,PLoS One,"Shi Y, et al.

36739010,"Associations of household factors, hot water temperature, and chlorine residual with Legionella occurrence in single-family homes in New Jersey.","Only 4 % of reported Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases are outbreak-associated and the remaining 96 % are sporadic, for which no known source of Legionella is identified. Although outbreaks of LD are linked to cooling towers, decorative fountains, spas and hot tubs, and other sources, the drivers of sporadic LD are less known. Residential premise plumbing is likely an important source of aerosol exposure and there are unique features of premise plumbing which could lead to proliferation of Legionella. A sampling study of Legionella in single-family homes was undertaken in NJ from 2020 to 2021 which included a household characteristic survey and collection of hot water temperature and chlorine residual during sampling. A total of 94 homeowners residing in owner-occupied, single-family units with individual hot water systems were recruited to participate through two mechanisms (1) Legionnaire's disease case-patients and (2) non-case volunteers from each NJ county. Among the 94 single-family homes sampled, 15 % had least one sample positive for Legionella by culture and 57 % had at least one sample with detection of Legionella DNA markers by PCR. Chlorine residual, hot water temperature, and season were independently associated with increased detection of Legionella in home water samples. There was limited or inconsistent evidence of the role of household characteristic factors in Legionella detection. This study identified season, insufficient chlorine residual and hot water temperature as risk factors for Legionella detection in single-family homes. Findings from this work can promote additional partnership between public health and water utilities in improving chlorine residuals in residential communities and educating homeowners on best practices for home water management.","['Gleason JA', 'Conner LE', 'Ross KM']",2023,870,,Sci Total Environ,"Gleason JA, et al.

36717381,Exploitation of the host exocyst complex by bacterial pathogens.,"Intracellular bacterial pathogens remodel the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells in order to establish infection. A common and well-studied mechanism of plasma membrane remodelling involves bacterial stimulation of polymerization of the host actin cytoskeleton. Here, we discuss recent results showing that several bacterial pathogens also exploit the host vesicular trafficking pathway of 'polarized exocytosis' to expand and reshape specific regions in the plasma membrane during infection. Polarized exocytosis is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved octameric protein complex termed the exocyst. We describe examples in which the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Shigella flexneri co-opt the exocyst to promote internalization into human cells or intercellular spread within host tissues. We also discuss results showing that Legionella pneumophila or S. flexneri manipulate exocyst components to modify membrane vacuoles to favour intracellular replication or motility of bacteria. Finally, we propose potential ways that pathogens manipulate exocyst function, discuss how polarized exocytosis might promote infection and highlight the importance of future studies to determine how actin polymerization and polarized exocytosis are coordinated to achieve optimal bacterial infection.","['Ireton K', 'Gyanwali GC', 'Herath TUB', 'Lee N']",2023,120,1,Mol Microbiol,"Ireton K, et al.

36708652,Predicting Legionella contamination in cooling towers and evaporative condensers from microbiological and physicochemical parameters.,"BACKGROUND: Inhalation of Legionella-containing aerosols generated by cooling towers (CT) and evaporative condensers (EC) where water risk management is not performed correctly has been linked to a high percentage of community outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease (LD). Likewise, microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of the water in these facilities have been associated with this bacterium. The main aim of this study was to assess the risk of Legionella colonization in CT and EC based on the data for microbiological and physicochemical water quality provided by the Environmental Health Department and Laboratory of the City Council of L'Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona, Spain).
METHODS: Legionella was analysed in 789 samples collected from 127 CT and EC in 46 companies in Catalonia from 2002 to 2019. A two-step logistic regression analysis was carried out to assess the risk of colonization by Legionella in the studied facilities according to the microbiological (aerobic heterotrophic bacteria) and physicochemical (pH, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, conductivity, total iron and Langelier Index) water parameters. The optimal cut-off points for the water parameters predictive of Legionella contamination were defined as the values on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve where sensitivity and specificity were jointly maximized.
RESULTS: Legionella was isolated in 8.49% of the 789 analysed samples, 22.39% of which were heavily contaminated (with counts higher than 1.0 × 10

36698725,Diagnosis and Treatment of Water-Contaminated Severe Legionella Pneumonia with Digestive Symptoms as the First Symptom: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"INTRODUCTION: Although Legionella is not the most common pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia, the epidemiological distribution of pneumonia pathogens has changed in recent years, with a gradual increase in some rare pathogens. For example, pneumonia that occurs after water source contamination is mostly caused by Legionella infection. This paper reports the diagnosis and treatment process of a patient after Legionella infection, who had misdiagnosis at the beginning, rapidly progressed to severe disease and combined with fungal infection. This article focuses on the timely and effective treatment of rapidly progressing Legionella pneumonia, in anticipation of a better understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case of legionella infection with the nausea, vomiting as the first symptoms accompanied by weakness, chills, dizziness, abdominal discomfort in a 75-year-old female. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes for 30 years, diabetic peripheral neuropathy for more than 20 years, arterial hypertension for 10 years, bone hyperplasia for more than 5 years, resection of right-sided thyroid cystadenoma in 1990. The patient had firstly been diagnosed with cholecystitis and gallbladder neck stones, diet abstinence, metronidazole, cefoperazone sulbactam, and rehydration were given. The patient responded poorly to these empiric treatments. The patient was given moxifloxacin in combination with azithromycin after the onset of respiratory symptoms, but the condition continued to deteriorate, and tigecycline was subsequently added. After the mechanical ventilation and the treatment plan adjusting, she improved significantly.
CONCLUSION: Immunocompromised patient combined with underlying diseases are more susceptible to infection in an environment contaminated with Legionella, and the rapid onset and atypical respiratory symptoms make it easy to misdiagnose the disease, thus delaying treatment and leading to further deterioration. Timely diagnosis, early mechanical ventilation and rational drug administration were fundamental to treat Legionella pneumonia.","['Fan FF', 'Yu X', 'Shuai ZW', 'Hu XY', 'Pang M', 'Shi YW']",2023,16,,Infect Drug Resist,"Fan FF, et al.

36673091,Clinical and Laboratory Diagnosis of Legionella Pneumonia.,"Legionella pneumonia is a relatively rare but extremely progressive pulmonary infection with high mortality. Traditional cultural isolation remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia. However, its harsh culture conditions, long turnaround time, and suboptimal sensitivity do not meet the clinical need for rapid and accurate diagnosis, especially for critically ill patients. So far, pathogenic detection techniques including serological assays, urinary antigen tests, and mass spectrometry, as well as nucleic acid amplification technique, have been developed, and each has its own advantages and limitations. This review summarizes the clinical characteristics and imaging findings of Legionella pneumonia, then discusses the advances, advantages, and limitations of the various pathogenetic detection techniques used for Legionella pneumonia diagnosis. The aim is to provide rapid and accurate guiding options for early identification and diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia in clinical practice, further easing healthcare burden.","['Bai L', 'Yang W', 'Li Y']",2023,13,2,Diagnostics (Basel),"Bai L, et al.

36648206,Recurrent and atypical immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis.,"INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is a monoclonal antibody against the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor on lymphocytes, which is one of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) approved for multiple solid and hematologic malignancies. Although ICIs have proven to be more effective and less toxic compared to chemotherapy, there are reports of adverse side effects with ICIs. For example, pneumonitis is a potentially lethal side effect occurring in 1%-5% of patients who received ICIs in clinical trials, and there are case reports with clinical and radiological features of checkpoint inhibitor-pneumonitis (CIP).
CASE REPORT: We report an unusual case of pneumonitis with atypical imaging in a patient who received pembrolizumab for metastatic p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue. We discuss the approach to the recognition and management of atypical CIP in patients on pembrolizumab with the intent to standardize workup and increase awareness among healthcare providers in the new era of immunotherapy.
MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Serologic workup including laboratory studies for complete blood count (CBC), lactate, procalcitonin, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Legionella, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Coccidioides, Coxiella, and viral respiratory panel were negative for infectious processes. Since CIP was suspected, the patient was started on steroid therapy. Interval computed tomography (CT) of the chest without contrast showed a resolution of pneumonitis.
DISCUSSION: In this case report, we discuss our workup of CIP and initial testing to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings, and management of the patient's diagnosis of atypical CIP which led to complete clinical recovery from CIP.","['Jeon WJ', 'Nguyen J', 'Castillo DR', 'Park K', 'Brothers J', 'Nguyen A', 'Mirshahidi H']",2023,29,5,J Oncol Pharm Pract,"Jeon WJ, et al.

Due to the clinical similarity of Covid-19 with other flulike syndromes, patients are assayed for other pathogens of influenza like illness. There have been reported cases of co-infection amongst patients with Covid-19. Bacteria for example Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila etc and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus etc are identified as co-pathogens. In our current effort, we develop and analysed a compartmental based Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) type mathematical model to understand the co-infection dynamics of Covid-19 and other influenza type illness. In this work we have incorporated the saturated treatment rate to take account of the impact of limited treatment resources to control the possible Covid-19 cases.

The objective of this work was to describe the experience in the LD laboratory diagnostic approach in Argentina during the period 2016-2021. The laboratory analyzed 168 clinical specimens from 93 cases of suspected LD pneumonia. Laboratory tests included the detection of the soluble antigen of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 in urine sample, detection of DNA of Legionella spp. in lower respiratory secretions by conventional and commercial molecular methods and isolation in selective medium. LD was confirmed in 12 patients. The urinary antigen allowed the diagnosis for 8 patients. L. pneumophila was isolated from the respiratory material of 6 patients suffering from health care-associated pneumonia, who had been previously diagnosed using the commercial molecular method. Fifty percent of these cases did not show detectable urinary antigen. A single patient did not shows neither detectable antigenuria nor isolation of Legionella from the respiratory sample and was diagnosed as a confirmed case of LD by the detection of DNA of Legionella spp. by PCR directly from the respiratory secretion and the epidemiological link with another case of confirmed LD by culture. Urinary antigen detection is the first-line diagnostic test. However, the incorporation of complementary molecular methods has proved to avoid false negatives and contributed to a better understanding of the true incidence of the disease.","['Cipolla L', 'Rocca F', 'Armitano R', 'López B', 'Prieto M']",2023,55,2,Rev Argent Microbiol,"Cipolla L, et al.

Compared to the surrounding water, microbial community composition associated with the plastisphere is known to differ with functional consequences. Here, this study characterized the bacterial and fungal communities associated with four types of plastisphere (polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride) in an estuarine habitat; assessed ecological functions including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling, and determined the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and human pathogens. Stochastic processes dominated the community assembly of microorganisms on the plastisphere. Several functional genera related to nutrient cycling were enriched in the plastisphere. Compared to surrounding water and other plastisphere, the abundances of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling genes (cdaR, nosZ and chpy etc.) and ARGs (aadA2-1, cfa and catB8 etc.) were significantly increased in polyvinyl chloride plastisphere. In contrast, the polystyrene plastisphere was the preferred substrate for several pathogens being enriched with for example, Giardia lamblia 18S rRNA, Klebsiella pneumoniae phoE and Legionella spp. 23S rRNA. Overall, this study showed that different plastisphere had different effects on ecological functions and health risk in estuaries and emphasizes the importance of controlling plastic pollution in estuaries.

36573676,Diversity and dynamics of bacterial communities in the drinking water distribution network of a mid-sized city in Brazil.,"This study assessed the bacterial community composition of a drinking water system (DWS) serving a mid-sized city (120,000 inhabitants) in Brazil. Water samples, including raw and treated water, were collected at seven points throughout the DWS. DNA was extracted and analysed using high-throughput sequencing (Ion Torrent). Free chlorine and turbidity were measured in situ. Results showed that the highest relative abundance of 16S rRNA genes was from phyla Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The next most abundant phylum was Cyanobacteria, represented by Arthronema, Calothrix, and Synechococcus. An interesting observation was that the DNA-based analysis suggested a bacterial community change in the distribution network, with treated reservoir water being very different from the network samples. This suggests active microbiology within the distribution network and a tendency for bacterial diversity to decrease after chlorine disinfection but increase after pipeline distribution. In raw water, a predominance of Proteobacteria was observed with reduced Cyanobacteria, showing a negative correlation. In treated water, Proteobacteria were negatively correlated with Bacteroidetes. Finally, 16S rRNA genes from Firmicutes (especially Staphylococcus) had a high abundance in the chlorinated water, which may indicate the phylum's resistance to chlorine residuals. Opportunistic pathogens, e.g., Mycobacteria, Legionella, and Staphylococcus, were also observed.","['Batista AMM', 'Siqueira JC', 'Meynet P', 'Werner D', 'Garcia GPP', 'Davenport RJ', 'Pereira AD', 'Siniscalchi LAB', 'Araújo JC', 'Mota Filho CR']",2022,20,12,J Water Health,"Batista AMM, et al.

METHODS: Prospective diagnostic accuracy study (2014-2017) at three university hospitals in Austria.
RESULTS: A total of 996 patients were included in the study. Legionellosis was diagnosed in 49/996 (4.9%) using the reference test. The sensitivity and specificity of the Coris test were 75.5% (95% CI 61.1-86.7%) and 100% (95%CI 99.6-100%), respectively. The PPV was 100% and when using the lower 95% CI limit of the estimate for sensitivity, the resulting PPV was 61.1%. The NPV was 98.7% and the accuracy was 98.8%. The index test showed a PPV > 97% during the period of summer and autumn (May through November) and ≥88% during winter (December through February). The NPV was >97% during all of the periods. The median of the monthly incidence in the general population was 0.1 per 100,000 (IQR 0.1; 0.3).
CONCLUSION: The new rapid test gave a high level of diagnostic accuracy in a rapid fashion.

36543987,Contribution of pollution gradient to the sediment microbiome and potential pathogens in urban streams draining into Lake Victoria (Kenya).,"In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), urban rivers/streams have long been subjected to anthropogenic pollution caused by urbanization, resulting in significantly altered chemical and biological properties of surface water and sediments. However, little is known about the diversity and structure of river microbial community composition and pathogens, as well as how they respond to anthropogenic inputs. High-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and PICRUSt predictive function profiling were used in this study to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the spatial bacterial distribution and metabolic functions in sediment of two urban streams (Kisat and Auji) flowing through Kisumu City, Kenya. Results revealed that sediment samples from the highly urbanized mid and lower stream catchment zones of both streams had significantly higher levels of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP) than the less urbanized upper catchment zone, and were severely polluted with toxic heavy metals lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu). Differential distribution of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobia in sediment bacterial composition was detected along stream catchment zones. The polluted mid and lower catchment zones were rich in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, as well as a variety of potential pathogenic taxa such as Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium, Turicella, Acinetobacter, and Micrococcus, as well as enteric bacteria such as Faecalibacterium, Shewanella, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Prevotella, Legionella, Vibrio and Salmonella. Furthermore, PICRUSt metabolic inference analysis revealed an increasing enrichment in the sediments of genes associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism, disease pathogenesis, and virulence. Environmental factors (TOC, Pb, Cd, TN, pH) and geographical distance as significant drivers of sediment bacterial community assembly, with the environmental selection to play a dominant role. In polluted river catchment zone sediment samples, Pb content was the most influential sediment property, followed by TOC and Cd content. Given the predicted increase in urbanization in SSA, further alteration of surface water and sediment microbiome due to urban river pollution is unavoidable, with potential long-term effects on ecosystem function and potential health hazards. As a result, this study provides valuable information for ecological risk assessment and management of urban rivers impacted by diffuse and point source anthropogenic inputs, which is critical for future proactive and sustainable urban waste management, monitoring, and water pollution control in low-income countries.","['Odhiambo KA', 'Ogola HJO', 'Onyango B', 'Tekere M', 'Ijoma GN']",2023,30,13,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Odhiambo KA, et al.

36538933,Mechanism of Lys6 poly-ubiquitin specificity by the L. pneumophila deubiquitinase LotA.,"The versatility of ubiquitination to control vast domains of eukaryotic biology is due, in part, to diversification through differently linked poly-ubiquitin chains. Deciphering signaling roles for some chain types, including those linked via K6, has been stymied by a lack of specificity among the implicated regulatory proteins. Forged through strong evolutionary pressures, pathogenic bacteria have evolved intricate mechanisms to regulate host ubiquitin during infection. Herein, we identify and characterize a deubiquitinase domain of the secreted effector LotA from Legionella pneumophila that specifically regulates K6-linked poly-ubiquitin. We demonstrate the utility of LotA for studying K6 poly-ubiquitin signals. We identify the structural basis of LotA activation and poly-ubiquitin specificity and describe an essential ""adaptive"" ubiquitin-binding domain. Without LotA activity during infection, the Legionella-containing vacuole becomes decorated with K6 poly-ubiquitin as well as the AAA ATPase VCP/p97/Cdc48. We propose that LotA's deubiquitinase activity guards Legionella-containing vacuole components from ubiquitin-dependent extraction.","['Warren GD', 'Kitao T', 'Franklin TG', 'Nguyen JV', 'Geurink PP', 'Kubori T', 'Nagai H', 'Pruneda JN']",2023,83,1,Mol Cell,"Warren GD, et al.

36529135,Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 infection associated with the use of an apartment building spa pool.,"BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease is a notifiable condition in New South Wales (NSW), Australia; clinicians and laboratories are required to report the disease to NSW Health. We describe the investigation of a sporadic case associated with the use of a communal spa pool in the case's apartment building complex and the use of whole genome sequencing to examine relatedness between clinical and environmental Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) strains.
METHODS: In February 2018, a confirmed case of Lp1 infection was notified in a man in his 60s hospitalised with pneumonia. We asked the clinical team to obtain sputum in the event we found a potential source. The case described the use of the communal spa pool in his apartment building on two occasions during the putative exposure period. Environmental Health Officers from the Public Health Unit inspected the spa pool and found that the free chlorine level was well below the recommended concentration; a water sample was submitted for microbial analysis.
RESULTS: Lp1 was grown from the case's sputum and microbial analysis of the spa water sample found Lp1 at a concentration of 20 CFU/mL. The human and environmental isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing and found to be highly genomically related. There was no other plausible environmental source of legionella.
CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome sequencing of the clinical and environmental Lp1 isolates implicated a contaminated spa pool as the source of the case's exposure. This strongly supports the application of whole genome sequencing to the investigation of single cases of legionellosis. Communal spa pools in apartment buildings are not regulated in most Australian jurisdictions but must be considered to pose a potential legionella risk if improperly maintained.","['Cains T', 'Shalak H', 'Timms VJ', 'Kiss A', 'Smith A', 'Sintchenko V', 'Bateman-Steel C', 'Ferson MJ']",2022,46,,Commun Dis Intell (2018),"Cains T, et al.

36526881,Pan-kinome of Legionella expanded by a bioinformatics survey.,"The pathogenic Legionella bacteria are notorious for delivering numerous effector proteins into the host cell with the aim of disturbing and hijacking cellular processes for their benefit. Despite intensive studies, many effectors remain uncharacterized. Motivated by the richness of Legionella effector repertoires and their oftentimes atypical biochemistry, also by several known atypical Legionella effector kinases and pseudokinases discovered recently, we undertook an in silico survey and exploration of the pan-kinome of the Legionella genus, i.e., the union of the kinomes of individual species. In this study, we discovered 13 novel (pseudo)kinase families (all are potential effectors) with the use of non-standard bioinformatic approaches. Together with 16 known families, we present a catalog of effector and non-effector protein kinase-like families within Legionella, available at http://bioinfo.sggw.edu.pl/kintaro/ . We analyze and discuss the likely functional roles of the novel predicted kinases. Notably, some of the kinase families are also present in other bacterial taxa, including other pathogens, often phylogenetically very distant from Legionella.

36496059,Development and evaluation of the Galleria mellonella (greater wax moth) infection model to study Brucella host-pathogen interaction.,"Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Brucella. These pathogens cause long-lasting infections, a process in which Brucella modifications in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and envelope lipids reduce pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition, thus hampering innate immunity activation. In vivo models are essential to investigate bacterial virulence, mice being the most used model. However, ethical and practical considerations impede their use in high-throughput screening studies. Although lacking the complexity of the mammalian immune system, insects share key-aspects of innate immunity with mammals, and Galleria mellonella has been used increasingly as a model. G. mellonella larvae have been shown useful in virulence analyses, including Gram-negative pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. To assess its potential to study Brucella virulence, we first evaluated larva survival upon infection with representative Brucella species (i.e.B. abortus 2308W, B. microti CCM4915 and B. suis biovar 2) and mutants in the VirB type-IV secretion system (T4SS) or in the LPS-O-polysaccharide (O-PS). As compared to K.pneumoniae, the Brucella spp. tested induced a delayed and less severe mortality profile consistent with an escape of innate immunity detection. Brucella replication within larvae was affected by the lack of O-PS, which is reminiscent of their attenuation in natural hosts. On the contrary, replication was not affected by T4SS dysfunction and the mutant induced only slightly less mortality (not statistically significant) than its parental strain. We also evaluated G. mellonella to efficiently recognise Brucella and their LPS by quantification of the pro-phenoloxidase system and melanisation activation, using Pseudomonas LPS as a positive control. Among the brucellae, only B. microti LPS triggered an early-melanisation response consistent with the slightly increased endotoxicity of this species in mice. Therefore, G. mellonella represents a tool to screen for potential Brucella factors modulating innate immunity, but its usefulness to investigate other mechanisms relevant in Brucella intracellular life is limited.","['Elizalde-Bielsa A', 'Aragón-Aranda B', 'Loperena-Barber M', 'Salvador-Bescós M', 'Moriyón I', 'Zúñiga-Ripa A', 'Conde-Álvarez R']",2023,174,,Microb Pathog,"Elizalde-Bielsa A, et al.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: According to current knowledge about legionella transmission, healthcare workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of exposure. The aim of this research was to systematically review the literature about HCWs' exposure to legionella and establish whether there is an occupational risk.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched to identify studies regarding the occupational risk of legionellosis for HCWs. Keywords used in the search were 'Legionella pneumophila', 'occupational medicine', 'occupational' and 'risk'. Selected studies were reviewed to assess the quality and meta-analysed. Finally, the nine epidemiological principles of Bradford-Hill criteria were used to assess whether legionellosis could be considered an occupational risk for HCWs.
RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 124 studies, and 10 studies were included in the present review. The overall study quality was low. The pooled odds ratio estimate was 2.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.52-3.96). The assessment using Bradford-Hill criteria showed that only two criteria (plausibility and coherence) were met, which is insufficient to establish an occupational risk.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that there is a higher risk of legionella exposure for HCWs, but there is currently no clinical evidence. Further studies with appropriate study design are needed to determine whether legionella infection is an occupational risk for HCWs.","['Bongiovanni A', 'Colazingari V', 'Messineo A', 'Del Cimmuto A', 'De Giusti M', 'La Torre G']",2023,214,,Public Health,"Bongiovanni A, et al.

However, there is still room for improvement to accomplish this goal. Many randomized controlled trials have reported that procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antimicrobial therapy could help to reduce antibiotic consumption without negative health effects, specifically in acute respiratory infections. In September 2018, some experts in Europe and the USA proposed algorithms for PCT-guided antimicrobial therapy in mild to moderate infection cases outside the ICU and severe cases in the ICU (the international experts consensus). Thereafter, a group of Japanese experts, including specialists in intensive care medicine, emergency medicine, respiratory medicine and infectious diseases, created a modified version of a PCT-guided algorithm (Japanese experts consensus). This modified algorithm was adapted to better fit Japanese medical circumstances, since PCT-guided therapy is not widely used in daily clinical practice in Japan.

36427489,Inflammasome activation and CCR2-mediated monocyte-derived dendritic cell recruitment restrict Legionella pneumophila infection.,"Flagellin-induced NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis are critical events restricting Legionella pneumophila infection. However, the cellular and molecular dynamics of the in vivo responses against this bacterium are still unclear. We have found temporal coordination of two independent innate immunity pathways in controlling Legionella infection, the inflammasome activation and the CCR2-mediated Mo-DC recruitment. Inflammasome activation was an important player at the early stage of infection by lowering the numbers of bacteria for an efficient bacterial clearance conferred by the Mo-DC at the late stage of the infection. Mo-DC emergence highly depended on CCR2-signaling and dispensed inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. Also, Mo-DC compartment did not rely on the inflammasome machinery to deliver proper immune responses and was the most abundant cytokine-producing among the monocyte-derived cells in the infected lung. Importantly, when the CCR2- and NLRC4-dependent axes of response were simultaneously ablated, we observed an aggravated bacterial burden in the lung of infected mice. Taken together, we showed that inflammasome activation and CCR2-mediated immune response interplay in distinct pathways to restrict pulmonary bacterial infection. These findings extend our understanding of the in vivo integration and cooperation of different innate immunity arms in controlling infectious agents.","['Ataide MA', 'Manin GZ', 'Oliveira SS', 'Guerra RO', 'Zamboni DS']",2023,53,2,Eur J Immunol,"Ataide MA, et al.

This is a case of a previously healthy 44-year-old man who was diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia causing acute kidney failure and rhabdomyolysis.
CASE REPORT: The patient presented with four days of chills, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, diarrhea, and myalgias. Laboratory testing revealed hyponatremia, leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, received a course of antibiotics, and more than two weeks of intermittent hemodialysis with full recovery of renal function. The pathophysiologic mechanisms by which Legionella causes rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney failure are not fully understood, although numerous mechanisms have been proposed including direct invasion of myocytes and renal tubular cells.

36423850,"Effects of temperature and light exposure on the decay characteristics of fecal indicators, norovirus, and Legionella in mesocosms simulating subarctic river water.","Knowledge of the decay characteristics of health-related microbes in surface waters is important for modeling the transportation of waterborne pathogens and for assessing their public health risks. Although water temperature and light exposure are major factors determining the decay characteristics of enteric microbes in surface waters, such effects have not been well studied in subarctic surface waters. This study comprehensively evaluated the effect of temperature and light on the decay characteristics of health-related microbes [Escherichia coli, enterococci, microbial source tracking markers (GenBac3 & HF183 assays), coliphages (F-specific and somatic), noroviruses GII and Legionella spp.] under simulated subarctic river water conditions. The experiments were conducted in four different laboratory settings (4 °C/dark, 15 °C/dark, 15 °C/light, and 22 °C/light). The T90 values (time required for a 90 % reduction in the population of a target) of all targets were higher under cold and dark (2.6-51.3 days depending upon targets) than under warm and light conditions (0.6-3.5 days). Under 4 °C/dark (simulated winter) water conditions, F-specific coliphages had 27.2 times higher, and coliform bacteria had 3.3 times higher T90 value than under 22 °C/light (simulated summer) water conditions. Bacterial molecular markers also displayed high variation in T90 values, with the greatest difference between 4 °C/dark and 22 °C/light recorded for HF183 DNA (20.6 times) and the lowest difference for EC23S857 RNA (6.6 times). E. coli, intestinal enterococci, and somatic coliphages were relatively more sensitive to light than water temperature, but F-specific coliphages, norovirus, and all bacterial rDNA and rRNA markers were relatively more sensitive to temperature than light exposure. Due to the slow microbial decay in winter under subarctic conditions, the microbial quality of river water might remain low for a long time after a sewage spill. This increased risk associated with fecal pollution during winter may deserve more attention, especially when river waters are used for drinking water production.","['Tiwari A', 'Kauppinen A', 'Räsänen P', 'Salonen J', 'Wessels L', 'Juntunen J', 'Miettinen IT', 'Pitkänen T']",2023,859,Pt 2,Sci Total Environ,"Tiwari A, et al.

36421640,"Serostatus and Epidemiological Characteristics for Atypical Pneumonia Causative Bacteria among Healthy Individuals in Medina, Saudi Arabia, a Retrospective Study.","Background: Community-acquired atypical pneumonia is generally a mild and self-limiting infection. Still, it may lead to hospitalization and progressive clinical complications in some cases, particularly among the elderly and individuals with chronic diseases. Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are the community’s main causative agents of atypical pneumonia. However, most published studies evaluated their incidence in the hospital setting, and little is known about their prevalence among healthy individuals. This work aims to assess the seroprevalence of these bacteria among healthy people to determine the status of immunity against these bacteria in the community. Methodology: Two hundred and eighty-three serum samples from a multicenter in Medina, Saudi Arabia, were collected in this study. Serum samples were subjected to indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect IgG antibodies against C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, and M. pneumoniae to investigate the seroprevalence of these bacteria and their distribution among different genders and age groups of healthy people. Results: IgG seropositivity for at least one of the three atypical pneumonia-causative bacteria occurred in 85.8% (n= 243/283) of the sample population. IgG seropositivity for C. pneumoniae occurred in 80.6% (228/283) of the population, followed by 37.5% for L. pneumophila and 23% for M. pneumoniae (66/283). In addition, the IgG seropositivity rates for the three bacteria were observed predominantly among male participants. Furthermore, no significant difference in IgG seropositivity distribution occurred between different age groups of healthy people for C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila and M. pneumoniae. Conclusions: The current study found that C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, and M. pneumoniae tended to be highly prevalent among healthy people and more common among males than females. Additionally, their pattern of distribution among healthy individuals seemed to be predominant among young adults (aged 20−40 years), which differs from their predominant distribution among elderly patients in hospital settings (>50 years).","['Alhoufie ST', 'Alhhazmi AA', 'Mahallawi WH', 'Alfarouk KO', 'Ibrahim NA']",2022,10,11,Healthcare (Basel),"Alhoufie ST, et al.

36410491,Metagenomics reveals the response of antibiotic resistance genes to elevated temperature in the Yellow River.,"Climate warming may aggravate the threat of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to environmental and human health. However, whether temperature can predict ARGs and influence their assembly processes remains unknown. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to explore how gradually elevated water temperature (23 °C, 26 °C, 29 °C, 32 °C, 35 °C) influences ARG and mobile genetic element (MGE) profiles in the Yellow River. In total, 30 ARG types including 679 subtypes were detected in our water samples. Gradually increased temperature remarkably reduced ARG diversity but increased ARG abundance. Approximately 37 % of ARGs and 42 % of MGEs were predicted by temperature, while most others were not sensitive to temperature. For each 1 °C increase in temperature, the ARG abundance rose by 2133 TPM (Transcripts Per kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) abundance, and multidrug, tetracycline and peptide resistance genes had the fastest increases. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the primary ARG hosts, with 558 and 226 ARG subtypes, respectively. Although ARG profiles were mainly governed by stochastic process, elevated temperature increased the deterministic process of ARGs in the Yellow River. The abundance of five high-risk ARGs (tetM, mecA, bacA, vatE and tetW) significantly increased with elevated water temperature, and these ARGs co-occurred with several opportunistic pathogens (Delftia, Legionella and Pseudomonas), implying that antibiotic resistance risk may increase under climate warming. Our study explored the possibility of predicting resistomes and their health risks through temperature, providing a novel approach to predict and control ARGs in water environments under climate warming.","['Yu Q', 'Han Q', 'Shi S', 'Sun X', 'Wang X', 'Wang S', 'Yang J', 'Su W', 'Nan Z', 'Li H']",2023,859,Pt 2,Sci Total Environ,"Yu Q, et al.

Here, we investigate the structural basis for RNA recognition by ProQ/FinO proteins, through the crystal structure of the ProQ/FinO domain of the Legionella pneumophila DNA uptake regulator, RocC, bound to the transcriptional terminator of its primary partner, the sRNA RocR. The structure reveals specific recognition of the 3' nucleotide of the terminator by a conserved pocket involving a β-turn-α-helix motif, while the hairpin portion of the terminator is recognized by a conserved α-helical N-cap motif. Structure-guided mutagenesis reveals key RNA contact residues that are critical for RocC/RocR to repress the uptake of environmental DNA in L. pneumophila. Structural analysis and RNA binding studies reveal that other ProQ/FinO domains also recognize related transcriptional terminators with different specificities for the length of the 3' ssRNA tail.","['Kim HJ', 'Black M', 'Edwards RA', 'Peillard-Fiorente F', 'Panigrahi R', 'Klingler D', 'Eidelpes R', 'Zeindl R', 'Peng S', 'Su J', 'Omar AR', 'MacMillan AM', 'Kreutz C', 'Tollinger M', 'Charpentier X', 'Attaiech L', 'Glover JNM']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Kim HJ, et al.

A prospective observational cohort study of consecutive 341 hospitalized adults with CAP was performed between January 2018 and March 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, symptoms/signs, analytical data, severity scores, antimicrobials, and outcomes were recorded. Blood, NP swabs, sputum, and urine samples were collected at admission and assayed by multiplex real time-PCR, bacterial cultures, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila antigens detection, to determine the etiologies and quantify the viral load. The etiology was identified in 174 (51.0%) patients, and in 85 (24.9%) it was viral, the most frequent rhinovirus and influenza virus. The sensitivity of viral detection in sputum (50.7%) was higher than in NP swabs (20.9%). Compared with sputum, the positive predictive value and specificity of NP swabs for viral diagnosis were 95.8% and 96.9%, respectively. Performance of PSI and CURB-65 scores in all CAP with etiologic diagnosis were as expected, with mortality associated with higher values, but they were not associated with mortality in patients with viral pneumonia. NP swabs have lower sensitivity but high specificity for the diagnosis of viral CAP in adults compared with sputum, reinforcing the use NP swabs for the diagnostic etiology work-up. The PSI and CURB-65 scores did not predict mortality in the viral CAP, suggesting that they need to be updated scores based on the identification of the etiological agent.","['Berastegui-Cabrera J', 'Aguilar-Guisado M', 'Crespo-Rivas JC', 'López-Verdugo M', 'Merino L', 'Escoresca-Ortega A', 'Calero-Acuña C', 'Carrasco-Hernández L', 'Toral-Marín JI', 'Abad-Arranz M', 'Ramírez-Duque N', 'Barón-Franco B', 'Pachón J', 'Álvarez-Marín R', 'Sánchez-Céspedes J']",2023,95,1,J Med Virol,"Berastegui-Cabrera J, et al.

36330734,Incidence and risk factors associated with progression to severe pneumonia among adults with non-severe Legionella pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella species are important causative organisms of severe pneumonia. However, data are limited on predictors of progression to severe Legionella pneumonia (LP). Therefore, the risk factors for LP progression from non-severe to the severe form were investigated in the present study.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that included adult LP patients admitted to a 2,700-bed referral center between January 2005 and December 2019.
RESULTS: A total of 155 patients were identified during the study period; 58 patients (37.4%) initially presented with severe pneumonia and 97 (62.6%) patients with non-severe pneumonia. Among the 97 patients, 28 (28.9%) developed severe pneumonia during hospitalization and 69 patients (71.1%) recovered without progression to severe pneumonia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed platelet count ≤150,000/mm3 (odds ratio [OR], 2.923; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.100-8.105; P=0.034) and delayed antibiotic treatment >1 day (OR, 3.092; 95% CI, 1.167-8.727; P=0.026) were significant independent factors associated with progression to severe pneumonia.

36321832,5' Untranslated mRNA Regions Allow Bypass of Host Cell Translation Inhibition by Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila grows within membrane-bound vacuoles in alveolar macrophages during human disease. Pathogen manipulation of the host cell is driven by bacterial proteins translocated through a type IV secretion system (T4SS). Although host protein synthesis during infection is arrested by the action of several of these translocated effectors, translation of a subset of host proteins predicted to restrict the pathogen is maintained. To identify the spectrum of host proteins selectively synthesized after L. pneumophila challenge, macrophages infected with the pathogen were allowed to incorporate the amino acid analog azidohomoalanine (AHA) during a 2-h time window, and newly synthesized macrophage proteins were isolated by orthogonal chemistry followed by mass spectrometry. Among the proteins isolated were interferon-stimulated genes as well as proteins translated from highly abundant transcripts. Surprisingly, a large number of the identified proteins were from low-abundance transcripts. These proteins were predicted to be among the most efficiently translated per unit transcript in the cell based on ribosome profiling data sets. To determine if high ribosome loading was a consequence of efficient translation initiation, the 5' untranslated regions (5' UTR) of transcripts having the highest and lowest predicted loading levels were inserted upstream of a reporter, and translation efficiency was determined in response to L. pneumophila challenge. The efficiency of reporter expression largely correlated with predicted ribosome loading and lack of secondary structure. Therefore, determinants in the 5' UTR allow selected host cell transcripts to overcome a pathogen-driven translation blockade.","['Lipo E', 'Asrat S', 'Huo W', 'Sol A', 'Fraser CS', 'Isberg RR']",2022,90,11,Infect Immun,"Lipo E, et al. 5' Untranslated mRNA Regions Allow Bypass of Host Cell Translation Inhibition by Legionella pneumophila. 5' Untranslated mRNA Regions Allow Bypass of Host Cell Translation Inhibition by Legionella pneumophila. 2022; 90:e0017922. doi: 10.1128/iai.00179-22",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36321832/

36270142,Molecular screening and characterization of Legionella pneumophila associated free-living amoebae in domestic and hospital water systems.,"Free-living amoebae are ubiquitous in the environment and cause both opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections in humans. Some genera of amoebae are natural reservoirs of opportunistic plumbing pathogens, such as Legionella pneumophila. In this study, the presence of free-living amoebae and Legionella was investigated in 140 water and biofilm samples collected from Australian domestic (n = 68) and hospital water systems (n = 72). Each sample was screened in parallel using molecular and culture-based methods. Direct quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays showed that 41% samples were positive for Legionella, 33% for L. pneumophila, 11% for Acanthamoeba, and 55% for Vermamoeba vermiformis gene markers. Only 7% of samples contained culturable L. pneumophila serogroup (sg)1, L. pneumophila sg2-14, and non-pneumophila Legionella. In total, 69% of samples were positive for free-living amoebae using any method. Standard culturing found that 41% of the samples were positive for amoeba (either Acanthamoeba, Allovahlkampfia, Stenamoeba, or V. vermiformis). V. vermiformis showed the highest overall frequency of occurrence. Acanthamoeba and V. vermiformis isolates demonstrated high thermotolerance and osmotolerance and strong broad spectrum bacteriogenic activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Importantly, all Legionella positive samples were also positive for amoeba, and this co-occurrence was statistically significant (p < 0.05). According to qPCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization, V. vermiformis and Allovahlkampfia harboured intracellular L. pneumophila. To our knowledge, this is the first time Allovahlkampfia and Stenamoeba have been demonstrated as hosts of L. pneumophila in potable water. These results demonstrate the importance of amoebae in engineered water systems, both as a pathogen and as a reservoir of Legionella. The high frequency of gymnamoebae detected in this study from Australian engineered water systems identifies an issue of significant public health concern. Future water management protocols should incorporate treatments strategies to control amoebae to reduce the risk to end users.","['Nisar MA', 'Ross KE', 'Brown MH', 'Bentham R', 'Hinds J', 'Whiley H']",2022,226,,Water Res,"Nisar MA, et al.

36251935,Triclosan Promotes Conjugative Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance Genes to Opportunistic Pathogens in Environmental Microbiome.,"Although triclosan, as a widely used antiseptic chemical, is known to promote the transmission of antibiotic resistance to diverse hosts in pure culture, it is still unclear whether and how triclosan could affect the transmission of broad-host-range plasmids among complex microbial communities. Here, bacterial culturing, fluorescence-based cell sorting, and high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were combined to investigate contributions of triclosan on the transfer rate and range of an IncP-type plasmid from a proteobacterial donor to an activated sludge microbiome. Our results demonstrate that triclosan significantly enhances the conjugative transfer of the RP4 plasmid among activated sludge communities at environmentally relevant concentrations. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing on sorted transconjugants demonstrates that triclosan not only promoted the intergenera transfer but also the intragenera transfer of the RP4 plasmid among activated sludge communities.

36240833,Epidemiological analysis of Legionnaires' disease in Scotland: a genomic study.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila is the main cause of a severe pneumonic illness known as Legionnaires' disease and is a global public health threat. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can be applied to trace environmental origins of L pneumophila infections, providing information to guide appropriate interventions. We aim to explore the evolutionary and epidemiological relationships in a 36-year Scottish L pneumophila reference isolate collection.
METHODS: We investigated the genomic epidemiology of Legionnaires' disease over 36 years in Scotland, comparing genome sequences for all clinical L pneumophila isolates (1984-2020) with a sequence dataset of 3211 local and globally representative isolates. We used a stratified clustering approach to capture epidemiological relationships by core genome Multi-locus Sequence Typing, followed by high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of clusters to measure diversity and evolutionary relatedness in context with epidemiological metadata.
FINDINGS: Clustering analysis showed that 111 (57·5 %) of 193 of L pneumophila infections in Scotland were caused by ten endemic lineages with a wide temporal and geographical distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of L pneumophila identified hospital-associated sublineages that had been detected in the hospital environment up to 19 years. Furthermore, 12 (30·0%) of 40 community-associated infections (excluding a single, large outbreak) that occurred over a 13 year period (from 2000 to 2013) were caused by a single widely distributed endemic clone (ST37), consistent with enhanced human pathogenicity. Finally, our analysis revealed clusters linked by national or international travel to distinct geographical regions, indicating several previously unrecognised travel links between closely related isolates (fewer than five single nucleotide polymorphisms) connected by geography.
INTERPRETATION: Our analysis reveals the existence of previously undetected endemic clones of L pneumophila that existed for many years in hospital, community, and travel-associated environments. In light of these findings, we propose that cluster and outbreak definitions should be reconsidered, and propose WGS-based surveillance as a critical public health tool for real-time identification and mitigation of clinically important endemic clones.

Therefore, monitoring and assessing Legionella in the environment and water distribution systems of such places are critical due to the prone population in hospitals. However, the health risks of Legionella bacteria in the environment are not adequately evaluated. In this study, for hospitalized patients, we performed a quantitative health risk assessment of Legionella in selected hospitals in Tehran city using two scenarios of shower and toilet faucet exposure. This study identified Legionella in 38 cases (38%) out of 100 samples collected from toilet faucets and showers in 8 hospitals. The information gathered was used for quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The microbial load transmitted by inhalation was calculated using the concentration of Legionella in water. Other exposure parameters (inhalation rate and exposure time) were obtained using information from other studies and the median length of hospital stay (3.6 days). The exponential model was used to estimate the risk of infection (γ = 0.06) due to Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) inhalation for each exposure event.

36168234,Bioaerosol and microbial exposures from residential evaporative coolers and their potential health outcomes: A review.,"Evaporative cooling is an energy efficient form of air conditioning in dry climates that functions by pulling hot, dry outdoor air across a wet evaporative pad. While evaporative coolers can help save energy, they also have the potential to influence human health. Studies have shown residential evaporative coolers may pull outdoor air pollutants into the home or contribute to elevated levels of indoor bioaerosols that may be harmful to health. There is also evidence that evaporative coolers can enable a diverse microbial environment that may confer early-life immunological protection against the development of allergies and asthma or exacerbate these same hypersensitivities. This review summarizes the current knowledge of bioaerosol and microbiological studies associated with evaporative coolers, focusing on harmful and potentially helpful outcomes from their use. We evaluate the effects of evaporative coolers on indoor bacterial endotoxins, fungal β-(1 → 3)-D-glucans, dust mite antigens, residential microbial communities, and Legionella pneumophila. To our knowledge, this is the first review to summarize and evaluate studies on the influence that evaporative coolers have on the bioaerosol and microbiological profile of homes. This brings to light a gap in the literature on evaporative coolers, which is the lack of data on health effects associated with their use.","['Johnston JD', 'Cowger AE', 'Weber KS']",2022,32,9,Indoor Air,"Johnston JD, et al.

36162645,Systematic active environmental surveillance successfully identified and controlled the Legionella contamination in the hospital.,"INTRODUCTION: Legionella disease can manifest as severe respiratory tract infection with a high mortality rate and is sometimes associated with a hospital outbreak by a contaminated water supply. A patient with breast cancer admitted about a month before. High fever was observed 18 days after admission and the Legionella antigen test showed the positive result.
METHODS: Due to the incidence of Legionella infection, we demonstrated the active surveillance of Legionella contamination in the entire hospital.
RESULTS: Cultures of her environmental samples revealed that hot water in two bathrooms were contaminated with Legionella. In our hospital, the hot water is heated and pumped up on the roof and distributed to each room. The contaminated bathrooms were related to the same plumbing. Therefore, we further collected samples throughout the hot water system. Legionella was not detected in the central part of the system. However, we detected Legionella in the hot water sampled from other five rooms, which were also associated with the same plumbing of the two bathrooms. The temperature and chlorine concentration of the hot water were not high enough to inactivate Legionella at the end of the plumbing. After the adjustment of the water temperature and chlorine concentration, Legionella became undetectable. Our prompt and active surveillance successfully identified the plumbing of the hot water system as the source of Legionella contamination and took precautions against future outbreaks.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of water temperature and chloride concentration at the end of the hot water circulation is important to prevent nosocomial Legionella disease.","['Nakade J', 'Nakamura Y', 'Katayama Y', 'Obata H', 'Takahashi Y', 'Zaimoku Y', 'Fujii Y', 'Iwata Y']",2023,29,1,J Infect Chemother,"Nakade J, et al.

The increase in cases is significant: from 6947 reports in 2015 to 11,298 in 2019. This is alarming as genus Legionella, which comprises a large group of bacteria inhabiting various aquatic systems, poses a serious threat to human health and life, since more than 20 species can cause legionellosis, with L. pneumophila being responsible for the majority of cases. The ability to colonize diverse ecosystems makes the eradication of these microorganisms difficult. A detailed understanding of the Legionella habitat may be helpful in the effective control of this pathogen. This paper provides an overview of Legionella environments in Europe: natural (lakes, groundwater, rivers, compost, soil) and anthropogenic (fountains, air humidifiers, water supply systems), and the role of Legionella spp. in nosocomial infections, which are potentially fatal for children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients.","['Kanarek P', 'Bogiel T', 'Breza-Boruta B']",2022,29,51,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Kanarek P, et al.

Quantitative detection can be achieved by detecting fluorescence signals excited by excitation light at a specific wavelength range. Therefore, the key to fluorescence detection is the stable control of the excitation light and the accurate acquisition of weak photoelectric signals. Moreover, to improve portability and instantaneity, devices are developing in miniaturization and integration. As the core of such devices, fluorescence detectors should also have these features.

36116719,Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and state of emergency declarations on the relative incidence of legionellosis and invasive pneumococcal disease in Japan.,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of many droplet-transmitted infections decreased due to increased mask-wearing and social distancing. Contrastingly, there has been concern that COVID-19 countermeasures, such as lockdowns, may increase legionellosis incidence via water stagnation. During the pandemic in Japan, four state of emergency declarations were imposed between 2020 and 2021, which makes it particularly suitable to test this hypothesis.
METHODS: We use country-level surveillance data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases to track the relative incidence of legionellosis compared to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, with a focus on the periods just after state of emergency declarations were lifted.
RESULTS: The absolute number of legionellosis and IPD cases decreased in 2020 and 2021 compared to previous years. The average relative incidence of legionellosis as well as the variance of the relative incidence significantly increased during the pandemic compared to previous years. There were no increases in the relative incidence of legionellosis during the periods immediately following emergency declaration liftings, but the relative incidence did increase considerably during the first two states of emergency.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 countermeasures appear more effective at decreasing the incidence of human-to-human transmitted infections, such as IPD, compared to environmentally-transmitted infections, such as legionellosis. Though no evidence was found to suggest that legionellosis cases increased after state of emergency declarations, public health efforts should continue to emphasize the importance of routine sanitation and water system maintenance to prevent water stagnation and Legionella spp. contamination.","['Ghaznavi C', 'Ishikane M', 'Yoneoka D', 'Tanoue Y', 'Kawashima T', 'Eguchi A', 'Nomura S']",2023,29,1,J Infect Chemother,"Ghaznavi C, et al.

METHODS: This is a retrospective review of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected adults admitted between 9th February and 10th May 2020. Demographics, critical care unit (CCU) admission, antibiotic prescribing and microbiology results within 10 days of COVID-19 diagnosis were analysed.
RESULTS: 1155 patients were identified. 32.9% (380) died. 12.4% (143) had positive microbiology. After excluding likely contaminants, 6.9% (80) had clinically significant microbiology. The most common organisms isolated from blood cultures were 
CONCLUSIONS: Positive microbiology in COVID-19 patients is uncommon. Antibiotic use was widespread, despite lack of microbiological evidence of co-infection. When present, positive microbiology was more likely due to gram negative bacteria. Current local clinical and antimicrobial guidelines have incorporated these findings and recommend against routine antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients.","['Pj T', 'I M', 'J U', 'A O']",2022,4,4,Infect Prev Pract,"Pj T, et al.

36060390,A Case of Legionella Pneumonia in an Older Patient Without Typical Exposure to a Susceptive Environment.,"Legionella pneumonia is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia that causes various clinical symptoms and is often difficult to diagnose. For the diagnosis, it is important to inquire about the patient's history of exposure to sewage or soil, although there are rare cases of Legionella pneumonia with no history of exposure. In this study, we present a case of Legionella pneumonia in a 72-year-old man with no history of wastewater exposure from public baths or other sources. The patient presented to our emergency department with fever, chills, and shivering. The antigen test of the urine for Legionella was negative, and chest radiography showed patchy infiltrates in the right lower lung field that was suspicious for pneumonia. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g/day) for right-sided pneumonia and was intubated on day 1 due to poor oxygenation and a tendency towards exacerbation to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The fever resolved after day 3 (36.4-36.9°C), and the patient was extubated on day 6. A positive sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Legionella deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (type 1) was performed on day 6, and levofloxacin and dexamethasone therapy was administered. After completing a 10-day course of levofloxacin, the patient's symptoms were cured. Although it is important to note the patient's background, symptoms, and information on the clinical course, including laboratory values, to include a diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia, it is impractical to suspect Legionella pneumonia in all patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and to administer new quinolone antimicrobials. However, it is important to re-evaluate the diagnosis and intervene in treatment when β-lactam antimicrobials are ineffective or when extrapulmonary symptoms are present, as in this case.","['Nakano Y', 'Saka K', 'Yamane F', 'Sano C', 'Ohta R']",2022,14,7,Cureus,"Nakano Y, et al.

METHOD AND RESULTS: Using qPCR, L. pneumophila and L. pneumophila Serogroup (Sg)1 were measured in hot water samples collected from 100 structures, consisting of 70 residences and 30 office buildings. The hot water samples collected from office buildings had a higher L. pneumophila detection frequency of 53% (16/30) than residences, with a 10
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the built environment influences L. pneumophila transport and fate. Residential plumbing could be a potential ""conduit"" for L. pneumophila exposure from a source upstream of the hot water environment. Both old and newly built office buildings had an equal probability of L. pneumophila contamination.

36047173,Evaluation of Legionella pneumophila SGUT Serotypes Isolated from Bath Water Using a Multiplex-PCR Serotyping Assay.,"Legionella pneumophila, the primary causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is classified into at least 15 serogroups (SGs). Before genotyping, serotyping is first performed to limit the sources of L. pneumophila infections that caused an outbreak. In addition to conventional assays using monoclonal or polyclonal antisera, serotyping using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) was recently developed for L. pneumophila. In this study, we applied the M-PCR system to 41 strains that remained to be SGUT (untypable) by slide agglutination tests among the 220 L. pneumophila strains isolated from bath water in Kobe City during 2016-2020, to determine SG-genotypes (SGg) by PCR amplification of the specific target gene of the SGs. Among the 41 SGUT strains, SGg4/10/14 was the most predominant (24/41, 58.5%), followed by SGg1 (7/41, 17.1%). Seven strains, except for the strains determined as SGg1, were identified as belonging to a single SGg by M-PCR serotyping (SGg5 [3/41, 7.3%], SGg8 [3/41, 7.3%], and SGg7 [1/41, 2.4%]). Furthermore, we found that the seven strains identified as SGg1 harbored particular genotypes. In conclusion, the M-PCR serotyping assay will be helpful for investigating the distribution of L. pneumophila in environmental and clinical settings.","['Komatsu S', 'Tanaka S', 'Nakanishi N']",2023,76,1,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Komatsu S, et al.

36038465,"Epidemiology and direct health care costs of hospitalised legionellosis in New Zealand, 2000-2020.","BACKGROUND: Legionellosis is a collective term used for disease caused by Legionella species which result in community and hospital acquired pneumonia worldwide. The aim of this analysis was to describe the epidemiology of legionellosis hospitalisations in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) over a 21-year period and quantify the health care costs.
METHOD: This study combined national legionellosis notification and hospital discharge data that were linked via the National Health Index (NHI) to provide a more complete dataset of hospitalised cases. The direct cost of hospital care was estimated by multiplying the diagnosis-related group cost-weight by the national price and inflating to 2020/2021 values.
RESULTS: There were 1479 records matched across notifications and discharge databases, including 990 with principal and 489 with additional diagnosis of legionellosis. Incidence rose to an average of 143 cases per annum for 2016-2020, a rate of 3·2/100,000. The median LOS was 6 days (IQR 4-13·5) with direct costs of $2·1 million per annum over that period. Rates were highest in those aged 65 years and above, male, and of European/Other ethnicity. Hospitalisations showed a peak in spring and summer.
CONCLUSION: The rate of hospitalised legionellosis in New Zealand rose from 2000 to 2015, largely reflecting improved diagnosis. This preventable disease results in substantial health care costs. Greater efforts are needed to identify and control sources of exposure. Surveillance could be improved by routine integration of notification and hospital discharge data.","['Graham FF', 'Baker MG']",2023,28,1,Infect Dis Health,"Graham FF and Baker MG.

36000381,Antimicrobial effects of automobile screen washes against Legionella pneumophila.,"AIMS: Legionella pneumophila (Lp), a human pathogen, has been detected in windscreen wiper fluid reservoirs (WWFRs) where commercial screen washes (CSWs) are commonly added. Limited information is available on CSWs against planktonic Lp; however, responses of sessile Lp and planktonic Lp pre-acclimated in nutrient-limited water to CSWs remain unknown. This study thus investigates the antibacterial effects of CSWs on sessile and starved planktonic Lp, in comparison with unstarved Lp.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Lp biofilms were produced on glass and WWFR materials of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP). Planktonic Lp with and without acclimation in tap water were prepared. Log reductions in cell counts averaged 0.4-5.0 for 10 brands of CSWs against sessile Lp and 1.0-3.9 and 0.9-4.9, respectively, against starved and unstarved planktonic Lp for five CSWs. Both biofilm formation and acclimation in tap water enhanced Lp resistance to CSWs. Significantly different log-reduction values among CSW brands were observed for sessile Lp on HDPE and planktonic Lp regardless of acclimation (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Biofilm formation, starvation acclimation and CSW brand are crucial factors influencing Lp response to CSWs.

35953866,Non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals promote conjugative plasmid transfer at a community-wide level.,"BACKGROUND: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a critical role in the spread of antibiotic resistance and the evolutionary shaping of bacterial communities. Conjugation is the most well characterized pathway for the spread of antibiotic resistance, compared to transformation and transduction. While antibiotics have been found to induce HGT, it remains unknown whether non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals can facilitate conjugation at a microbial community-wide level.
RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that several commonly consumed non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (including carbamazepine, ibuprofen, naproxen and propranolol), at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.5 mg/L), can promote the conjugative transfer of IncP1-α plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance across entire microbial communities. The over-generation of reactive oxygen species in response to these non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals may contribute to the enhanced conjugation ratios. Cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses indicated that non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals modulate transconjugant microbial communities at both phylum and genus levels. Moreover, microbial uptake ability of the IncP1-α plasmid was also upregulated under non-antibiotic pharmaceutical exposure. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Acinetobacter and Legionella, were more likely to acquire the plasmid conferring multidrug resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high possibility of co-occurrence of pathogenic bacteria, conjugative IncP1-α plasmids and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in various environments (e.g., activated sludge systems), our findings illustrate the potential risk associated with increased dissemination of antibiotic resistance promoted by non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in complex environmental settings.

The components of T4SSs in gram-negative bacteria are organized into several large subassemblies: an inner membrane complex, an outer membrane core complex, and, in some species, an extracellular pilus. Cryo-electron tomography has been used to define the structures of T4SSs in intact bacteria, and high-resolution structural models are now available for isolated core complexes from conjugation systems, the Xanthomonas citri T4SS, the Helicobacter pylori Cag T4SS, and the Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm T4SS. In this review, we compare the molecular architectures of these T4SSs, focusing especially on the structures of core complexes. We discuss structural features that are shared by multiple T4SSs as well as evolutionary strategies used for T4SS diversification.

35902990,Phosphate drinking water softeners promote Legionella growth.,"Phosphate-based drinking water softeners are commonly used to prevent scale formation in drinking water distribution infrastructure. The main reason for drinking water softening is primarily economic (protection of pipes and extension of equipment life), while the health aspect of such treatment is usually neglected. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of phosphate-based drinking water softeners on growth stimulation of Legionella pneumophila. Bacterial growth was observed at two different phosphate concentrations. On average, an increase in growth of 1.19-1.28 log CFU/mL was observed in selected samples with added phosphates compared with the control. The results of the in vitro experiment confirmed that the added phosphates stimulate the growth of L. pneumophila; growth stimulation could therefore be expected in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) when phosphates are used as well. The availability of phosphorus in DWDS may be a crucial limiting factor for biofouling control. Consequently, phosphate-based chemicals for drinking water should be avoided or used with prudence, especially in drinking water with high concentrations of other nutrients.","['Jereb G', 'Eržen I', 'Oder M', 'Poljšak B']",2022,20,7,J Water Health,"Jereb G, et al.

35890033,Evaluation of a Most Probable Number Method for Detection and Quantification of Legionella pneumophila.,"The detection and enumeration of Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) in water is crucial for water quality management, human health and has been a research hotspot worldwide. Due to the time-consuming and complicated operation of the plate culture method, it is necessary to adopt a fast and effective method for application. The present study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the performance and applicability of the MPN method by comparing its qualitative and quantitative results with the GB/T 18204.5-2013 and ISO methods, respectively. The qualitative results showed that 372 samples (53%) were negative for both methods; 315 samples (45%) were positively determined by the MPN method, compared with 211 samples (30%) using GB/T 18204.5-2013. The difference in the detection rate between the two methods was statistically significant. In addition, the quantitative results showed that the concentration of L. pneumophila by the MPN method was greater than ISO 11731 and the difference was statistically significant. However, the two methods were different but highly correlated (r = 0.965, p < 0.001). The specificity and sensitivity of the MPN method were 89.85% and 95.73%, respectively. Overall, the results demonstrated that the MPN method has higher sensitivity, a simple operation process and good application prospects in the routine monitoring of L. pneumophila from water samples.","['Niu C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y']",2022,11,7,Pathogens,"Niu C, et al.

At least 70 species are described so far but few are identified in pathogenic conditions. Data on extrapulmonary infections are scarce.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-yar-old male with chronic lymphoid leukemia was hospitalized for an insidious wrist arthritis. Ultrasound of the wrist showed a carpal and radiocarpal fluid effusion with positive Doppler signal. While routine bacterial cultures remained sterile, 16S rRNA PCR identified Legionella anisa. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for a period of six weeks improved arthritis with full recovery at the end of the treatment.

35849524,Hospital water as the source of healthcare-associated infection and antimicrobial-resistant organisms.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Drinking water is considered one of the most overlooked and underestimated sources of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Recently, the prevention and control of opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens (OPPPs) in healthcare water systems has been receiving increasing attention in infection control guidelines. However, these fail to address colonization of pathogens that do not originate from source water. Subsequently, this review explores the role of water and premise plumbing biofilm in HAIs. The potential mechanisms of contamination and transmission of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens originating both from supply water and human microbiota are discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: OPPPs, such as Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium avium have been described as native to the plumbing environment. However, other pathogens, not found in the source water, have been found to proliferate in biofilms formed on outlets devices and cause HAI outbreaks.
SUMMARY: Biofilms formed on outlet devices, such as tap faucets, showers and drains provide an ideal niche for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Thus, comprehensive surveillance guidelines are required to understand the role that drinking water and water-related devices play in the transmission of AMR HAIs and to improve infection control guidelines.","['Hayward C', 'Brown MH', 'Whiley H']",2022,35,4,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Hayward C, et al.

Reduction of the strain farming puts on local surface or groundwater is vital for ensuring resilience in the face of climate change, and one possible option is to irrigate with a combination of freshwater and reclaimed water from municipal wastewater treatment facilities. However, this wastewater can contain pathogens that are harmful to human health, such as Legionella pneumophila, which is a bacterium that can survive aerosolization and airborne transportation and cause severe pneumonia when inhaled. To assess an individual adult's risk of infection with L. pneumophila from a single exposure to agricultural spray irrigation, a quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted for a scenario of spray irrigation in central Illinois, for the growing seasons in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

CASE REPORT A 44-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital following the presentation of dyspnea for a few days. Chest computed tomography (CT) findings revealed ""crazy-paving"" pattern in the right upper lobe implicating DAH and consolidation in the lower lobe. Analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid revealed DAH, with further analyses identifying L. pneumophila SG 1 as the causative agent. The patient was successfully treated with levofloxacin and a red blood cell transfusion and discharged on the 32nd day of hospitalization. A literature review of 6 reported cases (including our case) of Legionella pneumonia-associated DAH revealed that the median age of patients with DAH was 59 years (range, 44-75 years), involving female patients in 4 cases (67%) and the use of immunosuppressive drugs in 2 cases (33%). Three cases were BAL Legionella polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive and 4 cases were diagnosed using a urinary Legionella antigen test (one case was simultaneously PCR-positive). These infections were caused by L. pneumophila SG 1 in three cases and SG 3 in one case. Mechanical ventilation was used in 5 cases (83%) and one patient had an unfavorable prognosis. Steroids for DAH were used in 5 cases (83%), and 2 cases responded to this treatment. CONCLUSIONS Our case highlights that clinicians should be aware of Legionella spp. as a cause of DAH in an immunocompetent host with ""crazy-paving"" pattern on chest CT, and perform a urinary antigen test and BAL PCR for diagnosis.","['Ishikawa K', 'Nakamura T', 'Matsuo T', 'Kawai F', 'Murakami H', 'Aoki K', 'Nagasawa T', 'Uehara Y', 'Mori N']",2022,23,,Am J Case Rep,"Ishikawa K, et al.

35817249,Usefulness of the Legionella Score for differentiating from COVID-19 pneumonia to legionella pneumonia.,"Legionella pneumophila is a major causative pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but recently the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became the most common causative pathogen of CAP. Because L. pneumophila CAP is clinically distinct from bacterial CAPs, the Japan Society for Chemotherapy (JSC) developed a simple scoring system, the Legionella Score, using six parameters for the presumptive diagnosis of L. pneumophila pneumonia. We investigated the clinical and laboratory differences of L. pneumophila CAP and COVID-19 CAP and validated the Legionella Score in both CAP groups. We analyzed 102 patients with L. pneumophila CAP and 956 patients with COVID-19 CAP. Dyspnea and psychiatric symptoms were more frequently observed and cough was less frequently observed in patients with L. pneumophila CAP than those with COVID-19 CAP. Loss of taste and anosmia were observed in patients with COVID-19 CAP but not observed in those with L. pneumophila CAP. C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels in L. pneumophila CAP group were significantly higher than in the COVID-19 CAP group. In contrast, sodium level in the L. pneumophila CAP group was significantly lower than in the COVID-19 CAP group. The median Legionella Score was significantly higher in the L. pneumophila CAP group than the COVID-19 CAP group (score 4 vs 2, p < 0.001). Our results demonstrated that the JSC Legionella Score had good diagnostic ability during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, physicians should consider COVID-19 CAP when loss of taste and/or anosmia are observed regardless of the Legionella Score.","['Miyashita N', 'Higa F', 'Aoki Y', 'Kikuchi T', 'Seki M', 'Tateda K', 'Maki N', 'Uchino K', 'Kiyota H', 'Watanabe A']",2022,28,10,J Infect Chemother,"Miyashita N, et al.

35805725,Legionella and Air Transport: A Study of Environmental Contamination.,"Introduction: There is growing interest in the public health and transport sectors in research into exposure to biological hazards, considering not only the risks arising from inter-human contagion, but also those related to exposure to the flight environment itself. The aim of this paper is to report data from an investigation into the water and air-conditioning systems of commercial aircraft for the presence of Legionella contamination, with a total of 645 water samples taken during the period 2007−2021. Methods: The investigation involved 126 aircraft of six different commercial aircraft types: MD80, Airbus A320 F, Embraer 175/190, AIRBUS A330, Boeing 767 and Boeing 777. Water samples were taken from the water systems (toilet taps, galley and boilers). Each sample was preliminarily subjected to an evaluation of the following parameters: temperature, pH and residual chlorine. The ScanVit® Legionella kit was used for bacteria detection and enumeration. Results: Samples were considered positive if the number of colony-forming units/liter (CFU/L) was >100. For the entire observation period, 45% of the investigated aircraft tested positive. Regarding the overall number of samples analyzed, 68.4% (441/645) were below 100 CFU/L, and thus within the limits allowed by the Italian Guidelines. Conclusions: Water system contamination with Legionella in the air transport field is a real public health issue that should not be underestimated given the heavy passenger traffic. Infection should be considered an occupational risk to which crew members are exposed.","['Treglia M', 'Pallocci M', 'Ricciardi Tenore G', 'Castellani P', 'Pizzuti F', 'Bianco G', 'Passalacqua P', 'De Luca L', 'Zanovello C', 'Mazzuca D', 'Gratteri S', 'Messineo A', 'Quintavalle G', 'Marsella LT']",2022,19,13,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Treglia M, et al.

35799218,Phylogenies of the 16S rRNA gene and its hypervariable regions lack concordance with core genome phylogenies.,"BACKGROUND: The 16S rRNA gene is used extensively in bacterial phylogenetics, in species delineation, and now widely in microbiome studies. However, the gene suffers from intragenomic heterogeneity, and reports of recombination and an unreliable phylogenetic signal are accumulating. Here, we compare core gene phylogenies to phylogenies constructed using core gene concatenations to estimate the strength of signal for the 16S rRNA gene, its hypervariable regions, and all core genes at the intra- and inter-genus levels. Specifically, we perform four intra-genus analyses (Clostridium, n = 65; Legionella, n = 47; Staphylococcus, n = 36; and Campylobacter, n = 17) and one inter-genus analysis [41 core genera of the human gut microbiome (31 families, 17 orders, and 12 classes), n = 82].
RESULTS: At both taxonomic levels, the 16S rRNA gene was recombinant and subject to horizontal gene transfer. At the intra-genus level, the gene showed one of the lowest levels of concordance with the core genome phylogeny (50.7% average). Concordance for hypervariable regions was lower still, with entropy masking providing little to no benefit. A major factor influencing concordance was SNP count, which showed a positive logarithmic association. Using this relationship, we determined that 690 ± 110 SNPs were required for 80% concordance (average 16S rRNA gene SNP count was 254). We also found a wide range in 16S-23S-5S rRNA operon copy number among genomes (1-27). At the inter-genus level, concordance for the whole 16S rRNA gene was markedly higher (73.8% - 10th out of 49 loci); however, the most concordant hypervariable regions (V4, V3-V4, and V1-V2) ranked in the third quartile (62.5 to 60.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Ramifications of a poor phylogenetic performance for the 16S rRNA gene are far reaching. For example, in addition to incorrect species/strain delineation and phylogenetic inference, it has the potential to confound community diversity metrics if phylogenetic information is incorporated - for example, with popular approaches such as Faith's phylogenetic diversity and UniFrac. Our results highlight the problematic nature of these approaches and their use (along with entropy masking) is discouraged. Lastly, the wide range in 16S rRNA gene copy number among genomes also has a strong potential to confound diversity metrics.

As suggested by some studies, we wanted to verify whether the presence of P. aeruginosa can lead to a less frequent presence of Legionella in water systems of retirement homes and group homes. We collected 123 hot water and biofilm samples from showerheads. Samples were tested by selective culture methods, and Heterotrophic Plate Counts were determined. Legionella and P. aeruginosa were found in 35% and 39% of distal points, respectively. The presence of P. aeruginosa was significantly inversely correlated with the presence of Legionella when considering both matrices together (p&lt;0.01), water samples only (p=0.02), and biofilm samples only (p=0.04). The inverse relationship was strong for L. pneumophila sg1 (Odds Ratio 0.182, p=0.002), while it is no longer verified when only L. pneumophila serogroups 2-14 are considered.

Many Dot/Icm effectors are involved in biogenesis of the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), which allows intracellular bacterial replication in environmental amoebae and alveolar macrophages. Through their activity, some effectors trigger the mammalian host immune response in a phenomenon termed effector-triggered immunity (ETI).

The species includes 16 serogroups, but most Legionnaire's disease cases (85.7% in Europe, 87.0% in Japan) are caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) can be used to identify the L. pneumophila serogroup. In this study, we compared three sample preparation methods that are compatible with MALDI-TOF MS: the direct colony transfer method (DCTM), on-target extraction method (OTEM), and in-tube extraction method (ITEM). The aim was to improve the low identification rates for L. pneumophila, and establish and validate a simple, rapid and robust MALDI-TOF MS-based method for routine use in microbiological laboratories for assignment of L. pneumophila isolates to serogroups and identification of reliable peak biomarkers. Using ITEM, 100.0% (29/29) of hot spring water samples and clinical isolates were correctly identified at the species level. Augmented reference spectra correctly identified all 29 strains at the species level and 29 isolates at the serogroup level, displaying sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 100.0% for serogroup assignment. MALDI-TOF MS is a relatively inexpensive method for assignment of L. pneumophila serogroups that can serve as a first-line tool for rapid prospective typing.","['Sogawa K', 'Ishizaki N', 'Ishige T', 'Murata S', 'Taniguchi T', 'Furuhata K']",2022,27,2,Biocontrol Sci,"Sogawa K, et al.

35738203,Aberrant hepatic lipid metabolism associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis triggers hepatotoxicity of novel PFOS alternatives in adult zebrafish.,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been reported to induce hepatotoxicity in wildlife and humans. Novel PFOS alternatives have been widely used following restrictions on PFOS, but little is known about their potential toxicity. Here, the first comprehensive investigation on the chronic hepatotoxicity and underlying molecular mechanisms of PFOS, 6:2Cl-PFESA (F-53B), and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS) was carried out on adult zebrafish through a histopathological examination, biochemical measurement, and multi-omics analysis. PFOS and its alternatives caused changes in liver histopathology and liver function indices in the order of F-53B > PFOS > OBS, which was consistent with their concentration in the liver. In silico modeling and transcriptional profiles suggested that the aberrant hepatic lipid metabolism induced by F-53B and PFOS was initiated by the action on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which triggered changes in downstream genes transcription and led to an imbalance between lipid synthesis and expenditure. Gut microbiome analysis provided another novel mechanistic perspective that changes in the abundance of Legionella, Ralstonia, Brevundimonas, Alphaproteobacteria, Plesiomonas, and Hyphomicrobium might link to alterations in the PPAR pathway based on their significant correlation. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of hepatotoxicity induced by PFOS and its novel alternatives and highlights the need for concern about their environmental exposure risks.","['Wang Q', 'Huang J', 'Liu S', 'Wang C', 'Jin Y', 'Lai H', 'Tu W']",2022,166,,Environ Int,"Wang Q, et al.

In addition to the immediate destruction caused by storm surges and catastrophic flooding, these events may also increase the risk of infectious disease transmission. We aimed to determine the association between extreme and seasonal floods and hospitalizations for Legionnaires' disease in 25 US states during 2000-2011.
METHODS: We used a nonparametric bootstrap approach to examine the association between Legionnaires' disease hospitalizations and extreme floods, defined by multiple hydrometeorological variables. We also assessed the effect of extreme flooding associated with named cyclonic storms on hospitalizations in a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) framework. To quantify the effect of seasonal floods, we used multi-model inference to identify the most highly weighted flood-indicator variables and evaluated their effects on hospitalizations in a GLMM.
RESULTS: We found a 32% increase in monthly hospitalizations at sites that experienced cyclonic storms, compared to sites in months without storms. Hospitalizations in months with extreme precipitation were in the 89
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is the first to examine the effects of flooding on hospitalizations for Legionnaires' disease in the United States using a range of flood-indicator variables and flood definitions. We found evidence that extreme and seasonal flooding is associated with increased hospitalizations; further research is required to mechanistically establish whether floodwaters contaminated with Legionella bacteria drive transmission.","['Lynch VD', 'Shaman J']",2022,22,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Lynch VD and Shaman J.

35701729,Megaviruses contain various genes encoding for eukaryotic vesicle trafficking factors.,"Many intracellular pathogens, such as bacteria and large viruses, enter eukaryotic cells via phagocytosis, then replicate and proliferate inside the host. To avoid degradation in the phagosomes, they have developed strategies to modify vesicle trafficking. Although several strategies of bacteria have been characterized, it is not clear whether viruses also interfere with the vesicle trafficking of the host. Recently, we came across SNARE proteins encoded in the genomes of several bacteria of the order Legionellales. These pathogenic bacteria may use SNAREs to interfere with vesicle trafficking, since SNARE proteins are the core machinery for vesicle fusion during transport. They assemble into membrane-bridging SNARE complexes that bring membranes together. We now have also discovered SNARE proteins in the genomes of diverse giant viruses. Our biochemical experiments showed that these proteins are able to form SNARE complexes. We also found other key trafficking factors that work together with SNAREs such as NSF, SM, and Rab proteins encoded in the genomes of giant viruses, suggesting that viruses can make use of a large genetic repertoire of trafficking factors. Most giant viruses possess different collections, suggesting that these factors entered the viral genome multiple times. In the future, the molecular role of these factors during viral infection need to be studied.","['Khalifeh D', 'Neveu E', 'Fasshauer D']",2022,23,8,Traffic,"Khalifeh D, et al.

In this review, we assess how some of these interactions could be used to develop a biological-driven ""probiotic"" control approach against Legionella. We focus on: (i) mechanisms limiting the ability of Legionella to establish and replicate within some of their natural protozoan hosts; (ii) exploitative and interference competitive interactions between Legionella and other microorganisms; and (iii) the potential of predatory bacteria and phages against Legionella.

35655418,"The Triad of Legionnaires' Disease, Rhabdomyolysis, and Acute Kidney Injury: A Case Report.","BACKGROUND Legionella infection is a common cause of atypical pneumonia, known as Legionnaires' disease when infection extends to extrapulmonary involvement, which often leads to hospitalization. The triad of Legionella pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure displays a rare yet fatal complication without prompt management. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 62-year-old man with no significant medical history who developed Legionnaires' disease with severely elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) of 9614 mcg/L, consistent with rhabdomyolysis. He experienced severe headache, anorexia, and hematuria, which prompted him to seek medical care. Pertinent social history included recent flooding in his neighborhood, which surrounded the outer perimeter of his home. His clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were consistent with Legionella infection, with concomitant acute kidney injury. A chest X-ray revealed hazy left perihilar opacities concerning for atypical pneumonia. Immediate interventions of hydration and antigen-directed azithromycin were initiated to prevent rapid decompensation. His clinical symptoms resolved without further complications, and he was not transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). CONCLUSIONS Legionella-induced rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon association that can lead to acute kidney failure and rapid clinical deterioration. Early and aggressive management with fluid repletion and appropriate antibiotics can improve clinical manifestations and hospital length of stay. Our patient's reduction in CPK levels and clinical improvement confirmed that extrapulmonary involvement in Legionella infection can lead to rhabdomyolysis. It is important for healthcare providers to recognize the clinical triad of Legionella pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure as prompt and timely management to reduce associated morbidity.","['Kao AS', 'Herath CJ', 'Ismail R', 'Hettiarachchi ME']",2022,23,,Am J Case Rep,"Kao AS, et al.

35653564,Reversible modification of mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocases by paired Legionella effector proteins.,"Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation is a reversible posttranslational modification involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes. Prototype ADP ribosyltransferases (ARTs) from many pathogenic bacteria are known to function as toxins, while other bacterial ARTs have just recently emerged. Recent studies have shown that bacteria also possess enzymes that function as poly-ADP ribose (ADPr) glycohydrolases (PARGs), which reverse poly-ADP ribosylation. However, how bacteria manipulate host target proteins by coordinated reactions of ARTs and ADPr hydrolases (ARHs) remains elusive. The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease, transports a large array of effector proteins via the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system to host cells. The effector proteins, which mostly function as enzymes, modulate host cellular processes for the bacteria’s benefit. In this study, we identified a pair of L. pneumophila effector proteins, Lpg0080 and Lpg0081, which function as an ART and an ARH, respectively. The two proteins were shown to coordinately modulate mitochondrial ADP/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) translocases (ANTs) by their enzymatic activities to conjugate ADPr to, and remove it from, a key arginine residue. The crystal structures of Lpg0081 and the Lpg0081:ADPr complex indicated that Lpg0081 is a macroD-type ARH with a noncanonical macrodomain, whose folding topology is strikingly distinct from that of the canonical macrodomain that is ubiquitously found in eukaryotic PARGs and ARHs. Our results illustrate that L. pneumophila has acquired an effector pair that coordinately manipulate mitochondrial activity via reversible chemical modification of ANTs.","['Kubori T', 'Lee J', 'Kim H', 'Yamazaki K', 'Nishikawa M', 'Kitao T', 'Oh BH', 'Nagai H']",2022,119,23,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Kubori T, et al.

The primary role of ubiquitin is maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. Ubiquitination regulates the fate of target proteins using the proteasome- or autophagymediated degradation of ubiquitinated substrates, which can be either intracellular or foreign proteins from invading pathogens. Legionella, a gram-negative intracellular pathogen, hinders the host-ubiquitin system by translocating hundreds of effector proteins into the host cell's cytoplasm. In this review, we describe the current understanding of ubiquitin machinery from Legionella. We summarize structural and biochemical differences between the host-ubiquitin system and ubiquitin-related effectors of Legionella. Some of these effectors act much like canonical host-ubiquitin machinery, whereas others have distinctive structures and accomplish non-canonical ubiquitination via novel biochemical mechanisms.

35643782,Cerebellar syndrome associated with legionellosis: A case report and literature review.,"INTRODUCTION: Legionnaire's disease is a community-acquired pneumonia caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila. This disease is often associated with neurological symptoms, the clinical presentation of which can be very varied.
CASE REPORT: We report a 47-year-old female patient who developed Legionnaires' disease with cerebellar symptoms (ataxia, dysarthria and hypermetria). Laboratory tests revealed a biological inflammatory syndrome. The cerebrospinal fluid was sterile. Urinary antigen test and serology were positive for L. pneumophila. An interstitial syndrome of the right upper lobe was detected on chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and CT angiography) showed no abnormalities. The outcome was favourable after treatment with spiramycin, levofloxacin and corticosteroids.
DISCUSSION: Few cases only (n=110) of Legionnaires' disease with cerebellar symptoms have been reported in the literature. The pathogenic mechanism behind neurological dysfunction in patients with Legionnaires' disease is unknown. Neurological symptoms improve with antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids. Extra-pulmonary forms of Legionnaires' disease are frequent, with neurological symptoms being the most common symptoms. Cerebellar dysfunction may be underestimated and requires appropriate management with antibiotic therapy and corticosteroid therapy. Recommendations for the management of Legionnaire's disease with severe extra-pulmonary symptoms are needed.","['Diallo K', 'Rivière M', 'Gutierrez B', 'Andry F', 'Bertolotti A', 'Zemali N', 'Saint-Pastou Terrier C', 'Manaquin R', 'Koumar Y', 'Poubeau P']",2022,43,7,Rev Med Interne,"Diallo K, et al.

35633636,Legionnaires' disease - a qualitative study on Swiss physicians' approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: The number of reported cases of Legionnaires' disease has increased significantly over the last decade in Switzerland and abroad. Along with the number of cases, the volume of testing has increased as well, which has been partially attributed to a change in awareness of the disease. Yet, while there are numerous guidelines and recommendations for the case management of community-acquired pneumonia, little is known about how physicians in Switzerland perceive and manage Legionnaires' disease.
METHODS: This study aimed to investigate physicians' awareness of Legionnaires' disease, their information resources and their approach to the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia (and thus Legionnaires' disease). Using a semi-structured interview guide, we conducted in-depth interviews with physicians from different levels of care and from the German-, French- and Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland.
RESULTS: We conducted 46 interviews with physicians from university, cantonal and regional hospitals as well as with general practitioners (GPs) from all three language regions. Overall, the physicians working in hospitals indicated a similar level of awareness of Legionnaires' disease, and comparable diagnosis and treatment approaches. The Legionella urine antigen test (UAT) was reported to be routinely performed in inpatients. In contrast, GPs indicated lower levels of awareness, reflecting the fact that they treat pneumonia cases empirically without identification of the causative agent, in accordance with current guidelines. The value of the diagnostic tests in general and the Legionella UAT in particular was considered to be dependent on the (preferred) antibiotic treatment approach. Some physicians saw the test as redundant, as its result would not influence treatment. This was tied to concerns about the UAT's sensitivity and its limited use for the detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Lastly, extrinsic constraints, such as financial and time considerations also affected physicians' testing and treatment preferences.
CONCLUSION: Awareness of Legionnaires' disease is overall high, yet cases are mainly diagnosed and reported by hospitals. Improved diagnostic tools are needed to support physicians in reducing underestimation of Legionnaires' disease and optimise antibiotic stewardship without compromising patient health outcomes.","['Fischer FB', 'Deml MJ', 'Mäusezahl D']",2022,152,17-18,Swiss Med Wkly,"Fischer FB, et al.

35617788,Design and operational considerations in response to Legionella occurrence in Las Vegas Valley groundwater.,"Legionella occurrence monitoring is not required by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) drinking water regulations, and few occurrence studies exist for Legionella in source water or distribution systems. Legionella occurrence was monitored in Las Vegas Valley (Las Vegas, Nevada, USA) drinking water sources, including non-treated surface water, seasonal groundwater (61 wells, before and after chlorination), finished water (after treatment at water treatment facilities), and chlorinated distribution system water (at 9 reservoirs and 75 sample locations throughout the network). Legionella pneumophila was detected at least once at each of the wells sampled before chlorination, with an overall positivity rate of 38% (343/908). During well start-up (time<2 hours; turbidity>3 NTU), L. pneumophila concentrations averaged 2,792±353 MPN/100 mL, with a median of 105 MPN/100 mL, and range of <1 to 90,490 MPN/100 mL across 61 seasonally operated (typically April-October) groundwater wells. After initial flushing (turbidity<3 NTU), the average concentration decreased by more than two orders of magnitude to 24±3 MPN/100 mL but ranged from <1 to >2,273 MPN/100 mL.

35610634,Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and Legionella pneumonia: a case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a rare clinicopathological condition. Studies in the literature have reported that AFOP may be associated with respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Penicillium citrinum, and Chlamydia infections. However, AFOP associated with Legionella infection has not been reported previously. Here, we report a case of a patient with AFOP secondary to Sjögren's syndrome and Legionella infection.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of fever, expectoration, and shortness of breath. Lung imaging showed irregular patchy consolidation. A diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia was initially considered on the basis of the patient's history of exposure to soil before disease onset, signs of extrapulmonary involvement, and a positive Legionella urine antigen test result. However, the patient's symptoms and lung imaging did not improve after treatment with levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and tigecycline for Legionella infection. In addition, Sjögren's syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of clinical manifestations and immunological indicators. Pathological changes associated with AFOP were confirmed from the results of ultrasound-guided percutaneous lung biopsy. The patient's clinical symptoms improved rapidly after a short course of low-dose corticosteroid therapy, and lung imaging showed significant improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of secondary AFOP should be considered when Legionella pneumonia does not improve after standard antibiotic therapy. Lung biopsy and histopathological examination are important for the adjustment of treatment strategy. Our case also highlights the importance of screening for autoimmune diseases in patients with AFOP.","['Lu Y', 'Zheng W', 'Cao W', 'Yang X', 'Zhao L', 'Chen Y']",2022,22,1,BMC Pulm Med,"Lu Y, et al.

METHODS: Through the experiment of the co-culture of RAW264.7 macrophages with different concentrations of MIP, the chemotactic activity of macrophages was detected and the phagocytosis was determined by a neutral red uptake assay. The expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) GAS5, microRNA-21 (miR-21), and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)6 was determined by qRT-PCR. Target genes were detected by dual luciferase assay.
RESULTS: MIP could reduce the phagocytosis and improve the chemotaxis of RAW264.7 macrophages. The expression of both lncRNA GAS5 and SOCS6 was increased whereas the expression of miR-21 was decreased when macrophages were treated with MIP. Dual luciferase assay revealed that lncRNA GAS5 could interact with miR-21, and SOCS6 served as the target of miR-21. After GAS5 overexpression, the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 treated with MIP was increased whereas the chemotaxis was decreased. In contrast, the opposite results were found in RAW264.7 following GAS5 interference.

35534798,Validating a clinical prediction score for Legionella-related community acquired pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella-related community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a disease with an increasing incidence and a high mortality rate, especially if empirical antibiotic therapy is inadequate. Antibiotic treatment highly relies on clinical symptoms, although proven non-specific, because currently available diagnostic techniques provide insufficient accuracy for detecting Legionella CAP on admission. This study validates a diagnostic scoring system for detection of Legionella-related CAP, based on six items on admission (Legionella prediction score).
METHODS: We included patients with Legionella-related CAP admitted to five large Dutch hospitals between 2006 and 2016. Controls were non-Legionella-related CAP patients. The following six conditions were rewarded one point if present: fever > 39.4 °C; dry cough; hyponatremia (sodium) < 133 mmol/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 225 mmol/L; C-reactive protein (CRP) > 187 mg/L and platelet count < 171 × 10
RESULTS: We included 131 cases and 160 controls. A score of 0 occurred in non-Legionella-related CAP patients only, a score of 5 and 6 in Legionella-related CAP patients only. A cut-off ≥ 4 resulted in a sensitivity of 58.8% and a specificity of 93.1%. The AUC was 0.89 (95% CI 0.86-0.93). The strongest predictors were elevated LDH, elevated CRP and hyponatremia.
CONCLUSIONS: This multi-centre study validates the Legionella prediction score, an easily applicable diagnostic scoring system, in a large group of patients and finds high diagnostic accuracy. The score shows promise for future prospective validation and could contribute to targeted antibiotic treatment of suspected Legionella CAP.","['Beekman RRAL', 'Duijkers RR', 'Snijders DD', 'van der Eerden MM', 'Kross MM', 'Boersma WWG']",2022,22,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Beekman RRAL, et al.

35505308,Accuracy of a score predicting the presence of an atypical pathogen in hospitalized patients with moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: Atypical pathogens (AP), present in some patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), are intrinsically resistant to betalactam drugs, the mainstay of empirical antibiotic treatment. Adding antibiotic coverage for AP increases the risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial selection pressure, while withholding such coverage may worsen the prognosis if an AP is causative. A clinical model predicting the presence of AP would allow targeting atypical coverage for patients most likely to benefit.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a multicentric randomized controlled trial that included 580 adults patients hospitalized for CAP. A predictive score was built using independent predictive factors for AP identified through multivariate analysis. Accuracy of the score was assessed using area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity.
RESULTS: Prevalence of AP was 5.3%. Age < 75 years (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.2), heart failure (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.1), absence of chest pain (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1-8.2), natremia < 135 mmol/L (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-6.6) and contracting the disease in autumn (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.9) were independently associated with AP. A predictive score using these factors had an AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.85). A score of 0 or 1 (present in 33% of patients) had 100% sensitivity and 35% specificity.
CONCLUSION: Use of a score built on easily obtained clinical and laboratory data would allow safe withholding of atypical antibiotic coverage in a significant number of patients, with an expected positive impact on bacterial resistance and drug adverse effects.

METHODS: Sixty-nine immunocompromised patients with suspected pneumonia received both CMTs and mNGS of BALF were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnostic value was compared between CMTs and mNGS, using the clinical composite diagnosis as the reference standard.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were diagnosed of pneumonia including fifty-two patients with identified pathogens and eight patients with probable pathogens. Taking the composite reference standard as a gold standard, 42 pathogens were identified by CMTs including nine bacteria, 17 fungi, 8 virus, 6 Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, and two Legionella and 19(45%) of which were detected by BALF culture. As for mNGS, it identified 76 pathogens including 20 bacteria, 31 fungi, 14 virus, 5 Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, four Legionella and two Chlamydia psittaci. The overall detection rate of mNGS for pathogens were higher than that of CMTs. However, a comparable diagnostic accuracy of mNGS and CMTs were found for bacterial and viral infections. mNGS exhibited a higher diagnostic accuracy for fungal detection than CMTs (78% vs. 57%, P < 0.05), which mainly because of the high sensitivity of mNGS in patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) (100% vs. 28%, P < 0.05). Nineteen patients were identified as pulmonary co-infection, mNGS test showed a higher detection rate and broader spectrum for pathogen detection than that of CMTs in co-infection. Moreover, Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common pathogen in co-infection and mNGS have identified much more co-pathogens of PJP than CMTs.
CONCLUSIONS: mNGS of BALF improved the microbial detection rate of pathogens and exhibited remarkable advantages in detecting PJP and identifying co-infection in immunocompromised patients.","['Lin P', 'Chen Y', 'Su S', 'Nan W', 'Zhou L', 'Zhou Y', 'Li Y']",2022,22,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Lin P, et al.

35429876,Inactivation of biofilm-bound bacterial cells using irradiation across UVC wavelengths.,"Opportunistic pathogens (OPs), such as Pseudomonas spp., Legionella spp., and mycobacteria, have been detected in biofilms in drinking water distribution systems and water storage tanks and pose potential risks to finished drinking water quality and safety. Emerging UV technologies, such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs) and krypton chloride (KrCl*) excimers, could provide an alternative to chemical-based secondary disinfection (i.e., chlorine or chloramines) for controlling biofilm-bound OPs. UV systems offer long lifetimes, ability to select wavelength, small size with high power density, and limited-to-no disinfection by-product formation. In this study, inactivation of biofilm-bound Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells across different maturities was investigated using five UVC devices with different peak emission wavelengths, including a KrCl* excimer (222 nm), a low pressure mercury vapor lamp (254 nm), and three UV LEDs (260 nm, 270 nm, and 282 nm). The UV transmittance and absorbance through the biofilm structure was also documented for the first time using a unique approach. Our results show all UVC devices can inactivate biofilm-bound P. aeruginosa cells up to a point, among which the UV LED with peak emission at 270 nm provided the best disinfection performance. UV sensitivities of biofilm-bound cells decreased with biofilm maturity and while initial rates of inactivation were high, no more than 1.5-2.5 log reduction was possible. Re-suspended biofilm bacteria in aqueous solution were highly sensitive to UV, reaching greater than 6 log reduction. UV shielding by biofilm constituents was observed and was likely one of the reasons for UV resistance but did not fully explain the difference in UV sensitivity between biofilm-bound cells versus planktonic cells. This study improves upon fundamental knowledge and provides guidance for innovative designs using emerging UV technologies for biofilm and pathogen control in water distribution systems.","['Ma B', 'Seyedi S', 'Wells E', 'McCarthy D', 'Crosbie N', 'Linden KG']",2022,217,,Water Res,"Ma B, et al.

35427813,New Global Insights on the Regulation of the Biphasic Life Cycle and Virulence Via ClpP-Dependent Proteolysis in Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila, an environmental bacterium that parasitizes protozoa, causes Legionnaires' disease in humans that is characterized by severe pneumonia. This bacterium adopts a distinct biphasic life cycle consisting of a nonvirulent replicative phase and a virulent transmissive phase in response to different environmental conditions. Hence, the timely and fine-tuned expression of growth and virulence factors in a life cycle-dependent manner is crucial for survival and replication. Here, we report that the completion of the biphasic life cycle and bacterial pathogenesis is greatly dependent on the protein homeostasis regulated by caseinolytic protease P (ClpP)-dependent proteolysis. We characterized the ClpP-dependent dynamic profiles of the regulatory and substrate proteins during the biphasic life cycle of L. pneumophila using proteomic approaches and discovered that ClpP-dependent proteolysis specifically and conditionally degraded the substrate proteins, thereby directly playing a regulatory role or indirectly controlling cellular events via the regulatory proteins. We further observed that ClpP-dependent proteolysis is required to monitor the abundance of fatty acid biosynthesis-related protein Lpg0102/Lpg0361/Lpg0362 and SpoT for the normal regulation of L. pneumophila differentiation. We also found that the control of the biphasic life cycle and bacterial virulence is independent. Furthermore, the ClpP-dependent proteolysis of Dot/Icm (defect in organelle trafficking/intracellular multiplication) type IVB secretion system and effector proteins at a specific phase of the life cycle is essential for bacterial pathogenesis. Therefore, our findings provide novel insights on ClpP-dependent proteolysis, which spans a broad physiological spectrum involving key metabolic pathways that regulate the transition of the biphasic life cycle and bacterial virulence of L. pneumophila, facilitating adaptation to aquatic and intracellular niches.","['Ge Z', 'Yuan P', 'Chen L', 'Chen J', 'Shen D', 'She Z', 'Lu Y']",2022,21,5,Mol Cell Proteomics,"Ge Z, et al.

Here we show by comparative proteomics that in biofilms formed by the L. pneumophila ΔlqsR or ΔlvbR regulatory mutants the abundance of proteins encoded by a genomic 'fitness island', metabolic enzymes, effector proteins and flagellar components (e.g. FlaA) varies. ∆lqsR or ∆flaA mutants form 'patchy' biofilms like the parental strain JR32, while ∆lvbR forms a 'mat-like' biofilm. Acanthamoeba castellanii amoebae migrated more slowly through biofilms of L. pneumophila lacking lqsR, lvbR, flaA, a functional Icm/Dot T4SS (∆icmT), or secreted effector proteins.

35388097,Extensive epigenetic modification with large-scale chromosomal and plasmid recombination characterise the Legionella longbeachae serogroup 1 genome.,"Legionella longbeachae is an environmental bacterium that is the most clinically significant Legionella species in New Zealand (NZ), causing around two-thirds of all notified cases of Legionnaires' disease. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the geo-temporal genetic diversity of 54 L. longbeachae serogroup 1 (sg1) clinical isolates, derived from cases from around NZ over a 22-year period, including one complete genome and its associated methylome. The 54 sg1 isolates belonged to two main clades that last shared a common ancestor between 95 BCE and 1694 CE. There was diversity at the genome-structural level, with large-scale arrangements occurring in some regions of the chromosome and evidence of extensive chromosomal and plasmid recombination. This includes the presence of plasmids derived from recombination and horizontal gene transfer between various Legionella species, indicating there has been both intra- and inter-species gene flow. However, because similar plasmids were found among isolates within each clade, plasmid recombination events may pre-empt the emergence of new L. longbeachae strains.

35370255,Significance of Hypophosphatemia in Patients with Pneumonia.,"Objective Phosphate is a fundamental element involved in a number of physiological pathways. A previous study showed abnormal laboratory findings and a higher mortality in hypophosphatemic patients than in normophosphatemic patients with pneumonia. Sporadic cases of pneumonia due to Legionella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viruses have been reported; however, the significance of hypophosphatemia in patients with pneumonia has not been adequately studied. We determined whether or not hypophosphatemia in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was associated with specific pathogens, patient factors, disease severity, and mortality. Method We retrospectively analyzed 600 patients with CAP who were admitted to our hospital between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. Results Hypophosphatemia was found in 72 (12.0%) of the 600 patients. The most frequent causative microbial agents of CAP in patients with hypophosphatemia were S. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., and influenza virus, whereas in severely ill patients with hypophosphatemia, influenza virus was the most common. Legionella spp., diabetes mellitus, and severe pneumonia were the independent factors for hypophosphatemia in the multivariable analysis. An impaired performance status, severe status on admission, interstitial pneumonia, bacteremia, and guideline-discordant therapy were the independent factors associated with mortality in the multivariable analysis. Hypophosphatemia was not significantly associated with mortality but showed a trend towards higher mortality in the multivariable analysis. Conclusion Hypophosphatemia was not associated with the prognosis in patients with CAP. However, the significance of hypophosphatemia for clinicians lies in the laboratory findings that predict abnormal glucose metabolism, Legionella infection, and severe disease.","['Morimoto Y', 'Ishiguro T', 'Uozumi R', 'Takano K', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Shimizu Y', 'Takayanagi N']",2022,61,7,Intern Med,"Morimoto Y, et al.

Our study aimed to understand the association of gut and blood microbiomes in patients with IgAN in relation to healthy controls.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with 20 patients with progressive IgAN, matched with 20 healthy controls, and analyzed bacterial DNA quantitatively in blood using 16S PCR and qualitatively in blood and stool using 16S metagenomic sequencing. We conducted between-group comparisons as well as comparisons between the blood and gut microbiomes.
RESULTS: Higher median 16S bacterial DNA in blood was found in the IgAN group compared with the healthy controls group (7410 versus 6030 16S rDNA copies/
CONCLUSIONS: Important bacterial taxonomic differences, quantitatively in blood and qualitatively in both blood and stool samples, that were detected between IgAN and healthy groups warrant further investigation into their roles in the pathogenesis of IgAN. Although gut bacterial translocation into blood may be one of the potential sources of the blood microbiome, marked taxonomic differences between gut and blood samples in each subject in both groups confirms that the blood microbiome does not directly reflect the gut microbiome. Further research is needed into other possible sites of origin and internal regulation of the blood microbiome.","['Shah NB', 'Nigwekar SU', 'Kalim S', 'Lelouvier B', 'Servant F', 'Dalal M', 'Krinsky S', 'Fasano A', 'Tolkoff-Rubin N', 'Allegretti AS']",2021,2,8,Kidney360,"Shah NB, et al.

35364354,Toxoflavin secreted by Pseudomonas alcaliphila inhibits the growth of Legionella pneumophila and Vermamoeba vermiformis.,"Legionella pneumophila is a natural inhabitant of water systems. From there, it can be transmitted to humans by aerosolization resulting in severe pneumonia. Most large outbreaks are caused by cooling towers colonized with L. pneumophila. The resident microbiota of the cooling tower is a key determinant for the colonization and growth of L. pneumophila. In our preceding study, the genus Pseudomonas correlated negatively with the presence of L. pneumophila in cooling towers, but it was not clear which species was responsible. Therefore, we identified the Pseudomonas species inhabiting 14 cooling towers using a Pseudomonas-specific 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing strategy. We found that cooling towers that are free of L. pneumophila contained a high relative abundance of members from the Pseudomonas alcaliphila/oleovorans phylogenetic cluster. P. alcaliphila JCM 10630 inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila on agar plates. Analysis of the P. alcaliphila genome revealed the presence of a gene cluster predicted to produce toxoflavin. L. pneumophila growth was inhibited by pure toxoflavin and by extracts from P. alcaliphila culture found to contain toxoflavin by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. In addition, toxoflavin inhibits the growth of Vermameoba vermiformis, a host cell of L. pneumophila. Our study indicates that P. alcaliphila may be important to restrict growth of L. pneumophila in water systems through the production of toxoflavin. A sufficiently high concentration of toxoflavin is likely not achieved in the bulk water but might have a local inhibitory effect such as near or in biofilms.","['Faucher SP', 'Matthews S', 'Nickzad A', 'Vounba P', 'Shetty D', 'Bédard É', 'Prévost M', 'Déziel E', 'Paranjape K']",2022,216,,Water Res,"Faucher SP, et al.

35294506,MurA escape mutations uncouple peptidoglycan biosynthesis from PrkA signaling.,"Gram-positive bacteria are protected by a thick mesh of peptidoglycan (PG) completely engulfing their cells. This PG network is the main component of the bacterial cell wall, it provides rigidity and acts as foundation for the attachment of other surface molecules. Biosynthesis of PG consumes a high amount of cellular resources and therefore requires careful adjustments to environmental conditions. An important switch in the control of PG biosynthesis of Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive pathogen with a high infection fatality rate, is the serine/threonine protein kinase PrkA. A key substrate of this kinase is the small cytosolic protein ReoM. We have shown previously that ReoM phosphorylation regulates PG formation through control of MurA stability. MurA catalyzes the first step in PG biosynthesis and the current model suggests that phosphorylated ReoM prevents MurA degradation by the ClpCP protease. In contrast, conditions leading to ReoM dephosphorylation stimulate MurA degradation. How ReoM controls degradation of MurA and potential other substrates is not understood. Also, the individual contribution of the ~20 other known PrkA targets to PG biosynthesis regulation is unknown. We here present murA mutants which escape proteolytic degradation. The release of MurA from ClpCP-dependent proteolysis was able to activate PG biosynthesis and further enhanced the intrinsic cephalosporin resistance of L. monocytogenes. This latter effect required the RodA3/PBP B3 transglycosylase/transpeptidase pair. One murA escape mutation not only fully rescued an otherwise non-viable prkA mutant during growth in batch culture and inside macrophages but also overcompensated cephalosporin hypersensitivity. Our data collectively indicate that the main purpose of PrkA-mediated signaling in L. monocytogenes is control of MurA stability during standard laboratory growth conditions and intracellular growth in macrophages. These findings have important implications for the understanding of PG biosynthesis regulation and β-lactam resistance of L. monocytogenes and related Gram-positive bacteria.","['Wamp S', 'Rothe P', 'Stern D', 'Holland G', 'Döhling J', 'Halbedel S']",2022,18,3,PLoS Pathog,"Wamp S, et al.

35278991,"Comprehensive assessment of bacterial communities and their functional profiles in the Huang Gang Creek in the Tatun Volcano Group basin, Taiwan using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.","The microbial characteristics of water bodies located in the outflow of hot springs may affect the water quality parameters of the associated river ecosystem. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we investigated the bacterial diversity and functional profiles of the Huang Gang (HG) Creek, located in the trace metal-rich, acid-sulfate thermal springs zone of the Tatun Volcano Group (TVG). Biofilms and water samples were collected from the upstream, midstream, and geothermal valleys and downstream of the creek. The results showed that the biofilm and water samples had distinct bacterial diversity and abundance profiles. Acidophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were found to be more abundant in water samples, whereas aquatic photosynthetic bacterial communities were dominant in biofilms. The water samples were contaminated with Legionella and Chlamydiae, which could contaminate the nearby river and cause clinical infections in humans. The upstream samples were highly unique and displayed higher diversity than the other sites. Moderate thermo-acidophiles were dominant in the upstream and midstream regions, whereas the geothermal valley and downstream samples were abundant in thermo-acidophiles. In addition, functional profiling revealed higher expression of sulfur, arsenic, and iron-related functions in water and lead-related functions in the biofilms of the creek. As described in previous studies, the hydrochemical properties of the HG Creek were influenced by the TVG hot springs. Our findings indicated that the hydrochemical properties of the HG Creek were highly correlated with the bacterial diversity and functional potential of running water as compared to biofilms.","['Chen JS', 'Tsai HC', 'Hsu YL', 'Nagarajan V', 'Su HY', 'Hussain B', 'Hsu BM']",2022,234,,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,"Chen JS, et al.

35278295,Concomitance of COVID-19 and legionnaires' disease - a case series.,"UNLABELLED: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and legionnaires disease (LD) caused by Gram-negative water-born bacteria Legionella pneumophila show certain similarities, including a predisposition to pulmonary involvement and extrapulmonary manifestations in some of the patients infected. One disease can mimic the other, both can rarely coexist.
CASE SERIES REPORT: The authors describe 7 such cases (5 females), aged 51-90 years (mean 69.7 years) detected while screening 133 subjects with moderate to severe pneumonia and confirmed COVID- 19, which constituted 5.3% of the patients in whom urinary antigen test (UAT) for L. pneumophila was performed. The patients had multiple concomitant disorders: hypertension (6), heart failure (4), diabetes (4), obesity (4), coronary heart disease (3), chronic kidney disease (3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3), anemia (3). Positive UAT was obtained at admission in 4 patients, and on 3rd, 11th and 14th days of hospitalization in the remaining 3 patients. One patient also had positive UAT for Streptococcus pneumoniae. We analyzed: radiological imaging, laboratory data (CRP, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, troponin I, BNP), ECG, echocardiography, treatment and outcome. Three patients required a modification of initial antibiotic therapy, two developed Clostridioides difficile infection. The duration of hospitalization ranged from 13 to 59 days (mean 24.3 days); two patients died.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that the coexistence of COVID- 19 and LD may result in prolonged hospitalization, in increased mortality risk and in subsequent cardiovascular complications, including takotsubo syndrome (TTS) which was found in 2 cases, both presented as focal TTS (fTTS).","['Elikowski W', 'Fertała N', 'Zawodna-Marszałek M', 'Chwiałkowska M', 'Połeć J', 'Lisiecka M', 'Skrzywanek P', 'Rajewska-Tabor J', 'Zwoliński P', 'Drużdż A', 'Pyda M', 'Żytkiewicz M']",2022,50,295,Pol Merkur Lekarski,"Elikowski W, et al.

35273879,Herpes Simplex Virus Pneumonia Mimicking Legionella Pneumonia in an Elderly Patient With Heart and Liver Failure.,"The diagnosis of viral pneumonia is often difficult because of its varied presentations. Regarding the serological diagnosis of viral infections, it is difficult to perform a viral DNA test in general medical facilities, especially in rural settings. Among viral pneumonia cases, herpes simplex virus (HSV) pneumonia can occur in immunocompromised hosts. However, when the clinical course of HSV pneumonia is acute, and the features of pneumonia are not distinct, the diagnosis can be challenging. We report the case of a 69-year-old man who visited the hospital with complaints of dyspnea and cough for two days. Although the patient had no fever and the urine was negative for Legionella antigen, we suspected Legionella pneumonia based on the clinical course, Gram stain of sputum, and CT findings. After undergoing treatment with antibiotics, his condition worsened, with dyspnea and an increase in the demand for oxygen at 5 L. The patient also had complications related to the heart and liver. The sputum culture was negative, and the HSV serum test revealed that HSV IgM level was elevated to 1.16 (reference value: ≤0.80) and IgG level at admission and at follow-up 21 days later was elevated to 28.1 and 60.0 respectively (reference value: ≤2.0); accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with HSV pneumonia. In cases of pneumonia with atypical courses, the coexistence of multiple diseases, and immunosuppression, HSV pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis. In rural settings, viral pneumonia should be investigated using antibodies against viruses due to the limited availability of other medical resources. When a patient is judged to be immunosuppressed in the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause, it is important to consider the possibility of HSV infection and take prompt action. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the possibility of multi-organ failure secondary to HSV infection, which requires systemic management.","['Yamashita M', 'Ohta R', 'Mouri N', 'Takizawa S', 'Sano C']",2022,14,2,Cureus,"Yamashita M, et al.

35246533,The molecular basis of FimT-mediated DNA uptake during bacterial natural transformation.,"Naturally competent bacteria encode sophisticated protein machinery for the uptake and translocation of exogenous DNA into the cell. If this DNA is integrated into the bacterial genome, the bacterium is said to be naturally transformed. Most competent bacterial species utilise type IV pili for the initial DNA uptake step. These proteinaceous cell-surface structures are composed of thousands of pilus subunits (pilins), designated as major or minor according to their relative abundance in the pilus. Here, we show that the minor pilin FimT plays an important role in the natural transformation of Legionella pneumophila. We use NMR spectroscopy, in vitro DNA binding assays and in vivo transformation assays to understand the molecular basis of FimT's role in this process. FimT binds to DNA via an electropositive patch, rich in arginines, several of which are well-conserved and located in a conformationally flexible C-terminal tail. FimT orthologues from other Gammaproteobacteria share the ability to bind to DNA. Our results suggest that FimT plays an important role in DNA uptake in a wide range of competent species.","['Braus SAG', 'Short FL', 'Holz S', 'Stedman MJM', 'Gossert AD', 'Hospenthal MK']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Braus SAG, et al.

RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnostic testing in CAP with gram stain, lower respiratory and blood cultures, Streptococcal and Legionella urinary antigens are not routinely recommended unless identified as severe CAP or with risk factors for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Influenza virus testing remains a strong recommendation during periods of community viral spread.An additional 2021 ATS clinical practice guideline reviewed the use of molecular testing for noninfluenza viral pathogens in adults with suspected CAP and recommended testing in those hospitalized with severe CAP and/or various immunocompromising conditions.
SUMMARY: Diagnostic testing remains an important component of confirming and treating CAP. The CAP guideline includes recommendations surrounding diagnostic testing with lower respiratory gram stain and culture, blood cultures, Legionella and Pneumococcal urinary antigen, influenza viral testing and serum procalcitonin.There is a strong recommendation to obtain influenza virus testing during periods of community spread. However, the use of other diagnostics such as gram stain, lower respiratory and blood culture, and urinary antigen testing are dependent on severity of illness and whether a patient has been identified as having strong risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection. The 2021 ATS clinical practice document did not routinely recommend testing noninfluenza respiratory viruses unless identified as having severe CAP and/or various immunocompromising conditions.","['Losier A', 'Dela Cruz CS']",2022,35,2,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Losier A and Dela Cruz CS.

35224642,Requirement of phosphatidic acid binding for distribution of the bacterial protein Lpg1137 targeting syntaxin 17.,"The gram-negative bacterium, Legionella pneumophila is known to manipulate the host cellular functions. L. pneumophila secretes bacterial proteins called Legionella effectors into the host cytosol that are necessary for these manipulations. The Legionella effector Lpg1137 was identified as a serine protease responsible for the degradation of syntaxin 17 (Stx17). However, how Lpg1137 specifically recognizes and degrades Stx17 remained unknown. Given that Stx17 is localized in the ER, mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), and mitochondria, Lpg1137 likely distributes to these compartments to recognize Stx17. Here, we show that the C-terminal region of Lpg1137 binds to phosphatidic acid (PA), a MAM and mitochondria-enriched phospholipid, and that this binding is required for the correct intracellular distribution of Lpg1137. Two basic residues in the C-terminal region of Lpg1137 are required for PA binding and their mutation causes mislocalization of Lpg1137. This mutant also fails to degrade Stx17 while retaining protease activity. Taken together, our data reveal that Lpg1137 utilizes PA for its distribution to the membranous compartments in which Stx17 is localized.","['Murata M', 'Kanamori R', 'Kitao T', 'Kubori T', 'Nagai H', 'Tagaya M', 'Arasaki K']",2022,135,6,J Cell Sci,"Murata M, et al.

This study was conducted to better understand microbial water quality changes in a LEED-certified school building during low water use (Summer) and normal water use (Autumn). The copper plumbed building contained water saving devices, a hot water recirculation system, and received chloraminated drinking water from a public water system. Three separate sampling events were conducted during the summer break inside the building and another three sampling events were conducted after the school returned to session. Using quantitative PCR, Legionella spp. were detected in all water samples, followed by Mycobacterium spp. (99%). Mycobacterium avium (75%) and Acanthamoeba spp. (17.5%) throughout the building water system. Legionella pneumophila and Naegleria fowleri were not detected in any of the samples.

Opportunistic pathogens (OPs), which are the leading cause of identified waterborne disease in the United States, are understudied in private wells. We conducted a quantitative polymerase chain reaction survey of Legionella spp., L. pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp., M. avium, Naegleria fowleri, and shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli gene markers and total coliform and E. coli in drinking water supplied by private wells following the Louisiana Floods (2016), Hurricane Harvey (2017), Hurricane Irma (2017), and Hurricane Florence (2018). Self-reported well characteristics and recovery status were collected via questionnaires. Of the 211 water samples collected, 40.3% and 5.2% were positive for total coliform and E. coli, which were slightly elevated positivity rates compared to prior work in coastal aquifers. DNA markers for Legionella and Mycobacterium were detected in 54.5% and 36.5% of samples, with L. pneumophila and M. avium detected in 15.6% and 17.1%, which was a similar positivity rate relative to municipal system surveys. Total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies were positively associated with Legionella and Mycobacterium, indicating that conditions that favor occurrence of general bacteria can also favor OPs. N. fowleri DNA was detected in 6.6% of samples and was the only OP that was more prevalent in submerged wells compared to non-submerged wells. Self-reported well characteristics were not associated with OP occurrence. This study exposes the value of routine baseline monitoring and timely sampling after flooding events in order to effectively assess well water contamination risks.","['Mapili K', 'Rhoads WJ', 'Coughter M', 'Pieper KJ', 'Edwards MA', 'Pruden A']",2022,826,,Sci Total Environ,"Mapili K, et al.

35177348,Ubiquitin and Legionella: From bench to bedside.,"Legionella pneumophila, a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium, is one of the major causes of Legionnaires' disease, a specific type of atypical pneumonia. Despite intensive research efforts that elucidated many relevant structural, molecular and medical insights into Legionella's pathogenicity, Legionnaires' disease continues to present an ongoing public health concern. Legionella's virulence is based on its ability to simultaneously hijack multiple molecular pathways of the host cell to ensure its fast replication and dissemination. Legionella usurps the host ubiquitin system through multiple effector proteins, using the advantage of both conventional and unconventional (phosphoribosyl-linked) ubiquitination, thus providing optimal conditions for its replication. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of L. pneumophila from medical, biochemical and molecular perspectives. We describe the clinical disease presentation, its diagnostics and treatment, as well as host-pathogen interactions, with the emphasis on the ability of Legionella to target the host ubiquitin system upon infection. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary use of innovative technologies enables better insights into the pathogenesis of Legionnaires' disease and provides new opportunities for its treatment and prevention.","['Tomaskovic I', 'Gonzalez A', 'Dikic I']",2022,132,,Semin Cell Dev Biol,"Tomaskovic I, et al.

35167692,"Host Adaptation in Legionellales Is 1.9 Ga, Coincident with Eukaryogenesis.","Bacteria adapting to living in a host cell caused the most salient events in the evolution of eukaryotes, namely the seminal fusion with an archaeon, and the emergence of both mitochondrion and chloroplast. A bacterial clade that may hold the key to understanding these events is the deep-branching gammaproteobacterial order Legionellales-containing among others Coxiella and Legionella-of which all known members grow inside eukaryotic cells. Here, by analyzing 35 novel Legionellales genomes mainly acquired through metagenomics, we show that this group is much more diverse than previously thought, and that key host-adaptation events took place very early in its evolution. Crucial virulence factors like the Type IVB secretion (Dot/Icm) system and two shared effector proteins were gained in the last Legionellales common ancestor (LLCA). Many metabolic gene families were lost in LLCA and its immediate descendants, including functions directly and indirectly related to molybdenum metabolism. On the other hand, genome sizes increased in the ancestors of the Legionella genus. We estimate that LLCA lived approximately 1.89 Ga, probably predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor by approximately 0.4-1.0 Gy. These elements strongly indicate that host adaptation arose only once in Legionellales, and that these bacteria were using advanced molecular machinery to exploit and manipulate host cells early in eukaryogenesis.","['Hugoson E', 'Guliaev A', 'Ammunét T', 'Guy L']",2022,39,3,Mol Biol Evol,"Hugoson E, et al.

METHODS: This case-control study included patients aged ≥16 years who were treated for Legionella pneumonia from April 2011 through March 2017 and those aged ≥16 years who were treated for non-Legionella community-acquired pneumonia from August 2014 through July 2015. Legionella pneumonia was diagnosed based on a positive result on the urinary antigen test, as well as radiographic examinations. Serum phosphate levels on admission were compared between Legionella and non-Legionella patients. In addition, serum phosphate levels on admission and on hospital day 5-7 were compared in Legionella patients.
RESULTS: We evaluated 8 Legionella patients and 61 non-Legionella patients. Median serum phosphate levels on admission were 1.90 and 2.80 mg/dL in Legionella and non-Legionella patients, respectively (

The biosensor consisted of two sets of focusing electrodes connected in parallel and three sets of interdigitated electrodes (IDE) arrays. The electrodes enabled the biosensor to concentrate and detect bacteria at both low and high concentrations. The focusing region was designed with vertical metal sidewall pairs and multiple tilted thin-film finger pairs to generate positive dielectrophoresis (p-DEP) to force the bacteria moving toward the microchannel centerline. As a result, the bacterial pathogens were highly concentrated when they reached the detection electrode arrays. The detection IDE arrays were coated with three different antibodies against the target bacterial pathogens and a cross-linker to enhance the binding of antibodies to the detection electrode. As the binding of bacterial pathogen to its specific antibodies took place, the impedance value changed. The results demonstrated that the biosensors were capable of detecting Salmonella, Legionella, and E. coli 0157:H7 simultaneously with a detection limit of 3 bacterial cells/ml in 30 - 40 min.","['Muhsin SA', 'Al-Amidie M', 'Shen Z', 'Mlaji Z', 'Liu J', 'Abdullah A', 'El-Dweik M', 'Zhang S', 'Almasri M']",2022,203,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Muhsin SA, et al.

35091225,Microbiomes in drinking water treatment and distribution: A meta-analysis from source to tap.,"A meta-analysis of existing and available Illumina 16S rRNA datasets from drinking water source, treatment and drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) were collated to compare changes in abundance and diversity throughout. Samples from bulk water and biofilm were used to assess principles governing microbial community assembly and the value of amplicon sequencing to water utilities. Individual phyla relationships were explored to identify competitive or synergistic factors governing DWDS microbiomes. The relative importance of stochasticity in the assembly of the DWDS microbiome was considered to identify the significance of source and treatment in determining communities in DWDS. Treatment of water significantly reduces overall species abundance and richness, with chlorination of water providing the most impact to individual taxa relationships. The assembly of microbial communities in the bulk water of the source, primary treatment process and DWDS is governed by more stochastic processes, as is the DWDS biofilm. DWDS biofilm is significantly different from bulk water in terms of local contribution to beta diversity, type and abundance of taxa present. Water immediately post chlorination has a more deterministic microbial assembly, highlighting the significance of this process in changing the microbiome, although elevated levels of stochasticity in DWDS samples suggest that this may not be the case at customer taps. 16S rRNA sequencing is becoming more routine, and may have several uses for water utilities, including: detection and risk assessment of potential pathogens such as those within the genera of Legionella and Mycobacterium; assessing the risk of nitrification in DWDS; providing improved indicators of process performance and monitoring for significant changes in the microbial community to detect contamination. Combining this with quantitative methods like flow cytometry will allow a greater depth of understanding of the DWDS microbiome.","['Thom C', 'Smith CJ', 'Moore G', 'Weir P', 'Ijaz UZ']",2022,212,,Water Res,"Thom C, et al.

35088956,[Legionella Species Isolated in the Water Systems of Ships and Their Molecular Characterization].,"Legionella species are generally found in nature and in water resources, and they are gram negative bacilli that can cause pneumonia by being transmitted from water systems to humans via aerosol or aspiration. Legionnaires' disease caused by this agent continues to be a public health problem in cruise ships. In this study, it was aimed to determine the prevalence of the colonization of Legionella species by culture method and to determine the molecular characterization of the isolated Legionella in water samples taken from the water systems of the ships docking in Mersin International Port. A total of 158 cold water samples were taken from 18 ferry and/or cargo ships docking in Mersin International Port between December 2014 and June 2015. Fifty-four of the samples were obtained from tanks, 68 from taps and 36 from shower heads. All samples were centrifuged and inoculated from the pellet onto ""Buffered Coal Yeast Extract"" (BCYE) (Oxoid, CM0655, UK) agar medium supplemented with iron pyrophosphate, L-cysteine and α-ketoglutarate (Oxoid, SR0110, UK). The culture plates were incubated for 10-15 days in microaerophilic environment in a desiccator at 37°C. The suspicious colonies grown in cultures were serogrouped by latex agglutination test (Oxoid, DR0800M, UK) and fluorescent antibody method (m-Tech Monoclonal Technologies, Inc., USA). For the molecular analysis of Legionella species grown in culture, DNA isolation was made from Legionella colonies and then polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using specific primer sequences targeting the rpoB gene region of the Legionella genome. Direct DNA sequencing of rpoB gene products was performed in the ""ABI PRISM 3130XL Genetic Analyzer"" (Applied Biosystems, USA). The DNA sequences were typed by BLAST analysis and the determined types, and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) reference Legionella sequences were phylogenetically compared with the Neighbor-Joining comparison method by using the Mega 7 program. Legionella spp. was isolated in 18 (11.4%) of 158 samples. Of these, four (7.4%, 4/54) were detected from the tank, 11 (16.2%, 11/68) from the tap and three (8.33%, 3/36) from the shower head. After the latex agglutination test performed from the growing bacterial colonies, five (27.8%) were serogrouped as Legionella spp., four (22.2%) as Legionella pneumophila sg 5, two (11.1%, each) as L.pneumophila sg 1,L.pneumophila sg 8 and Legionella bozemanii and one (5.6%) as L.pneumophila sg 3. Two (11.1%) of the isolates grown in culture could not be serogrouped. Molecular characterization of 12 Legionella isolates could be performed. One of them was serologically serogrouped as L.bozemanii, and it was found to be 99% similar to Legionella rubrilucens when compared with NCBI Legionella sequence data in the BLAST program. One isolate that could not be differentiated by serogrouping was identified as Legionella erytra in the BLAST program after DNA sequence analysis. The remaining 10 isolates (55.6%, n= 18) were confirmed as L.pneumophilia after the comparison with reference NCBI sequences. In this study, it was determined that 11.4% of the water samples collected from the water systems of the ships docking in Mersin International Port were contaminated with Legionella species. The detected Legionella species have an important potential source of infection for the captain, ship workers and passengers travelling on the ships. In this respect, this study reveals the necessity of establishing studies to improve the risk management of Legionella in the water systems of ships.","['Ülger M', 'Tezcan Ülger S', 'Bekçi A', 'Nar Ötgün S', 'Delialioğlu N', 'Aslan G']",2022,56,1,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Ülger M, et al.

CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first describing the distribution of Legionella spp. in non-hospital facilities in the province of Pesaro-Urbino, and highlights a condition of potential risk for susceptible categories. From our data, we can point that a regular and constant control to prevent microbiological risk from legionellosis, particularly in facilities housing the elderly, is recommended.","['Sabatini L', 'Sisti M', 'Campana R']",2022,34,2,Ann Ig,"Sabatini L, et al.

35024770,Detection and quantification of the vacuolar H+ATPase using the Legionella effector protein SidK.,"Acidification of secretory and endocytic organelles is required for proper receptor recycling, membrane traffic, protein degradation, and solute transport. Proton-pumping vacuolar H+ ATPases (V-ATPases) are responsible for this luminal acidification, which increases progressively as secretory and endocytic vesicles mature. An increasing density of V-ATPase complexes is thought to account for the gradual decrease in pH, but available reagents have not been sufficiently sensitive or specific to test this hypothesis. We introduce a new probe to localize and quantify V-ATPases. The probe is derived from SidK, a Legionella pneumophila effector protein that binds to the V-ATPase A subunit. We generated plasmids encoding fluorescent chimeras of SidK1-278, and labeled recombinant SidK1-278 with Alexa Fluor 568 to visualize and quantify V-ATPases with high specificity in live and fixed cells, respectively. We show that V-ATPases are acquired progressively during phagosome maturation, that they distribute in discrete membrane subdomains, and that their density in lysosomes depends on their subcellular localization.","['Maxson ME', 'Abbas YM', 'Wu JZ', 'Plumb JD', 'Grinstein S', 'Rubinstein JL']",2022,221,3,J Cell Biol,"Maxson ME, et al.

35008007,Blockade of Cycloxygenase-2 ameliorates sepsis induced immune-suppression by regulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells.,"BACKGROUND: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and cyclooxy-genase-2 (COX-2)/Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) axis are important contributors to sepsis-induced immune-suppression. The purpose of present study is to explore whether COX-2 inhibitor can improve immunological disorder after sepsis via regulating MDSCs.
METHODS: A ''two-hit'' model reflecting clinical sepsis development was performed. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and Legionella pneumophila infection were used as the first and the second hit, respectively. NS398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, was utilized to treat septic mice. The motality, bacterial counts in the lung, systematic inflammatory reaction and CD4 + T cells response after sepsis were assessed, so as the frequency and function of MDSCs. In some experiments, the number of MDSCs was manipulated by adoptive transfer or neutralizing antibody before induction of secondary infection.
RESULTS: Mice surviving CLP showed a marked expansion and activation of MDSCs in spleen, accompanied by suppressed proliferating capability, impaired secreting functionand increased apoptosis of CD4 + T cells. Majority of CLP survivors became succumbed to L. pneumophila invasion, associated with defective bacteria elimination ability. NS398 treatment was found to ameliorate these adverse outcomes significantly.
CONCLUSION: MDSCs contribute greatly to the sepsis-induced immune dysfunction. Inhibiting COX-2 may become a promising therapy that targets MDSCs-induced immunosuppression.","['Chen J', 'Cai S', 'Li R', 'Xie J', 'Yang F', 'Liu T']",2022,104,,Int Immunopharmacol,"Chen J, et al.

34996350,Multiple Cross Displacement Amplification Coupled with Lateral Flow Biosensor (MCDA-LFB) for rapid detection of Legionella pneumophila.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila is an opportunistic waterborne pathogen of significant public health problems, which can cause serious human respiratory diseases (Legionnaires' disease). Multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA), a isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique, has been applied in the rapid detection of several bacterial agents. In this report, we developed a MCDA coupled with Nanoparticles-based Lateral Flow Biosensor (MCDA-LFB) for the rapid detection of L. pneumophila.
RESULTS: A set of 10 primers based on the L. pneumophila specific mip gene to specifically identify 10 different target sequence regions of L. pneumophila was designed. The optimal time and temperature for amplification are 57 min and 65 °C. The limit of detection (LoD) is 10 fg in pure cultures of L. pneumophila. No cross-reaction was obtained and the specificity of MCDA-LFB assay was 100%. The whole process of the assay, including 20 min of DNA preparation, 35 min of L. pneumophila-MCDA reaction, and 2 min of sensor strip reaction, took a total of 57 min (less than 1 h). Among 88 specimens for clinical evaluation, 5 (5.68%) samples were L. pneumophila-positive by MCDA-LFB and traditional culture method, while 4(4.55%) samples were L. pneumophila-positive by PCR method targeting mip gene. Compared with culture method, the diagnostic accuracy of MCDA-LFB method was higher.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the L. pneumophila-MCDA-LFB method we successfully developed is a simple, fast, reliable and sensitive diagnostic tool, which can be widely used in basic and clinical laboratories.","['Jiang L', 'Gu R', 'Li X', 'Song M', 'Huang X', 'Mu D']",2022,22,1,BMC Microbiol,"Jiang L, et al.

34972680,Diagnostic accuracy of urinary antigen tests for legionellosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Urinary antigen tests (UATs) have been used for the early detection of legionellosis and have demonstrated moderate sensitivity and high specificity. However, the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2009 evaluated the accuracy of UATs; since then, UAT accuracy may have changed owing to advances and developments in UAT technology and epidemiological changes in the frequency of Legionella species that cause legionellosis. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to update the accuracy of UATs for legionellosis among patients with suspected pneumonia.
METHODS: Overall, 1326 studies were screened, 21 of which fulfilled the eligibility criteria for quality assessment and meta-analysis. Data from 5772 patients, including 1368 (23.7%) with the target condition (i.e., suspected legionellosis), were included in the analysis. The overall quality of the included studies, which was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, was unclear.
RESULTS: The calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.85) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.00), respectively. Subpopulation analysis revealed that the accuracy of UATs for sensitivity and specificity for Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78-0.91) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.00), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of UATs were moderate and high, respectively, which is comparable to the results reported in 2009. Therefore, UATs may be a useful method for the early detection of legionellosis caused by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1.

34941180,Clinical features of patients with Legionnaires disease showing initial clinical improvement but radiological deterioration: A retrospective single-center analysis.,"Patients with Legionnaires disease occasionally experience initial clinical improvement but radiological progression. However, data on this issue are so far limited. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in chest radiograph findings in patients with Legionnaires disease who showed initial clinical improvement and to identify risk factors and outcomes in these patients.All patients diagnosed with Legionnaires disease at a tertiary hospital in South Korea between March 2011 and May 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Legionnaires disease was defined as abnormal chest radiographs accompanied by a positive finding on at least one of the following tests: urinary antigen test, sputum Legionella polymerase chain reaction, and sputum Legionella culture. Clinical improvement was defined as defervescence and decreased C-reactive protein level. Clinical and radiological records were reviewed on treatment days 7 and 14 and at discharge. We describe the characteristics of patients with clinical improvement but radiological deterioration on treatment for Legionnaires disease and compared them with patients with initial clinical improvement and stable or resolving chest radiograph findings.Of 140 patients with Legionnaires disease, 33 (24%) showed initial clinical deterioration, while the remaining 107 (76%) showed initial clinical improvement on day 7. The latter 107 patients were analyzed in this study; 22 (21%) showed radiological progression despite the clinical improvement. Risk factors for these patients were a high pneumonia severity index score and the use of mechanical ventilation. Mortality did not significantly differ between those with initial clinical improvement but radiological deterioration and those with both initial clinical and radiological improvement (28% vs 12%, P = .49).About one-fifth of patients with Legionnaires disease, especially those who had a high pneumonia severity index score and underwent mechanical ventilation, showed radiological deterioration despite of clinical improvement 1 week after appropriate treatment, while outcomes were not significantly worse in these patients. Therefore, our findings support that close monitoring without modification of antibiotics use is warranted in those who have clinical improvement regardless of radiologic findings.","['Kim J', 'Park S', 'Yang E', 'Kim H', 'Seo H', 'Chung H', 'Jung J', 'Kim MJ', 'Chong YP', 'Lee SO', 'Choi SH', 'Kim YS', 'Kim SH']",2021,100,51,Medicine (Baltimore),"Kim J, et al.

34933785,National survey of physicians in Japan regarding their use of diagnostic tests for legionellosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Bacterial culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of legionellosis. However, past reports indicate that most physicians use the urinary antigen test (UAT) alone. Combining it with other tests is important, especially in patients with negative UAT results. The aim of this study was to investigate the current situation of legionellosis diagnostics and clarify the issues that need to be addressed.
METHODS: Between March 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, a questionnaire survey was conducted in an anonymous manner among physicians working in Japan. Questionnaires were generated on a website and asked questions in a multiple-choice format.
RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 309 physicians during the study period. Most (92.9%) physicians reported using UAT as the initial test for patients suspected of having legionellosis, and <10% reported using other tests (e.g., culture, nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT], Gimenez staining, and serum antibody titer measurement [ATM]). When the initial test result was negative, 63% of physicians reported not conducting additional tests. Even when they chose to run additional tests, at most 27.8%, 23.6%, 12.3%, and 10.4% of all physicians used NAAT, culture, Gimenez staining, and serum ATM, respectively.

Cases of LD have been on the rise in the U.S. and globally. Although Legionella was first identified 45 years ago, it remains an 'emerging pathogen."" Legionella is part of the normal ecology of a public water system and is frequently detected in regulatory-compliant drinking water. Drinking water utilities, regulators and public health alike are increasingly required to have a productive understanding of the evolving issues and complex discussions of the contribution of the public water utility to Legionella exposure and LD risk. This review provides a brief overview of scientific considerations important for understanding this complex topic, a review of findings from investigations of public water and LD, including data gaps, and recommendations for professionals interested in investigating public water utilities. Although the current literature is inconclusive in identifying a public water utility as a sole source of an LD outbreak, the evidence is clear that minimizing growth of Legionella in public water utilities through proper maintenance and sustained disinfectant residuals, throughout all sections of the water utility, will lead to a less conducive environment for growth of the bacteria in the system and the buildings they serve.","['Gleason JA', 'Cohn PD']",2022,240,,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Gleason JA and Cohn PD.

34909504,Legionella contamination of a cold-water supplying system in a German university hospital - assessment of the superheat and flush method for disinfection.,"INTRODUCTION: In case of a contamination of water-supplying systems in hospitals with legionella, usually chemical disinfection measures are used for remediation. Unfortunately, it is reported, that these methods may not be sustainable, have an impact on water quality, and can even fail. As an alternative, the superheat and flush method does not need any special equipment, can be initiated in a short lead of time and does not affect the water quality. However, evidence on this disinfection measurement against legionella is lacking. We therefore investigated and report on the effectiveness and long-term results of the superheat and flush disinfection method.
METHODS: During routine periodical examinations, a rising count of legionella was detected in the cold-water supplying system at a German university hospital. Adapted to an analysis of risks, effort and benefit, the superheat and flush procedure was applied twice within 6 months.
RESULTS: While 33 out of 70 samples had a higher legionella count than the legal threshold of 100 CFU/100 mL (CFU - Colony Forming Units) before the first disinfection was carried out, this number could be reduced to 1 out of 202 samples after the first intervention. Additionally, in contrast to previously published studies, the effect was long-lasting, as no relevant limit exceedance occurred during the following observation period of more than two years.
CONCLUSION: The superheat and flush disinfection can provide an economic and highly effective measure in case of legionella contamination and should be shortlisted for an eradication attempt of affected water-supplying systems in hospitals.","['Unterberg M', 'Rahmel T', 'Kissinger T', 'Petermichl C', 'Bosmanns M', 'Niebius M', 'Schulze C', 'Jochum HP', 'Parohl N', 'Adamzik M', 'Nowak H']",2021,62,3,J Prev Med Hyg,"Unterberg M, et al.

It can be found in various aquatic environments ranging from cooling towers to ponds. In addition to causing disease in humans, it can also infect free-living amoebae commonly found in various aquatic environments. Once inside a human lung macrophage, it creates a niche called the Legionella-containing vacuole where it can evade phagolysosomal degradation and replicate. During infection, normal cellular functions are hijacked by proteins that are secreted by the pathogen, called bacterial effectors. Here, the structural characterization of the effector LegA15/AnkD is reported. The protein contains an ankyrin-repeat domain followed by a cysteine protease-like (CPL) domain with a putative catalytic triad consisting of His268-Asn290-Cys361. The CPL domain shows similarity to the CE clan in the MEROPS database, which contains ubiquitin-like hydrolases. The C-terminal segment of LegA15, including the CPL domain, shows structural similarity to another effector, LegA3/AnkH, while they share only 12% sequence identity. When expressed in mammalian cells, LegA15 is localized within the cytoplasm, in contrast to LegA3, which localizes to the nucleus.","['Chung IYW', 'Li L', 'Cygler M']",2021,77,Pt 12,Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,"Chung IYW, et al.

34858868,Idiosyncratic Biogenesis of Intracellular Pathogens-Containing Vacuoles.,"While most bacterial species taken up by macrophages are degraded through processing of the bacteria-containing vacuole through the endosomal-lysosomal degradation pathway, intravacuolar pathogens have evolved to evade degradation through the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. All intra-vacuolar pathogens possess specialized secretion systems (T3SS-T7SS) that inject effector proteins into the host cell cytosol to modulate myriad of host cell processes and remodel their vacuoles into proliferative niches. Although intravacuolar pathogens utilize similar secretion systems to interfere with their vacuole biogenesis, each pathogen has evolved a unique toolbox of protein effectors injected into the host cell to interact with, and modulate, distinct host cell targets. Thus, intravacuolar pathogens have evolved clear idiosyncrasies in their interference with their vacuole biogenesis to generate a unique intravacuolar niche suitable for their own proliferation. While there has been a quantum leap in our knowledge of modulation of phagosome biogenesis by intravacuolar pathogens, the detailed biochemical and cellular processes affected remain to be deciphered.

37223249,Patho-epigenetics: histone deacetylases as targets of pathogens and therapeutics.,"In recent years, the interplay of epigenetics and infection moved into the limelight. Epigenetic regulation describes modifications in gene expression without alterations of the DNA sequence. In eukaryotes, this mechanism is central for fundamental cellular processes such as cell development and differentiation, but it is also involved in more specific tasks such as the response to infection by a pathogen. One of the most common types of epigenetic changes is the modification of histones. Histones, the small protein building blocks that are wrapped with DNA are the fundamental packaging unit of chromatin. Histones can be modified by linking different moieties to them-one of the most abundant ones is acetylation. Histone acetylation is regulated by two main classes of enzymes, histone acetyl transferases (HAT) and their counterparts, histone deacetylases (HDAC). Given the high abundance and importance in regulating gene expression, histone acetylation is an excellent target for pathogens to manipulate the host cell to their advantage. Targeting HDACs gained particular interest in recent years, due to the increased use of HDAC inhibitors in clinical practice. Recently, the possibility to fight an infection with HDAC inhibitors was suggested as an alternative to overcome the ever-growing problem of antibiotic resistance. In this review, we focus on the regulation of HDACs and their involvement in immune cell function. We then highlight different mechanisms employed by pathogens to manipulate histone deacetylases and we discuss the possibility of HDAC inhibitors as therapeutics to fight infections.","['Schator D', 'Gomez-Valero L', 'Buchrieser C', 'Rolando M']",2021,2,,Microlife,"Schator D, et al.

34838530,Comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes in Acanthamoeba after ingestion of Legionella pneumophila and Escherichia coli.,"Acanthamoeba spp. feeds on bacteria, fungi, and algae to obtain nutrients from the environment. However, several pathogens can survive and multiply in Acanthamoeba. Mechanisms necessary for the survival and proliferation of microorganisms in Acanthamoeba remain unclear. The object of this study was to identify effective factors for the survival of microorganisms in Acanthamoeba. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in A. castellanii infected by Legionella pneumophila or Escherichia coli were identified based on mRNA sequencing. A total of 2342 and 1878 DEGs were identified in Acanthamoeba with L. pneumophila and E. coli, respectively. Among these DEGs, 502 were up-regulated and 116 were down-regulated in Acanthamoeba infected by L. pneumophila compared to those in Acanthamoeba feed on E. coli. Gene ontology analysis showed that the genes encoded small GTPase-mediated signal transduction proteins in the biological process domain, intracellular proteins in the cellular component domain, and ATP binding proteins in the molecular function domain were up-regulated while integral components of membrane proteins in the cellular component domain were down-regulated in Acanthamoeba infected by Legionella compared to those in Acanthamoeba feed on E. coli. During endosymbiosis with Legionella, Acanthamoeba showed various changes in the expression of genes supposed to be involved in phagosomal maturation. Acanthamoeba infected by Legionella also showed high expression levels of aminotransferase, methyltransferase, and cysteine proteinase but low expression levels of RNA pseudouridine synthase superfamily protein and 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase superfamily. These results provide directions for further research to understand the survival strategy of L. pneumophila in A. castellanii.","['Moon EK', 'Kim MJ', 'Lee HA', 'Quan FS', 'Kong HH']",2022,232,,Exp Parasitol,"Moon EK, et al.

34826345,IRF3 inhibits IFN-γ-mediated restriction of intracellular pathogens in macrophages independently of IFNAR.,"Macrophages use an array of innate immune sensors to detect intracellular pathogens and to tailor effective antimicrobial responses. In addition, extrinsic activation with the cytokine IFN-γ is often required as well to tip the scales of the host-pathogen balance toward pathogen restriction. However, little is known about how host-pathogen sensing impacts the antimicrobial IFN-γ-activated state. It was observed that in the absence of IRF3, a key downstream component of pathogen sensing pathways, IFN-γ-primed macrophages more efficiently restricted the intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila and the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This effect did not require IFNAR, the receptor for Type I IFNs known to be induced by IRF3, nor the sensing adaptors MyD88/TRIF, MAVS, or STING. This effect also did not involve differential activation of STAT1, the major signaling protein downstream of both Type 1 and Type 2 IFN receptors. IRF3-deficient macrophages displayed a significantly altered IFN-γ-induced gene expression program, with up-regulation of microbial restriction factors such as Nos2. Finally, we found that IFN-γ-primed but not unprimed macrophages largely excluded the activated form of IRF3 from the nucleus following bacterial infection. These data are consistent with a relationship of mutual inhibition between IRF3 and IFN-γ-activated programs, possibly as a component of a partially reversible mechanism for modulating the activity of potent innate immune effectors (such as Nos2) in the context of intracellular infection.","['Maciag K', 'Raychowdhury R', 'Smith K', 'Schneider AM', 'Coers J', 'Mumbach MR', 'Schwartz S', 'Hacohen N']",2022,112,2,J Leukoc Biol,"Maciag K, et al.

Legionella utilizes a Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to translocate over 300 effector proteins into its host cell. In a recent study, we have isolated and solved the cryo-EM structure of the Type IV Coupling Complex (T4CC), a large cytoplasmic determinant associated with the inner membrane that recruits effector proteins for delivery to the T4SS for translocation. The T4CC is composed of a DotLMNYZ hetero-pentameric core from which the flexible IcmSW module flexibly protrudes. The DotY and DotZ proteins were newly reported members of this complex and their role remained elusive. In this study, we observed the effect of deleting DotY and DotZ on T4CC stability and localization. Furthermore, we found these two proteins are co-dependent, whereby the deletion of DotY resulted in DotZ absence from the coupling complex, and vice versa. Additional cryo-EM data analysis revealed the dynamic movement of the IcmSW module is modified by the DotY/Z proteins. We therefore determined the likely function of DotY and DotZ and revealed their importance on T4CC function.","['Macé K', 'Meir A', 'Lukoyanova N', 'Liu L', 'Chetrit D', 'Hospenthal MK', 'Roy CR', 'Waksman G']",2022,117,2,Mol Microbiol,"Macé K, et al.

The most common causative organisms of atypical pneumonia are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella species. The therapeutic approach for atypical pneumonias is different than that for typical pneumonia. Typical bacterial pathogens classically respond to β-lactam antimicrobial therapy because they have a cell wall amenable to β-lactam disruption. On the contrary, most atypical pathogens do not have a bacterial cell wall, some are intracellular (e.g., Legionella), and some are paracellular (e.g., M. pneumoniae). To prevent an increase in the number of antimicrobial-resistant strains, the Japanese pneumonia guidelines have proposed a differential diagnosis for typical bacterial pneumonia and atypical pneumonia to select an appropriate antibiotic for the management of mild-to-moderate pneumonia. The guidelines have set up six parameters and criteria based on the clinical symptoms, physical signs, and laboratory data. However, in the elderly individuals and patients with underlying diseases, the differential diagnosis may be difficult or a mixed infection may be latent. Therefore, in these individuals, the administration of a β-lactam drug plus a macrolide or tetracycline, or only fluoroquinolone should be considered from the beginning to cover bacterial and atypical pneumonia.",['Miyashita N'],2022,60,1,Respir Investig,"Miyashita N.

One such protein, SdhA, maintains the integrity of the vacuolar membrane, thereby preventing cytoplasmic degradation of bacteria. We show here that SdhA binds and blocks the action of OCRL (OculoCerebroRenal syndrome of Lowe), an inositol 5-phosphatase pivotal for controlling endosomal dynamics. OCRL depletion results in enhanced vacuole integrity and intracellular growth of a sdhA mutant, consistent with OCRL participating in vacuole disruption.

The goal of this study was to assess if there was deterioration in biological quality of drinking water due to these disruptions. This study characterized the microbial composition of drinking water following HM across nine drinking water systems (DWSs) in PR and utilized an extended temporal sampling campaign to determine if changes in the drinking water microbiome were indicative of HM associated disturbance followed by recovery. In addition to monitoring water chemistry, the samples were subjected to culture independent targeted and non-targeted microbial analysis including quantitative PCR (qPCR) and genome-resolved metagenomics. The qPCR results showed that residual disinfectant was the major driver of bacterial concentrations in tap water with marked decrease in concentrations from early to late sampling timepoints.

34702826,Structural basis for protein glutamylation by the Legionella pseudokinase SidJ.,"Legionella pneumophila (LP) avoids phagocytosis by secreting nearly 300 effector proteins into the host cytosol. SidE family of effectors (SdeA, SdeB, SdeC and SidE) employ phosphoribosyl ubiquitination to target multiple host Rab GTPases and innate immune factors. To suppress the deleterious toxicity of SidE enzymes in a timely manner, LP employs a metaeffector named SidJ. Upon activation by host Calmodulin (CaM), SidJ executes an ATP-dependent glutamylation to modify the catalytic residue Glu860 in the mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (mART) domain of SdeA. SidJ is a unique glutamylase that adopts a kinase-like fold but contains two nucleotide-binding pockets. There is a lack of consensus about the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of SidJ. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of SidJ in complex with its substrate SdeA in two different states of catalysis. Our structures reveal that both phosphodiesterase (PDE) and mART domains of SdeA make extensive contacts with SidJ. In the pre-glutamylation state structure of the SidJ-SdeA complex, adenylylated E860 of SdeA is inserted into the non-canonical (migrated) nucleotide-binding pocket of SidJ. Structure-based mutational analysis indicates that SidJ employs its migrated pocket for the glutamylation of SdeA. Finally, using mass spectrometry, we identified several transient autoAMPylation sites close to both the catalytic pockets of SidJ. Our data provide unique insights into the substrate recognition and the mechanism of protein glutamylation by the pseudokinase SidJ.","['Adams M', 'Sharma R', 'Colby T', 'Weis F', 'Matic I', 'Bhogaraju S']",2021,12,1,Nat Commun,"Adams M, et al.

34695417,The unity of opposites: Strategic interplay between bacterial effectors to regulate cellular homeostasis.,"Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular pathogen that uses the Dot/Icm Type IV secretion system (T4SS) to translocate many effectors into its host and establish a safe, replicative lifestyle. The bacteria, once phagocytosed, reside in a vacuolar structure known as the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) within the host cells and rapidly subvert organelle trafficking events, block inflammatory responses, hijack the host ubiquitination system, and abolish apoptotic signaling. This arsenal of translocated effectors can manipulate the host factors in a multitude of different ways. These proteins also contribute to bacterial virulence by positively or negatively regulating the activity of one another. Such effector-effector interactions, direct and indirect, provide the delicate balance required to maintain cellular homeostasis while establishing itself within the host. This review summarizes the recent progress in our knowledge of the structure-function relationship and biochemical mechanisms of select effector pairs from Legionella that work in opposition to one another, while highlighting the diversity of biochemical means adopted by this intracellular pathogen to establish a replicative niche within host cells.","['Iyer S', 'Das C']",2021,297,6,J Biol Chem,Iyer S and Das C.

The emergence of compact germicidal ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) may enable their incorporation into confined spaces to inhibit bacterial surface colonization on inaccessible surfaces, such as those in premise plumbing. Such applications necessitate knowledge of the quantitative response of biofilm growth rates to UV exposure on continuously irradiated surfaces. Herein, we performed experiments at varying flow cell temperatures in order to control baseline biofilm growth rates in the absence of UV; then, biofilm growth was compared under the same conditions but with simultaneous UVC irradiation. The inhibiting effect of UV irradiation on biofilm growth kinetics was diminished by more favorable growth conditions (higher temperature).

34620473,"Sequence-based typing of clinical and environmental Legionella pneumophila isolates in Shenyang, China.","INTRODUCTION: We performed SBT (sequence-based typing) on clinical and environmental Legionellapneumophila isolates in Shenyang (China). We analyzed and compared the results with those obtained by PFGE (pulsed field gel electrophoresis).
METHODS: Twenty-two L. pneumophila isolates were collected from two patients with L. pneumophila infection, two hospitals, and 13 office buildings. There were two clinical isolates, one strain isolated from domestic tap water, another from shower water and 18 strains from cooling tower water. All these isolates were analyzed by SBT and PFGE methods.
RESULTS: The 22 isolates were divided into 7 types by SBT. Five isolates belonged to novel sequence types (ST2345, ST2344, ST2406, ST2407, and ST2408) and one isolate belonged to ST328. The STs were not obtained for two of the isolates. The remaining 14 isolates belonged to ST1. PFGE typing divided the 22 isolates into 14 pulsotypes. The main pulsotype was SYC, which included seven isolates.
CONCLUSION: Both typing methods showed that predominant clonal lines exist in the Shenyang region, with high levels of genetic polymorphisms. Five novel STs were identified, indicating a unique genetic composition of L. pneumophila strains in this region, which are significantly different from those found in other environmental water systems in the world.","['Jiang L', 'Zhao S', 'Cai X', 'Mu D', 'Zhang X', 'Kang J', 'Zhao L', 'Chen Y']",2021,39,8,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin (Engl Ed),"Jiang L, et al.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 123 clinical respiratory samples including 63 pleural aspirates, 57 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and 3 sputum were collected from 65 males and 58 females with pneumonia symptoms. All samples were cultured on the Modified Wadowsky-Yee (MWY) agar. The Legionella species was identified by routine bacteriological tests. The presence of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer region gene was investigated by real-time PCR. The Legionella species were differentiated by sequencing of 16S-23S rRNA gene. A total of 2 (1.6%) BAL specimens were positive for Legionella species by culture method. No Legionella spp. were identified in pleural aspirates and sputum samples by the culture method. Using real-time PCR, 9 (7.3%) samples including 6 BAL, 1 sputum, and 2 pleural aspirates were positive for legionella species. These species were detected in 3 (5.2%) females and 6 males (9.2%). The results of sequencing showed that eight species were L. pneumophila while one was L. cherrii. Also, the 2 isolates that were identified by culture method, were confirmed as L. pneumophila by sequencing.

The aim of this study was to describe the rates and features of co-infection on admission of COVID-19 patients, based on molecular and routine laboratory methods.
METHODS: A retrospective study of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients undergoing Biofire
RESULTS: FilmArray tests were performed in 115 COVID-19 and in 61 non-COVID-19 patients. Most (>99%) COVID-19 patients had moderate-critical illness, 37% required mechanical ventilation. Sputa and endotracheal aspirates were the main samples analyzed. Positive FilmArray tests were found in 60% (70/116) of the tests amongst COVID-19 patients and 62.5% (40/64) amongst non-COVID-19 patients. All 70 cases were positive for bacterial targets, while one concomitant virus (

34552934,Interactions and Cytotoxicity of Human Neurodegeneration- Associated Proteins Tau and α-Synuclein in the Simple Model Dictyostelium discoideum.,"The abnormal accumulation of the tau protein into aggregates is a hallmark in neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies. In normal conditions, tau binds off and on microtubules aiding in their assembly and stability dependent on the phosphorylation state of the protein. In disease-affected neurons, hyperphosphorylation leads to the accumulation of the tau protein into aggregates, mainly neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) which have been seen to colocalise with other protein aggregates in neurodegeneration. One such protein is α-synuclein, the main constituent of Lewy bodies (LB), a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In many neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, the colocalisation of tau and α-synuclein has been observed, suggesting possible interactions between the two proteins.

34543123,The Legionella pneumophila Effector RavY Contributes to a Replication-Permissive Vacuolar Environment during Infection.,"Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease and is capable of replicating inside phagocytic cells, such as mammalian macrophages. The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system is a L. pneumophila virulence factor that is essential for successful intracellular replication. During infection, L. pneumophila builds a replication-permissive vacuole by recruiting multiple host molecules and hijacking host cellular signaling pathways, a process mediated by the coordinated functions of multiple Dot/Icm effector proteins. RavY is a predicted Dot/Icm effector protein found to be important for optimal L. pneumophila replication inside host cells. Here, we demonstrate that RavY is a Dot/Icm-translocated effector protein that is dispensable for axenic replication of L. pneumophila but critical for optimal intracellular replication of the bacteria. RavY is not required for avoidance of endosomal maturation, and RavY does not contribute to the recruitment of host molecules found on replication-permissive vacuoles, such as ubiquitin, RAB1a, and RTN4.

METHODS: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed at three Belgian University Hospitals, between 1 January 2016 up to 31 January 2019. Hospital-acquired LD was defined as symptom onset at 10 days or more after admission, according to the Centres for Disease Control and prevention. Community-acquired LD was defined as diagnosis at admission or within 10 days after admission.
RESULTS: Fifty patients were included in the study, among them 26% were diagnosed with hospital-acquired LD. The case-fatality rate was 22%, with eight of the eleven deceased patients (73%) being in the hospital-acquired LD group. Medical history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at diagnosis were more frequently observed in the hospital-acquired LD group. Furthermore, significantly lower SOFA score at diagnosis of LD and higher rates of treatment with levofloxacin or moxifloxacin were observed in survivors.
CONCLUSION: In the current cohort, LD death-rate was mainly driven by hospital-acquired LD patients. Hospital-acquired LD might especially affect patients with chronic respiratory disease.

METHODS: From March to May 2020, 201 patients suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were surveyed for etiologies by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR: FilmArray TM Respiratory Panel) test combination with cultural method, viral antigen detection and serologic surveys.
RESULTS: Total 201 patients tested with FilmArray TM Respiratory Panel were enrolled, of which 68.2% had sputum bacterial culture, 86.1% had pneumococcus and Legionella urine antigen test. Their median age was 72.0 year-old with multiple comorbidities, and 11.4% were nursing home residents. Bacteria accounted for 59.7% of identified pathogens. Atypical pathogens were identified in 31.3% of total pathogens, of which viruses accounted for 23.9%. In comparison to patients with bacterial infection, patients with atypical pathogens were younger (median= 77.2 vs 67.1, years, P = 0.017) and had shorter length of hospital (8.0 vs 4.5, days, P = 0.007).

34472525,High proportion of drug-resistant isolates in adult community-acquired pneumonia from Northeast India: A hospital-based study.,"BACKGROUND: Empirical antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of management of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) globally. Knowledge of prevalent pathogen (bacterial) profile and drug susceptibility pattern is very essential for appropriate management of CAP cases, which again calls for regular update of pathogen profile in a given locality. This study was to identify the bacterial etiology of CAP cases and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done on adult CAP patients from medicine, respiratory medicine, and intensive care unit area in our tertiary care hospital between May 1, 2015, and October 30, 2016. Subjects were enrolled continuously, and expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and blood culture were performed. Urine antigen test was done for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Three types of ELISA (IgM, IgG, and IgA) were performed for atypical agents (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella) of CAP. Isolates obtained from culture of Sputum/BAL/Blood were further processed for antibiotic susceptibility testing - by disc diffusion as well as E-test method (latter for MIC i.e. minimum inhibitory concentration, determination).
RESULTS: About 574 subjects were included, and in 266 (46.3%) cases, bacterial pathogen could be detected. Klebsiella pneumoniae (33.6%) and S. pneumoniae (32.9%) were the predominant agents identified. Atypical agents (Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydia) were at 15.1%. A high proportion of pneumococci isolates were multidrug resistant (52.6%). Resistance to beta-lactams, macrolide, and other agents was on the higher side, but fluoroquinolones were found to be less resistant (15.8%-21.1%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (among Klebsiella isolates) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were also detected.
CONCLUSION: A moderate-to-high degree of drug-resistant in adult CAP was evident, which is detrimental in effective empirical management of such cases. Urgent implementation of antibiotic stewardship scheme is the need of the hour.","['Kalita D', 'Sarma RK', 'Sharma KR', 'Deka S']",2021,38,5,Lung India,"Kalita D, et al.

A murine sepsis model was established by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP), according to the Minimum Quality Threshold in Pre-Clinical Sepsis Studies (MQTiPSS) guidelines. The bone marrow and spleen of the mice were collected at 24 h, 72 h, 7 and 15 d after sepsis induction.

Then, we have investigated whether swertianolin could modulate the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs in in vitro experiments. G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs increased acutely after sepsis with high levels sustained over a long period of time. G-MDSCs were the main subtype identified in the murine model of sepsis with polymicrobial peritonitis. Furthermore, it was found that swertianolin reduced significantly interleukin-10 (IL-10), nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and arginase production in MDSCs, while reducing MDSC proliferation and promoting MDSC differentiation into dendritic cells. Swertianolin also improved T-cell activity by blocking the immunosuppressive effect of MDSCs.

The purpose of this study was to compare the growth dynamics of bacterial OPs and related genera (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella spp., L. pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp., and M. avium), two amoebal hosts (Acanthamoeba spp. and Vermamoeba vermiformis), and the fecal indicator Escherichia coli in simulated rainwater and tap water storage systems (SWSSs). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) analysis of target microorganisms in SWSS influents and effluents demonstrated that P. aeruginosa and Legionella thrived in rainwater, but not in tap water. V. vermiformis proliferated in both rainwater and tap water polyvinyl chloride (PVC) SWSSs, while mycobacteria were largely absent in rainwater SWSSs. Tank materials exerted stronger influence on target microorganisms in rainwater SWSSs relative to tap water SWSSs, with species-specific responses noted in bulk water and biofilm. For instance, P. aeruginosa and V. vermiformis had the highest gene copy numbers in PVC rainwater SWSS effluents and biofilm, while Legionella peaked in stainless steel rainwater SWSS effluents and PVC rainwater SWSS biofilm. These results highlighted the OP contamination risks in rainwater storage systems and provided insights into rainwater system design and operation in terms of OP control.","['Zhang X', 'Xia S', 'Ye Y', 'Wang H']",2021,204,,Water Res,"Zhang X, et al.

In this study, we examined the efficacy of SAIW, a unique electrolyzed water with chlorine-free, high pH, high concentration of dissolved hydrogen, and low oxygen reduction potential, for the inactivation of several viruses and bacteria. Infectivity assays revealed that initial viral titers of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, human coronavirus, feline calicivirus, and canine parvovirus, were reduced by 2.9- to 5.5-log10 within 30 s of SAIW exposure. Similarly, the culturability of three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Legionella) dropped down by 1.9- to 4.9-log10 within 30 s of SAIW treatment. Mechanistically, treatment with SAIW was found to significantly decrease the binding and subsequent entry efficiencies of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero cells. Finally, we showed that this chlorine-free electrolytic ion water had no acute inhalation toxicity in mice, demonstrating that SAIW holds promise for a safer antiviral and antibacterial disinfectant.","['Suzuki Y', 'Hishiki T', 'Emi A', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Itamura R', 'Yamamoto R', 'Matsuzawa T', 'Shimotohno K', 'Mizokami M', 'Nakano T', 'Yamamoto N']",2021,575,,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Suzuki Y, et al.

34445973,Evaluation of the Genmark ePlex® and QIAstat-Dx® respiratory pathogen panels in detecting bacterial targets in lower respiratory tract specimens.,"BACKGROUND: The ePlex® and QIAstat-Dx® respiratory pathogen panels detect multiple respiratory pathogens, mainly viruses but also Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis. The assays have been marketed for use in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. For diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens are indicated. Aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of these syndromic panels for these three bacterial targets in samples from the LRT. Fifty-six specimens were collected from our repositories, five negative samples and fifty-one samples which had been previously tested positive with the routine diagnostic real-time PCR assays for Legionella spp. (N = 20), Bordetella spp. (N = 16) or M. pneumoniae (N = 15).
RESULTS: The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel V2 (RP) assay detected all of the L. pneumophila and B. pertussis positive samples but only 11/15 (73.3 %) of the M. pneumoniae targets. The ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) assay detected 10/14 (71.4 %) of the L. pneumophila targets, 8/12 (66.7 %) of the B. pertussis positive samples and 13/15 (86.7 %) of the M. pneumoniae targets.
CONCLUSIONS: No false-positive results were reported for all three bacterial pathogens by both assays. The clinical performance of both assays depended highly on the bacterial load in the sample and the type of specimen under investigation.","['van Asten SAV', 'Boers SA', 'de Groot JDF', 'Schuurman R', 'Claas ECJ']",2021,21,1,BMC Microbiol,"van Asten SAV, et al.

34436993,Legionella Pneumonia on Point-of-care Ultrasound in the Emergency Department: A Case Report.,"INTRODUCTION: Legionella is an uncommon, atypical organism that can cause community-acquired pneumonia. Commonly associated with high fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hyponatremia, it can be easily overlooked, especially during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Legionella has specific antibiotic treatment that will improve outcome; thus, its recognition is important.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of Legionella pneumonia in a man presenting with shortness of breath and fever. The patient's initial chest radiography was negative. With the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) the changes of atypical pneumonia could be seen. Ultimately Legionella was confirmed with urine antigen testing, and appropriate antibiotic treatment was started.
DISCUSSION: Given the increased awareness of COVID-19 it is important to consider a broad differential with respiratory illness. Legionella pneumonia on POCUS is consistent with atypical pneumonia descriptions on ultrasound. Point-of-care ultrasound can be used to diagnose atypical pneumonia, specifically caused by Legionella in our case.
CONCLUSION: Legionella is evident on POCUS but is difficult to distinguish from other infections with POCUS alone. One should consider Legionella if POCUS is positive for signs of atypical infection.","['Lopez RW', 'Hysell MK', 'Long JP', 'Longobardi J']",2021,5,2,Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,"Lopez RW, et al.

In vitro data establish lefamulin's activity against a number of Gram-positive, Gram-negative and atypical organisms relevant in the treatment of CABP, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Two phase-3 studies, the Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia trials, established non-inferiority of lefamulin against moxifloxacin in the treatment of CABP, including the sequential transition from intravenous to oral therapy and across a broad set of patient demographics and severities. Pooled and post hoc analyses have confirmed these effects for a variety of subgroups and secondary endpoints. Real-world study data post-approval have largely not yet emerged for lefamulin, and there is a need for further investigation into safety/efficacy for off-label indications such as acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and sexually transmitted infections.

Drinking water distribution systems harbor various microbiota despite efforts made in improving water infrastructures in the water industry, especially, in developing countries. Intermittent water supply, long time of water storage, low water pressure, and contaminated source water are among many of the factors responsible for poor drinking water quality affecting health of people. The aim of this study was to explore microbial diversity and structure in water samples collected from source water, treated water, reservoirs, and household points of use locations (taps). High-throughput Illumina sequencing technology was employed by targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the V1-V3 region of the 18S rRNA gene to analyze the microbial community structure. Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were the core dominating taxa. Gammaproteobacteria was also dominant among other proteobacterial classes across all sampling points. Opportunistic bacterial genera such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Klebsiella, Escherichia, and Actinobacteria, as well as eukaryotic microbes like Cryptosporidium, Hartmannella, Acanthamoeba, Aspergillus, and Candida were also abundant taxa found along the distribution systems. The shift in microbial community structure from source to point of use locations was influenced by basic factors such as residual chlorine, intermittent water supply, and long-time storage at the household. The complex microbiota detected in different sampling sites in this study brings drinking water quality problem which further causes significant health problems to both human and animal health. Treatment ineffectiveness, disinfection inefficiency, poor maintenance actions, leakage of sewage, and other domestic wastes are few among many other factors responsible for degraded drinking water quality in this study putting health at high risk. Findings of this research provide important and baseline information to understand the microbial profiles of drinking water along source water and distribution systems.

However, the Legionella effector SidJ adopts a kinase fold, yet catalyzes calmodulin (CaM)-dependent glutamylation to inactivate the SidE ubiquitin ligases. The structural and mechanistic basis in which the kinase domain catalyzes protein glutamylation is unknown. Here we present cryo-EM reconstructions of SidJ:CaM:SidE reaction intermediate complexes. We show that the kinase-like active site of SidJ adenylates an active-site Glu in SidE, resulting in the formation of a stable reaction intermediate complex. An insertion in the catalytic loop of the kinase domain positions the donor Glu near the acyl-adenylate for peptide bond formation. Our structural analysis led us to discover that the SidJ paralog SdjA is a glutamylase that differentially regulates the SidE ligases during Legionella infection. Our results uncover the structural and mechanistic basis in which the kinase fold catalyzes non-ribosomal amino acid ligations and reveal an unappreciated level of SidE-family regulation.","['Osinski A', 'Black MH', 'Pawłowski K', 'Chen Z', 'Li Y', 'Tagliabracci VS']",2021,81,21,Mol Cell,"Osinski A, et al.

34374500,Metabolic evolutionary roots of the macrophage immune response in amoeba-bacteria interactions: The conserved role of hypoxia-induced Factor and AMP kinase.,"The bacteria Legionella, being able to infect both macrophages and protozoans, reduce oxidative phosphorylation and induce glycolysis, which allows pathogens to grow and replicate in these cells. In amoeba-like inflammatory macrophages (M1), the phagocytizing cells of the primary immune defense, an increase in the rate of glycolysis is followed by a decrease of oxidative phosphorylation. The opposite takes place in anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2). They change from glycolysis to oxidative metabolism when AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) is activated by a high ratio of AMP/ATP. Stimulation of macrophages with anti-inflammatory cytokines causes activation of AMPK. Infection of macrophages with the parasitic flagellate Leishmania infantum induces a switch from an initial glycolytic phase to oxidative phase with the essential role of AMPK in this change. Activated AMPK induces catabolic pathways effectively producing ATP as well as processes requiring the energy supply. AMPK regulates the migration of cells and enhances the phagocytic activity of macrophages. In macrophages, bacterial products activate TLRs and NF-κB signaling, causing an increase of transcription of hypoxia-induced factor HIF-1α (a subunit of HIF-1). This brings about induction of the enzyme and transporter expression essential for glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway to proceed and makes biosynthetic processes and ROS production in macrophages possible. Hypoxia augments macrophage phagocytosis in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Multicellular parasites experience changes in the availability of oxygen in their life cycle. In the nematode Ascaris suum, HIF participates in the pre-adaptation to hypoxic conditions after infection of their hosts. Also, the freshwater and marine invertebrates meet changes of oxygen concentrations. In the anaerobic branch of the respiratory chain of these invertebrates, fumarate serves as the terminal electron acceptor that is reduced to succinate in complex II of the ETC. In mammalian cells, accumulation of succinate under hypoxic conditions suggests that the mammalian complex II may reduce fumarate to succinate, too. The data reviewed here show that the ability to shift the cell metabolism towards glycolysis observed in activated macrophages can be traced back in evolution to metabolic changes characterizing protozoans infected with bacteria. Anabolic needs of multiplying bacteria direct host metabolism to glycolysis that produces, aside from ATP, precursors of the amino acids used by the pathogen for its protein synthesis. M1-activated mammalian macrophages behave in the same way. Regulation of metabolism in M1 and M2 macrophages is further enhanced by HIF-1 and AMPK, respectively. These archaic functions of AMPK and HIF, important also to control phagocytosis and cell migration were extended to embryonic development in multicellular organisms.",['Dzik J'],2021,68,3,Acta Biochim Pol,Dzik J.

Some bacteria preyed by FLA are called amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB), as they can resist to lysosomal fusion and are capable of multiplying and evading FLA after internalization, propagating in the environment. Despite the health risks due to the existence of pathogenic and opportunistic species that are ARB and the pathogenicity of some FLA species, there are no water quality protocols to analyze the presence of ARB or FLA. In this sense, our study aimed to isolate FLA through amoebal enrichment and to identify ARB using amoebal coculture in water samples from a public park and two hospitals in southern Brazil. As a result, 9 different microorganisms genera have been identified through amoebal coculture, including fastidious Legionella spp. and Bosea vestrisii. From the positive samples for FLA, by amoebal enrichment, Acanthamoeba spp., Vermamoeba vermiformis and Naegleria spp. were identified in 14 amoebic isolates.

34340073,Characterizing the premise plumbing microbiome in both water and biofilms of a 50-year-old building.,"The premise plumbing portion of drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) has several characteristics that may favor microbial growth in the form of biofilms. These microbial communities are implicated as infectious sources for the spread of opportunistic waterborne pathogens by supporting their complex ecology and transmission through DWDS outlets to susceptible individuals. However, there is limited understanding of the drinking water biofilms in real premise plumbing networks due to challenges with accessibility. Using a combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, this study comprehensively characterized the premise plumbing microbiome of a 50-year-old university building, inclusive of water and biofilm samples. Microbial diversity in the water samples were more taxonomically diverse in comparison to the mature drinking water biofilms, which were dominated with biofilm-formers and opportunistic pathogens, such as Mycobacterium spp. A model opportunistic pathogen, Legionella spp., was only detectable in water samples using quantitative PCR but could not be detected in any of the drinking water biofilms using either qPCR or culture-dependent approaches, highlighting the limitations of detection methods in these environments. This study presents preliminary findings on the microbial dynamics and complexity in premise plumbing networks, which may support public health management and the development of strategies to eliminate microbial risks to human health.","['Huang CK', 'Weerasekara A', 'Bond PL', 'Weynberg KD', 'Guo J']",2021,798,,Sci Total Environ,"Huang CK, et al.

We wanted to determine how frequently L. longbeachae DNA was present on gardeners' gloves, and how long L. longbeachae could persist on inoculated gloves and masks. Volunteers completed a survey of gardening practices and their gardening gloves were tested for L. longbeachae DNA by qPCR. The persistence of viable L. longbeachae was assessed by timed subcultures after inoculation of gardening gloves and masks. Gloves but not masks were used regularly. L. longbeachae was detected on 11 (14%; 95% CI 8-24%) gloves. Viable organisms were recovered from 25-50% of inoculated cotton, leather and PU coated gloves but not rubber gloves after 8 h incubation. There was a difference in dose-response curve slopes by glove material (P = 0·001) and time to 50% sterility (P = 0·036). There were differences in persistence of L. longbeachae between mask types from analysis of the slopes and 50% sterility on the decay curves (P = 0·042, P < 0·001 respectively). Gardening gloves and masks may act as a vector for transmission of L. longbeachae during gardening.

34322616,Assessment of hygienic conditions of recreational facility restrooms: an integrated approach.,"INTRODUCTION: Microbiological quality of recreational environments included restrooms, is generally assessed by water and surface monitoring. In this study, an environmental monitoring, conducted in spring, of swimming pool restrooms of a recreation center located in the Marche region has been carried out. Seven water samples and seven surface swabs were collected. Moreover, six air samples have been included. The aim of this study was to evaluate if air microbiological monitoring, along with molecular detection in real-time PCR, could give additional useful information about the hygienic conditions of the facility.
METHODS: Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) both at 22°C (psychrophilic) and 37°C (mesophilic) was determined by separate cultures in all samples. The presence of Legionella pneumophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was evaluated by both culture and real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The analysis of shower water recorded a HPC load of mesophilic bacteria (37°C) more than 10-fold higher in men restroom, respect to women's one (> 100 vs < 10 CFU/ml), while in air samples was between < 100 and > 500. Concerning pathogen presence, both species Legionella pneumophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected only in men restroom, but in different sample types by using different methods (culture and real-time PCR).
CONCLUSIONS: Air sampling may offer the advantage of giving more representative data about microbial presence in restrooms, including bacterial species transmitted through aerosol, like Legionella. Moreover, the concurrent use of molecular and microbiological detection in an integrated approach could offer the advantage of greater sensitivity.","['Schiavano GF', 'Baldelli G', 'Ceppetelli V', 'Brandi G', 'Amagliani G']",2021,62,1,J Prev Med Hyg,"Schiavano GF, et al.

The results revealed that the CFX bind with FEZ-1 in stronger interaction and induced larger conformational change than PV, despite all being forced by the electrostatic interaction and along with the changing in an environment of amino acid residues as well as the polypeptide skeleton inside the FEZ-1. Moreover, only the loop1, loop2, and N-terminal were observed locating near the binding pocket of FEZ-1, consisting of a flexible ""gate-like"" zone with better adaptability that controlled the entrance of antibiotic into the pocket by allowing the newly introduced antibiotic to match the pocket better through the conformational changes of these three substructures in the binding procedure. The current study may provide some valuable information on the antibiotic hydrolytic process by metallo-beta-lactamase and thus the references for the development of new antibiotics for super bacteria.","['Dong X', 'Xue P', 'Ma X', 'Bai Y', 'Shi P', 'Bian L']",2021,149,,Enzyme Microb Technol,"Dong X, et al.

34311369,Quantification of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes in backyard and commercial composts.,"Compost is widely used for gardening. Growers can choose to buy compost from markets or make compost at home. Potential exposure of users to pathogens through composting includes ingesting foodborne pathogens and inhaling airborne pathogens. This study compared the abundances of the genetic markers of five opportunistic foodborne and airborne pathogens in the backyard and commercial composts, as well as an immature swine mortality compost. We found that ttrC of Salmonella enterica and ftsZ of Escherichia coli were absent from all ready-to-use compost samples. In contrast, the genes of airborne pathogens such as groEL2 of Mycobacterium spp., mip of Legionella pneumophila, and gyrB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in the backyard and commercial composts. The groEL2 gene of Mycobacterium spp. was detected in all samples, including the control soil. The abundance of gyrB of P. aeruginosa was high in the two backyard composts, and it was higher than those in any other compost samples. The relative abundances of ARGs were significantly lower in backyard composts than commercial composts. We found that ftsZ of E. coli co-existed with multiple single-drug resistant ARGs in the immature swine mortality compost. We also found that mip of L. pneumophila and gyrB of P. aeruginosa co-existed with aminoglycoside resistance genes. Our findings suggest that inhaling airborne pathogens may carry more risk than ingesting foodborne pathogens when applying composts.","['Mao Y', 'Akdeniz N', 'Nguyen TH']",2021,797,,Sci Total Environ,"Mao Y, et al.

34303751,A new MALDI-TOF approach for the quick sequence type identification of Legionella pneumophila.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, MALDI-TOF has emerged as a quick tool for bacterial typing. The aim was to evaluate if MALDI-TOF based typing of Legionella pneumophila can achieve the same discriminatory power as that of the Sequence Based Typing (SBT) method.
METHODS: The Sequence Type (ST) was obtained from the 90 strains included in the training set and an in-house MALDI-TOF library based on the Main Spectra Profile (MSP) was generated for the identification of such ST. Then, our library was validated by three procedures: a) creating a dendrogram, b) searching for specific peaks present exclusively in each MSP entry, and c) analysing a validation set composed of 14 strains with known ST. Fully characterized L. pneumophila ATCC 33152, which belongs to ST 36, was used as a control strain.
RESULTS: In the training set, 17 strains belonged to ST 1, 1 to ST 20, 63 to ST 22, 1 to ST 146, 6 to ST 578, and 2 to ST 1086. Specific peaks present in each MSPs spectrum, which are considered type-specific biomarkers, ranged from 2 to 11; more concretely, MSP for ST 1 identification shows 2 specific peaks; MSP for ST 20 identification: 9 specific peaks; MSP for ST 22 and ST 36 identification: 11 specific peaks; MSP for ST 146 identification: 5 specific peaks; and MSP for ST 578 and ST 1086 identification: 3 specific peaks. Using the validation set (nine strains belonging to ST 22 and five to ST 1), MALDI-TOF assigned accurately the ST in 30 min per tested strain with a full match.
CONCLUSIONS: The ST of L. pneumophila can be identified and reported in few minutes directly from colonies grown on BCYE agar using MALDI-TOF.","['Blanco S', 'Sanz C', 'Gutiérrez MP', 'Simarro M', 'López I', 'Escribano I', 'Eiros JM', 'Zarzosa P', 'Orduña A', 'López JC', 'March GA']",2021,188,,J Microbiol Methods,"Blanco S, et al.

34287033,Coinfections with Other Respiratory Pathogens among Patients with COVID-19.,"Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals are at an increased risk for coinfections; therefore, physicians need to be cognizant about excluding other treatable respiratory pathogens. Here, we report coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in patients admitted to the coronavirus disease (COVID) care facilities of an Indian tertiary care hospital. From June 2020 through January 2021, we tested 191 patients with SARS-CoV-2 for 33 other respiratory pathogens using an fast track diagnostics respiratory pathogen 33 (FTD-33) assay. Additionally, information regarding other relevant respiratory pathogens was collected by reviewing their laboratory data. Overall, 13 pathogens were identified among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 46.6% (89/191) of patients had coinfection with one or more additional pathogens. Bacterial coinfections (41.4% [79/191]) were frequent, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and Pneumocystis jirovecii or Legionella pneumophila were also identified. The viral coinfection rate was 7.3%, with human adenovirus and human rhinovirus being the most common. Five patients in our cohort had positive cultures for Acinetobacter baumannii and K. pneumoniae, and two patients had active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In total, 47.1% (90/191) of patients with coinfections were identified. The higher proportion of patients with coinfections in our cohort supports the systemic use of antibiotics in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with rapid de-escalation based on respiratory PCR/culture results. The timely and simultaneous identification of coinfections can contribute to improved health of COVID-19 patients and enhanced antibiotic stewardship during the pandemic.

34285384,Serine-ubiquitination regulates Golgi morphology and the secretory pathway upon Legionella infection.,"SidE family of Legionella effectors catalyze non-canonical phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination (PR-ubiquitination) of host proteins during bacterial infection. SdeA localizes predominantly to ER and partially to the Golgi apparatus, and mediates serine ubiquitination of multiple ER and Golgi proteins. Here we show that SdeA causes disruption of Golgi integrity due to its ubiquitin ligase activity. The Golgi linking proteins GRASP55 and GRASP65 are PR-ubiquitinated on multiple serine residues, thus preventing their ability to cluster and form oligomeric structures. In addition, we found that the functional consequence of Golgi disruption is not linked to the recruitment of Golgi membranes to the growing Legionella-containing vacuoles. Instead, it affects the host secretory pathway. Taken together, our study sheds light on the Golgi manipulation strategy by which Legionella hijacks the secretory pathway and promotes bacterial infection.","['Liu Y', 'Mukherjee R', 'Bonn F', 'Colby T', 'Matic I', 'Glogger M', 'Heilemann M', 'Dikic I']",2021,28,10,Cell Death Differ,"Liu Y, et al.

34272205,The evolution of rapid antigen detection systems and their application for COVID-19 and other serious respiratory infectious diseases.,"Making the correct diagnosis of a patient seeking medical attention is the ultimate goal of a practicing physician, irrespective of whether the cause of the patient's condition is infectious or non-infectious. Antigen detection tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of various infectious-related disorders including COVID-19 where it has become especially important due to the serious nature of this disease and its worldwide prevalence. These tests closely mimic one of the earliest prototypes - the urine pregnancy test - and as a result they have gained wide acceptance based on their overall simplicity, low cost and relative accuracy. In some situations, especially as a screening test, they can be used instead of the more technically demanding and complex molecular and serologic assays that are still useful and helpful under many different circumstances. Antigen detection systems are based on finding a particular immunogenic component, typically a protein or polysaccharide molecule, that is both unique and an integral part of the pathogen or other biological entity. Because these tests generally provide only qualitative results, they often need to be supplemented with other and sometimes more sophisticated laboratory-based diagnostic procedures to corroborate the initial test result. In this review, we first describe general background information on antigen-detection methods, including any unique aspects of their overall design, and then follow with an extensive description on the merits and limitations of these tests for detecting COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, for other serious respiratory diseases caused by three common bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.","['S Pavia C', 'M Plummer M']",2021,54,5,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,S Pavia C and M Plummer M.

34256647,A solution for global hygienic challenges regarding the application of heater-cooler systems in cardiac surgery.,"71.759 surgical procedures were performed in 2019 with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass in Germany. To adjust the patient's body temperature on extracorporeal circulation, the application of a heater-cooler unit (HCU) is mandatory. However, in case of insufficient sanitisation of HCU, life-threatening infections can be transmitted by the device to the patients, including Legionella bacteria, Mycobacterium chimaera, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To avoid disease transmission, as a requirement for safe medical practice established by regulatory authorities, HCUs must be regularly disinfected by hazardous chemicals posing a danger for both handling humans and the environment. Therefore, to comply with regulations, HCU manufacturers have introduced both timely and financially extensive sanitisation procedures. Our paper describes a novel, effective and easy to handle disinfection method for the above problematics without utilising hazardous chemicals. The method's technical principle is electrolysis, resulting in drinking water quality regarding the analysed germs in the worldwide most commonly utilised heater-cooler device. The main aim of the study was to prove the efficacy and reliability of the device cleansing process. Furthermore, the economic impact of the novel method was evaluated. Therefore, we have undertaken 60 microbiological sampling series between December 2019 and November 2020 from a conventional HCU (3T LivaNova, Germany). During the total investigational period, no contamination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Legionellae could have been demonstrated in the HCU. The extreme slow-growing nontuberculous M. chimaera was detected only in one sample obtained from diamond electrode cleansed HCU water, and source of contamination was promptly eliminated by a simple technical modification of the device test-site. Additionally, the diamond electrode application is beneficial for eliminating potentially hazardous cleansing material from the process, which may affect otherwise both patients operated on cardiopulmonary bypass and the perfusionists.","['Foltan M', 'Nikisch A', 'Dembianny J', 'Miano AL', 'Heinze J', 'Klar D', 'Göbölös L', 'Lehle K', 'Schmid C']",2023,38,1,Perfusion,"Foltan M, et al.

34254252,Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Lefamulin.,"Lefamulin (Xenleta) has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). It may be taken intravenously or orally and has activity against a broad range of pulmonary pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Chlamydophila pneumonia, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Lefamulin has an adverse effect profile that is similar to other antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat CABP. Despite these promising features, the use of lefamulin remains limited in clinical practice. However, given the rise of antibiotic-resistant organisms, this may soon change.

34252427,Integrated approach for legionellosis risk analysis in touristic-recreational facilities.,"Legionellosis is a severe pneumonia caused by the inhalation of aerosols containing Legionella, Gram-negative bacteria present in the water systems of touristic-recreational facilities. The purpose of this study was to develop a scoring tool to predict the risk of both environmental contamination and Legionnaires' disease cases in such facilities in the Apulia region of southern Italy. We analyzed 47 structural and management parameters/risk factors related to the buildings, water systems, and air conditioning at the facilities. A Poisson regression model was used to compute an overall risk score for each facility with respect to three outcomes: water samples positive for Legionella (risk score range: 7-54), water samples positive for Legionella with an average load exceeding 1000 colony-forming units per liter (CFU/L) (risk score range: 22-179,871), and clinical cases of Legionnaire's disease (risk score range: 6-31). The cut-off values for three outcomes were determined by receiver operating characteristic curves (first outcome, samples positive for Legionella in a touristic-recreational facility: 19; second outcome, samples positive for Legionella in a touristic-recreational facility with an average load exceeding 1000 CFU/L: 2062; third outcome, clinical cases of Legionnaire's disease in a touristic-recreational facility: 22). Above these values, there was a significant probability of observing the outcome. We constructed this predictive model using 70% of a large dataset (18 years of clinical and environmental surveillance) and tested the model on the remaining 30% of the dataset to demonstrate its reliability.

34241791,A Combined Immunofluorescence and Fluorescent Viability Cocktail Staining Procedure for Rapid Microscopic Detection and Enumeration of Live Legionella pneumophila.,"This report describes a combined immunofluorescence and fluorescence viability stain applied as one staining solution for rapid detection of live Legionella pneumophila in mixed bacterial populations. Instead of sequential viability staining with the Invitrogen BacLight LIVE/DEAD staining kit followed by antibody-Alexa Fluor (AF) 647 conjugate staining to identify live L. pneumophila, a combined single cocktail solution staining protocol was developed to simplify and accelerate the time to detection of viable L. pneumophila serogroup-1 (SG-1) in mixed species populations on a filter membrane. The stain cocktail will aid in accelerating fluorescence microscopic analysis of cooling tower, air conditioner and water fountain or other liquid samples for the presence of L. pneumophila and its viability status. Visibly red stained cells were identified as dead non-L. pneumophila SG-1 cells, while green fluorescing cells represented viable non-L. pneumophila SG-1 cells. Due to also staining red with antibody-AF 647, L. pneumophila SG-1 cells were pseudocolorized as blue to distinguish them from other dead cells. Fluorescence color emission mixing from the viability dyes (SYTO 9 and propidium iodide) with antibody-AF 647 stained L. pneumophila led to other fluorescent colors. For example, green plus pseudocolorized blue AF 647-antibody- labeled cells were identified as live cyan-colored L. pneumophila SG-1 cells. Magenta-colored cells resulted from dead L. pneumophila cells that combined red propidium iodide with blue pseudocolorized AF 647-antibody emissions. Analysis of measured RGB (red, green, blue) color values in microscopic images of mixed bacterial populations suggests the possibility of facile automated discrimination of subpopulations of live and dead L. pneumophila and non-L. pneumophila species by computers in 3-dimensional RGB color space after staining in the combined cocktail which will save time for more rapid microscopic detection of potential sources of Legionnaire's disease.","['John JJ', 'May CJ', 'Bruno JG']",2021,31,5,J Fluoresc,"John JJ, et al.

Samples were collected from six points: a residential and recreational area, an industrial area, an informal residential settlement, a point next to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), a pumping station, and a residential and agricultural farming area along the river. High bacterial counts recorded on general selective and differential culture media signify substantial microbial contamination along the sampling sites. The most prevalent bacterial phyla detected (through metagenomics analyses) along the sampling sites were Proteobacteria (61%), Planctomycetes (9.5%), Firmicutes (7.8%), Bacteroidetes (5%), Acidobacteria (4.6%), and Actinobacteria (4.6%). Some members of the identified predominant bacterial phyla, genera, and classes are important public health bacteria that have been implicated in human diseases and outbreaks, while some others are metal or hydrocarbon tolerant, indicating possible significant environmental pollution. Notable human pathogenic genera such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Shigella, Legionella, Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas were identified in varying percentages at five of the six sampling areas. Fecal contamination was particularly rife at all residential areas, with the informal housing area being the most notably polluted. Diverse functional pathways were predicted for identified bacteria, such as those associated with different chronic and infectious human diseases as well as those related to hydrocarbon and metal remediation. The point next to a WWTP contained vastly diverse groups of bacterial contaminants as well as the most abundant pathway identities and titles.","['Alegbeleye O', 'Alisoltani A', 'Abia ALK', 'Awe AA', 'Adetunji AT', 'Rabiu S', 'Opeolu BO']",2021,66,6,Folia Microbiol (Praha),"Alegbeleye O, et al.

34184807,Legionella pneumophila LegC7 effector protein drives aberrant endoplasmic reticulum:endosome contacts in yeast.,"Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen, causing the severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Legionella actively alters host organelle trafficking through the activities of ""effector"" proteins secreted via a type-IVB secretion system, in order to construct the bacteria-laden Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) and prevent lysosomal degradation. The LCV is created with membrane derived from host endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secretory vesicles and phagosomes, although the precise molecular mechanisms that drive its synthesis remain poorly understood. In an effort to characterize the in vivo activity of the LegC7/YlfA SNARE-like effector protein from Legionella in the context of eukaryotic membrane trafficking in yeast, we find that LegC7 interacts with the Emp46p/Emp47p ER-to-Golgi glycoprotein cargo adapter complex, alters ER morphology and induces aberrant ER:endosome interactions, as measured by visualization of ER cargo degradation, reconstitution of split-GFP proteins and enhanced oxidation of the ER lumen. LegC7-dependent toxicity, disruption of ER morphology and ER:endosome fusion events were dependent upon endosomal VPS class C tethering complexes and the endosomal t-SNARE, Pep12p. This work establishes a model in which LegC7 functions to recruit host ER material to the bacterial phagosome during infection by driving ER:endosome contacts, potentially through interaction with host membrane tethering complexes and/or cargo adapters.","['Glueck NK', ""O'Brien KM"", 'Seguin DC', 'Starai VJ']",2021,22,8,Traffic,"Glueck NK, et al.

Currently, Denmark is experiencing one of the highest annual incidences of LD despite its relatively cold climate and homogenous population, and the incidence differs notably across the country.AimWe sought to determine whether provincial differences in LD incidence are attributable to the age and sex distribution of the population, and to characterise the risk of LD by province and age group in Denmark.MethodsUsing national routine surveillance data for domestic LD cases collected between 2015 and 2018, we assessed the incidence of disease by province and year. Poisson regression models were fit to understand the risk of LD by year and province, as well as by 5-year age groups.ResultsIncidence of domestic LD increased 48% between 2015 and 2018 across Denmark. Some provinces continuously had a high incidence of disease, even after adjusting for yearly trends and the underlying population distribution. Variations in the proportion of the population aged 65 years and older were not responsible for the increase in disease in our analysis. Finally, incidence of disease increased with each 5-year age group in both men and women.ConclusionsThe relative differences in incidence between Danish provinces could not be explained by the age and sex distribution of the population, indicating that other factors must be responsible for the varying incidence across the country. These results may help inform trends in other countries in Europe also experiencing an unexplained high incidence of LD.","['Cassell K', 'Thomas-Lopez D', 'Kjelsø C', 'Uldum S']",2021,26,25,Euro Surveill,"Cassell K, et al.

34161398,A novel viral strategy for host factor recruitment: The co-opted proteasomal Rpn11 protein interaction hub in cooperation with subverted actin filaments are targeted to deliver cytosolic host factors for viral replication.,"Positive-strand (+)RNA viruses take advantage of the host cells by subverting a long list of host protein factors and transport vesicles and cellular organelles to build membranous viral replication organelles (VROs) that support robust RNA replication. How RNA viruses accomplish major recruitment tasks of a large number of cellular proteins are intensively studied. In case of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), a single viral replication protein, named p33, carries out most of the recruitment duties. Yet, it is currently unknown how the viral p33 replication protein, which is membrane associated, is capable of the rapid and efficient recruitment of numerous cytosolic host proteins to facilitate the formation of large VROs. In this paper, we show that, TBSV p33 molecules do not recruit each cytosolic host factor one-by-one into VROs, but p33 targets a cytosolic protein interaction hub, namely Rpn11, which interacts with numerous other cytosolic proteins. The highly conserved Rpn11, called POH1 in humans, is the metalloprotease subunit of the proteasome, which couples deubiquitination and degradation of proteasome substrates. However, TBSV takes advantage of a noncanonical function of Rpn11 by exploiting Rpn11's interaction with highly abundant cytosolic proteins and the actin network. We provide supporting evidence that the co-opted Rpn11 in coordination with the subverted actin network is used for delivering cytosolic proteins, such as glycolytic and fermentation enzymes, which are readily subverted into VROs to produce ATP locally in support of VRO formation, viral replicase complex assembly and viral RNA replication. Using several approaches, including knockdown of Rpn11 level, sequestering Rpn11 from the cytosol into the nucleus in plants or temperature-sensitive mutation in Rpn11 in yeast, we show the inhibition of recruitment of glycolytic and fermentation enzymes into VROs. The Rpn11-assisted recruitment of the cytosolic enzymes by p33, however, also requires the combined and coordinated role of the subverted actin network. Accordingly, stabilization of the actin filaments by expression of the Legionella VipA effector in yeast and plant, or via a mutation of ACT1 in yeast resulted in more efficient and rapid recruitment of Rpn11 and the selected glycolytic and fermentation enzymes into VROs. On the contrary, destruction of the actin filaments via expression of the Legionella RavK effector led to poor recruitment of Rpn11 and glycolytic and fermentation enzymes. Finally, we confirmed the key roles of Rpn11 and the actin filaments in situ ATP production within TBSV VROs via using a FRET-based ATP-biosensor. The novel emerging theme is that TBSV targets Rpn11 cytosolic protein interaction hub driven by the p33 replication protein and aided by the subverted actin filaments to deliver several co-opted cytosolic pro-viral factors for robust replication within VROs.","['Molho M', 'Lin W', 'Nagy PD']",2021,17,6,PLoS Pathog,"Molho M, et al.

34120381,A horizontally acquired Legionella genomic island encoding a LuxR type regulator and effector proteins displays variation in gene content and regulation.,"The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila translocates >300 effector proteins into host cells, many of which are regulated at the transcriptional level. Here, we describe a novel L. pneumophila genomic island, which undergoes horizontal gene transfer within the Legionella genus. This island encodes two Icm/Dot effectors: LegK3 and a previously uncharacterized effector which we named CegK3, as well as a LuxR type regulator, which we named RegK3. Analysis of this island in different Legionella species revealed a conserved regulatory element located upstream to the effector-encoding genes in the island. Further analyses, including gene expression analysis, mutagenesis of the RegK3 regulatory element, controlled expression studies, and gel-mobility shift assays, all demonstrate that RegK3 directly activates the expression levels of legK3 and cegK3 effector-encoding genes. Additionally, the expression of all the components of the island is silenced by the Fis repressors. Comparison of expression profiles of these three genes among different Legionella species revealed variability in the activation levels mediated by RegK3, which were positively correlated with the Fis-mediated repression. Furthermore, LegK3 and CegK3 effectors moderately inhibit yeast growth, and importantly, they have a strong synergistic inhibitory effect on yeast growth, suggesting these two effectors are not only co-regulated but also might function together.","['Linsky M', 'Segal G']",2021,116,3,Mol Microbiol,Linsky M and Segal G.

34109500,Diagnostic performance of four SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in patients with COVID-19 or with bacterial and non-SARS-CoV-2 viral respiratory infections.,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays are used for epidemiological studies and for the assessment of vaccine responses in highly vulnerable patients. So far, data on cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is limited. Here, we compared four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs; Vircell SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 207 patients with COVID-19, 178 patients with serological evidence of different bacterial infections, 107 patients with confirmed viral respiratory disease, and 80 controls from the pre-COVID-19 era. In COVID-19 patients, the assays showed highest sensitivity in week 3 (Vircell-IgM/A and Euroimmun-IgA: 78.9% each) and after week 7 (Vircell-IgG: 97.9%; Euroimmun-IgG: 92.1%). The antibody indices were higher in patients with fatal disease. In general, IgM/IgA assays had only limited or no benefit over IgG assays. In patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections, IgG assays were more specific than IgM/IgA assays, and bacterial infections were associated with more false-positive results than viral infections. The specificities in bacterial and viral infections were 68.0 and 81.3% (Vircell-IgM/IgA), 84.8 and 96.3% (Euroimmun-IgA), 97.8 and 86.0% (Vircell-IgG), and 97.8 and 99.1% (Euroimmun-IgG), respectively. Sera from patients positive for antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, and Legionella pneumophila yielded particularly high rates of unspecific false-positive results in the IgM/IgA assays, which was revealed by applying a highly specific flow-cytometric assay using HEK 293 T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Positive results obtained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA ELISAs require careful interpretation, especially if there is evidence for prior bacterial respiratory infections.","['Huber T', 'Steininger P', 'Irrgang P', 'Korn K', 'Tenbusch M', 'Diesch K', 'Achenbach S', 'Kremer AE', 'Werblow M', 'Vetter M', 'Bogdan C', 'Held J']",2021,40,9,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Huber T, et al.

A systemic involvement ab initio could be non-specific, leading to a diagnostic misinterpretation.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old woman had been complaining of mental confusion, restlessness, aggressiveness, and, subsequently, hirsutism. After 3 weeks, the patient developed pneumonia and died during the hospitalization. The autopsy examination revealed a multi-organ necrotizing exudative disease involving the lung, the heart and the brain. The microbiological tests of tracheal aspirate were positive for Legionella pneumophila serotype 1.
CONCLUSION: The Legionella infection may show a proteiform clinical course and an extra-pulmonary manifestation may be the first sign of the disease.

However, conventional urinary antigen tests are unable to detect anything other than Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. The Ribotest Legionella (Ribotest) can detect all serogroups by using antibodies recognizing L. pneumophila ribosomal protein L7/L12 in addition to the conventional L. pneumophila serogroup 1 lipopolysaccharide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of Ribotest against conventional urinary antigen tests, including the detection of Legionellaceae other than L. pneumophila. We investigated the detection sensitivity of various kits using in-vitro culture-soluble antigen extracts of ATCC strains and 22 clinical isolates collected from multiple medical facilities in the Kinki region of Japan.

34088603,Increased risk of Legionella pneumonia as community-acquired pneumonia after heavy rainfall in 2018 in west Japan.,"INTRODUCTION: Japan experienced a heavy rainfall event from June 28 to July 8, 2018, and many casualties were caused by both heavy rainfall and flooding. Few studies have investigated patients' characteristics and the causative pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia before and after heavy rainfall events. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the causative pathogens and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia before and after the heavy rainfall event using prospective cohort data.
METHODS: The study was divided into two periods: July to November 2013-2017 (before heavy rainfall) and July to November 2018 (after heavy rainfall). The patients' clinical characteristics and causative pathogens before and after the heavy rainfall were investigated. Regarding the causative pathogens, adjustments were made for precipitation and seasonal patterns.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the number and clinical characteristics of patients before and after heavy rainfall. However, the frequency of Legionella pneumonia was significantly higher after than before the heavy rainfall event (8.9% vs 3.0%, P = 0.02) and remained significant after adjusting for precipitation and season. Three of 7 Legionella pneumonia patients engaged in reconstruction work and 2 Legionella pneumonia patients had soil exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of Legionella pneumonia after not only rainfall and serious flooding, but also following recovery work or soil exposure should be considered.","['Mitsui M', 'Ito A', 'Ishida T', 'Tachibana H', 'Nakanishi Y', 'Yamazaki A', 'Washio Y']",2021,27,10,J Infect Chemother,"Mitsui M, et al.

34085864,Improvements to the Success of Outbreak Investigations of Legionnaires' Disease: 40 Years of Testing and Investigation in New York State.,"Since 1978, the New York State Department of Health's public health laboratory, Wadsworth Center (WC), in collaboration with epidemiology and environmental partners, has been committed to providing comprehensive public health testing for Legionella in New York. Statewide, clinical case counts have been increasing over time, with the highest numbers identified in 2017 and 2018 (1,022 and 1,426, respectively). Over the course of more than 40 years, the WC Legionella testing program has continuously implemented improved testing methods. The methods utilized have transitioned from solely culture-based methods for organism recovery to development of a suite of reference testing services, including identification and characterization by PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). In the last decade, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has further refined the ability to link outbreak strains between clinical specimens and environmental samples. Here, we review Legionnaires' disease outbreak investigations during this time period, including comprehensive testing of both clinical and environmental samples. Between 1978 and 2017, 60 outbreaks involving clinical and environmental isolates with matching PFGE patterns were detected in 49 facilities from the 157 investigations at 146 facilities. However, 97 investigations were not solved due to the lack of clinical or environmental isolates or PFGE matches. We found 69% of patient specimens from New York State (NYS) were outbreak associated, a much higher rate than observed in other published reports. The consistent application of new cutting-edge technologies and environmental regulations has resulted in successful investigations resulting in remediation efforts.

34051632,All-trans-retinoic acid restores CD4+ T cell response after sepsis by inhibiting the expansion and activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.,"BACKGROUND: Patients are susceptible to immunosuppression in late-stage of sepsis, in which myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is an important contributor. This study aims to investigate whether all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which has been proved to inhibit MDSCs generation in cancer, will ameliorate sepsis-induced immuno-suppression through modulating MDSCs.
METHODS: A clinically relevant ""two-hit'' model of sepsis, the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model and secondary pneumonia model, were established in mice. The effects of ATRA on the mortality, the bacterial burden, the expansion and activity of CLP-induced MDSCs, as well as the function of CD4+ T cells were evaluated.
RESULTS: In CLP model, ATRA was found to reduce frequency of MDSCs in spleen of mice and inhibit activity of MDSCs by regulating the generation and activity of arginase-1 and iNOS, and the secretion of immune-supressive cytokines. ATRA administration eventually reduced mortality of secondary infection by Legionella pneumophila in CLP-surviving mice, which might be associated with the restoration of CD4+ T cells proliferating and secreting activity.
CONCLUSION: ATRA can restore CD4+ T cells dysfunction in sepsis by modulating the expansion and function of MDSCs and therefore provides a potential therapy that targets the immunosuppressive state of sepsis.","['Liu T', 'Yang F', 'Xie J', 'Chen J', 'Gao W', 'Bai X', 'Li Z']",2021,136,,Mol Immunol,"Liu T, et al.

These surface properties may differ depending on the growth phase of L. pneumophila resulting in variable adhesion and persistence within EWS. We describe the growth-dependent variations in L. pneumophila cell surface hydrophobicity and surface charge using the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon assay and microelectrophoresis, respectively, and their role in cell adhesion to stainless steel using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring instrument. We observed a steady increase in L. pneumophila hydrophobicity during their lifecycle in culture media. Cell surfaces of stationary phase L. pneumophila were significantly more hydrophobic than their lag and midexponential counterparts. No significant changes in L. pneumophila cell surface charge were noted. Morphology of L. pneumophila remained relatively constant throughout their lifecycle. In the QCM-D study, lag and exponential phase L. pneumophila weakly adhered to stainless steel surfaces resulting in viscoelastic layers. In contrast, stationary phase bacteria were tightly and irreversibly bound to the surfaces, forming rigid layers. Our results suggest that the stationary phase of L. pneumophila would highly favour their adhesion to plumbing surfaces and persistence in EWS.","['Ariyadasa S', 'Abeysekera G', 'Billington C', 'Fee C', 'Pang L']",2021,73,2,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Ariyadasa S, et al.

34019935,Comparative study of Legiolert with ISO 11731-1998 standard method-conclusions from a Public Health Laboratory.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is responsible for 96% of Legionnaires' disease (LD) and 10% of all worldwide pneumonia cases. Legiolert™, a liquid culture method for most probable number (MPN) enumeration of L. pneumophila, was developed by IDEXX Laboratories. The method detects all serogroups of L. pneumophila in potable and non-potable water samples.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to establish that Legiolert is a suitable alternative method to meet testing requirements in Spain for the enumeration of Legionella in water samples.
METHODOLOGY: The laboratory analyzed 118 environmental water samples from the Barcelona region (56 potable and 62 non-potable) in parallel by the Standard method for detection and enumeration of Legionella (ISO 11731:1998) and by Legiolert. Comparison of the recovery of the alternative method (Legiolert) and the Standard was made using ISO 17994:2014 and McNemar's binomial test statistical methods.
RESULTS: 44 samples were positive for Legionella (36 potable and 8 non-potable). Legiolert and the Standard method detected a similar percentage of positive samples, with Legiolert being slightly higher (31 vs 30%) and detecting higher concentrations of Legionella within the samples. ISO 17994:2014 analysis of the potable water samples found Legiolert was more sensitive than the Standard at detecting Legionella, even when complete Legionella species (L. spp.) results were considered for both methods. The two methods also demonstrated equivalent detection of L. spp. according to the McNemar's test. The comparison is significantly more in favor of Legiolert when only L. pneumophila results are considered. Each confirmation run with material extracted from positive Legiolert wells contained L. pneumophila, giving the method a specificity of 100%. Although statistical results for non-potable waters are not included because of the low number of samples, the two methods trended towards equivalence.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative to the Standard method, Legiolert has a greater sensitivity and selectivity, and appears to have higher recovery for L. pneumophila, and equivalent recovery when L. spp. is included in the comparison. Legiolert also has high specificity. The procedural advantages of Legiolert allow laboratories to save on resources, costs, and time and consequently to test more frequently. In conclusion, the study finds IDEXX Legiolert a suitable alternative to ISO 11731:1998.","['Checa J', 'Carbonell I', 'Manero N', 'Martí I']",2021,186,,J Microbiol Methods,"Checa J, et al.

33990625,Genome-wide insights into population structure and host specificity of Campylobacter jejuni.,"The zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is among the leading causes of foodborne diseases worldwide. While C. jejuni colonises many wild animals and livestock, persistence mechanisms enabling the bacterium to adapt to host species' guts are not fully understood. In order to identify putative determinants influencing host preferences of distinct lineages, bootstrapping based on stratified random sampling combined with a k-mer-based genome-wide association was conducted on 490 genomes from diverse origins in Germany and Canada. We show a strong association of both the core and the accessory genome characteristics with distinct host animal species, indicating multiple adaptive trajectories defining the evolution of C. jejuni lifestyle preferences in different ecosystems. Here, we demonstrate that adaptation towards a specific host niche ecology is most likely a long evolutionary and multifactorial process, expressed by gene absence or presence and allele variations of core genes. Several host-specific allelic variants from different phylogenetic backgrounds, including dnaE, rpoB, ftsX or pycB play important roles for genome maintenance and metabolic pathways. Thus, variants of genes important for C. jejuni to cope with specific ecological niches or hosts may be useful markers for both surveillance and future pathogen intervention strategies.","['Epping L', 'Walther B', 'Piro RM', 'Knüver MT', 'Huber C', 'Thürmer A', 'Flieger A', 'Fruth A', 'Janecko N', 'Wieler LH', 'Stingl K', 'Semmler T']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Epping L, et al.

Moreover, V. vermiformis are well known to host viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms and cases of keratitis due to V. vermiformis in conjunction with other amoebae have been reported. Despite the preceding, the medical importance of V. vermiformis is still an ongoing discussion and its genome has been only recently sequenced. Herein, we present a review of the current understanding of the biology and pathogenesis pertaining to V. vermiformis, as well as its' role as an etiological agent and trojan horse. An approach known as theranostics which combines both diagnosis and therapy could be utilized to eradicate and diagnose keratitis cases caused by such amoebae. Given the rise in global warming, it is imperative to investigate these rarely studied amoebae and to understand their importance in human health.","['Siddiqui R', 'Makhlouf Z', 'Khan NA']",2021,68,5,J Eukaryot Microbiol,"Siddiqui R, et al.

33980916,Revealing the activation mechanism of autoinhibited RalF by integrated simulation and experimental approaches.,"RalF is an Arf GEF from Legionella pneumophilia, the bacterium that causes severe pneumonia. In its crystal structure, RalF is in the autoinhibited form. A large-scale domain motion is expected to lift the autoinhibition, the mechanism of which is still unknown. Since RalF is activated in the presence of the membrane, its active structure and the structure of the RalF-Arf1 complex could not have been determined experimentally. On the simulation side, it has been proven that classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) alone is not efficient enough to map motions of such amplitude and determine the active conformation of RalF. In this article, using Molecular Dynamics with excited Normal Modes (MDeNM) combined with previous experimental findings we were able to determine the active RalF structure and the structure of the RalF-Arf1 complex in the presence of the membrane, bridging the gap between experiments and simulation.","['Dudas B', 'Perahia D', 'Balog E']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Dudas B, et al.

A plethora of microbial domains including viruses (other than SARS-CoV-2), bacteria, archaea and fungi have evolved together, and interact in complex molecular pathogenesis along with SARS-CoV-2. However, the involvement of other microbial co-pathogens and underlying molecular mechanisms leading to extortionate ailment in critically ill COVID-19 patients has yet not been extensively reviewed. Although, the incidence of co-infections could be up to 94.2% in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the fate of co-infections among SARS-CoV-2 infected hosts often depends on the balance between the host's protective immunity and immunopathology. Predominantly identified co-pathogens of SARS-CoV-2 are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila and Clamydia pneumoniae followed by viruses including influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The cross-talk between co-pathogens (especially lung microbiomes), SARS-CoV-2 and host is an important factor that ultimately increases the difficulty of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. Simultaneously, co-infecting microbiotas may use new strategies to escape host defense mechanisms by altering both innate and adaptive immune responses to further aggravate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Better understanding of co-infections in COVID-19 is critical for the effective patient management, treatment and containment of SARS-CoV-2. This review therefore necessitates the comprehensive investigation of commonly reported microbial co-pathogens amid COVID-19, their transmission pattern along with the possible mechanism of co-infections and outcomes. Thus, identifying the possible co-pathogens and their underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may shed light in developing diagnostics, appropriate curative and preventive interventions for suspected SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in the current pandemic.","['Hoque MN', 'Akter S', 'Mishu ID', 'Islam MR', 'Rahman MS', 'Akhter M', 'Islam I', 'Hasan MM', 'Rahaman MM', 'Sultana M', 'Islam T', 'Hossain MA']",2021,156,,Microb Pathog,"Hoque MN, et al.

In this work, proteases present in the culture supernatants of Legionella spp. were used as a biomarker. Fluorogenic peptide substrates, specific to Legionella strains culture supernatant proteases, were identified. Peptidases produced a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity following the cleavage of the dipeptide fluorogenic substrates. The specific substrates were identified and coupled with carboxyl-terminated nano-magnetic particles (NMPs). On the other hand, the C-terminal was conjugated with the cysteine residue to covalently integrate with a gold sensing platform via the Au-S linkage. Four different sensors were fabricated from the four specific substrates, which were treated with the protesase of six different species of Legionella. In the presence of specific protease, the peptide sequence is digested and the magnetic nanobeads moved out of the gold surface, resulting in the apparence of gold color.

We have developed a new point-of-care (POC) method for the fast and efficient detection of Legionella pneumophila in water. The method consists first of the generation of immunocomplexes of bacteria species with its corresponding targeted fluorescence-labelled serogroup-specific antibodies, and second a concentration step of pathogens with a membrane filter. Third, on the filtration membrane, our method can detect the fluorescence intensity corresponding to the pathogen concentration. Thus selective and efficient evidence for the presence of bacteria can be evaluated. We tested our system on fluorescent Escherichia coli bacteria and were able to reach an accurate determination of 1000 cells. The technique was furthermore tested on Legionella pneumophila cells, which were labelled with fluorescence-labelled antibodies as a proof of principle. Furthermore, we were able to verify this method in the presence of other bacteria species. We were able to detect bacteria cells within half an hour, a substantial advancement compared to the prevailling state of the art detection method based on the cultivation of Legionella pneumophila. Hence, this system represents the basis for future developments in analysis of pathogens.","['Schwaminger S', 'Rottmueller ME', 'Fischl R', 'Kalali B', 'Berensmeier S']",2021,146,11,Analyst,"Schwaminger S, et al.

33895597,Genetic diversity and pathogenic potential of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) derived from German flour.,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) can cause severe human illness, which are frequently linked to the consumption of contaminated beef or dairy products. However, recent outbreaks associated with contaminated flour and undercooked dough in the United States and Canada, highlight the potential of plant based food as transmission routes for STEC. In Germany STEC has been isolated from flour, but no cases of illness have been linked to flour. In this study, we characterized 123 STEC strains isolated from flour and flour products collected between 2015 and 2019 across Germany. In addition to determination of serotype and Shiga toxin subtype, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used for isolates collected in 2018 to determine phylogenetic relationships, sequence type (ST), and virulence-associated genes (VAGs). We found a high diversity of serotypes including those frequently associated with human illness and outbreaks, such as O157:H7 (stx2c/d, eae), O145:H28 (stx2a, eae), O146:H28 (stx2b), and O103:H2 (stx1a, eae). Serotypes O187:H28 (ST200, stx2g) and O154:H31 (ST1892, stx1d) were most prevalent, but are rarely linked to human cases. However, WGS analysis revealed that these strains, as well as, O156:H25 (ST300, stx1a) harbour high numbers of VAGs, including eae, nleB and est1a/sta1. Although STEC-contaminated flour products have yet not been epidemiologically linked to human clinical cases in Germany, this study revealed that flour can serve as a vector for STEC strains with a high pathogenic potential. Further investigation is needed to determine the sources of STEC contamination in flour and flour products particularly in regards to these rare serotypes.","['Projahn M', 'Lamparter MC', 'Ganas P', 'Goehler A', 'Lorenz-Wright SC', 'Maede D', 'Fruth A', 'Lang C', 'Schuh E']",2021,347,,Int J Food Microbiol,"Projahn M, et al.

33881638,"A robust phylogenetic framework for members of the order Legionellales and its main genera (Legionella, Aquicella, Coxiella and Rickettsiella) based on phylogenomic analyses and identification of molecular markers demarcating different clades.","The order Legionellales contains several clinically important microorganisms. Although members of this order are well-studied for their pathogenesis, there is a paucity of reliable characteristics distinguishing members of this order and its constituent genera. Genome sequences are now available for 73 Legionellales species encompassing ≈90% of known members from different genera. With the aim of understanding evolutionary relationships and identifying reliable molecular characteristics that are specific for this order and its constituent genera, detailed phylogenetic and comparative analyses were conducted on the protein sequences from these genomes. A phylogenomic tree was constructed based on 393 single copy proteins that are commonly shared by the members of this order to delineate the evolutionary relationships among its members. In parallel, comparative analyses were performed on protein sequences from Legionellales genomes to identify novel molecular markers consisting of conserved signature indels (CSIs) that are specific for different clades and genera. In the phylogenomic tree and in an amino acid identity matrix based on core proteins, members of the genera Aquicella, Coxiella, Legionella and Rickettsiella formed distinct clades confirming their monophyly. In these studies, Diplorickettsia massiliensis exhibited a close relationship to members of the genus Rickettsiella. The results of our comparative genomic analyses have identified 59 highly specific molecular markers consisting of CSIs in diverse proteins that are uniquely shared by different members of this order. Four of these CSIs are specific for all Legionellales species, except the two deeper-branching ""Candidatus Berkiella"" species, providing means for identifying members of this order in molecular terms. Twenty four, 7 and 6 CSIs are uniquely shared by members of the genera Legionella, Coxiella and Aquicella, respectively, identifying these groups in molecular terms. The descriptions of these three genera are emended to include information for their novel molecular characteristics. We also describe 12 CSIs that are uniquely shared by D. massiliensis and different members of the genus Rickettsiella. Based on these results, we are proposing an integration of the genus Diplorickettsia with Rickettsiella. Three other CSIs suggest that members of the genera Coxiella and Rickettsiella shared a common ancestor exclusive of other Legionellales. The described molecular markers, due to their exclusivity for the indicated taxa/genera, provide important means for the identification of these clinically important microorganisms and for discovering novel properties unique to them.","['Saini N', 'Gupta RS']",2021,114,7,Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek,"Saini N and Gupta RS.

33849818,Impact of Next-Generation Sequencing Cell-free Pathogen DNA Test on Antimicrobial Management in Adults with Hematological Malignancies and Transplant Recipients with Suspected Infections.,"Infections in adult patients with hematological malignancies (HM) and stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. A timely diagnosis of infections can have a major impact on outcomes. Tools that help rule out infectious causes of fever can decrease antibiotic use, toxicities, hospitalization costs, and potentially decrease antibiotic resistance in the long term. We retrospectively evaluated the ability of cell-free DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing in the timely identification of pathogenic microorganisms and its impact on the antimicrobial management of immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies. In the period between 2018 to 2020, 95 samples were reviewed, of which 31 adult patients (32 tests) had hematologic malignancies or were recipients of SCT. The NGS tests were performed in the following patients: (a) patients with prolonged fever and negative conventional tests, (b) persistent fever despite positive conventional test and appropriate antimicrobials, and (c) fever-free patients with imaging suspicious for infection. The median time from fever to NGS sampling was 5 days (range, 1-28). The median time to NGS results was 2 days (range, 1-6). The NGS resulted in an escalation of antibiotics in 28% of cases (9/32) and de-escalation of antibiotics in 31% of cases (10/32). Overall, NGS testing changed management in nearly 59% (19/32) of patients. The sensitivity and specificity of NGS to detect clinically significant infection was 80% and 58%, respectively. The test identified uncommon and difficult to diagnose organisms such as Nocardia, Legionella, Toxoplasma and Pneumocystis jirovecii resulting in rapid antimicrobial interventions. In conclusion, in patients with HM or SCT recipients, microbial cell-free DNA sequencing allowed rapid and actionable treatment. This strategy can target appropriate antibiotic use, avoid overtreatment, and potentially decrease the hospital length-of-stay.","['Yu J', 'Diaz JD', 'Goldstein SC', 'Patel RD', 'Varela JC', 'Reyenga C', 'Smith M', 'Smith T', 'Balls J', 'Ahmad S', 'Mori S']",2021,27,6,Transplant Cell Ther,"Yu J, et al.

33847421,Comparison of the culture method with multiplex PCR for the confirmation of Legionella spp. and Legionella pneumophila.,"AIMS: The detection and enumeration of Legionella spp. in water samples are typically performed via a cultural technique standardized in ISO 11731. This method is time-consuming (up to 15 days), and the specificity of the confirmation step is questionable. This study proposes the use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm presumptive Legionella colonies directly from the culture plate; this shortens the response time by 2-5 days while still reporting results in colony forming units (CFU).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Two laboratories analysed a total of 290 colonies to compare the confirmation step of Legionella spp. and Legionella pneumophila in accordance with ISO 11731 by culture growth and agglutination vs multiplex PCR. Discordant results were resolved by the swiss national reference laboratory. The data were evaluated following ISO 16140 and showed that the PCR-technique had higher specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: The confirmation of Legionella spp., L. pneumophila and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 by multiplex PCR allows detection of positive colonies more rapidly and with higher specificity.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study highlights a possibility to shorten the response time significantly during the enumeration of Legionella spp. and achieving a higher specificity while adhering to the legally recognized reporting in CFU.","['Eble D', 'Gehrig V', 'Schubert-Ullrich P', 'Köppel R', 'Füchslin HP']",2021,131,5,J Appl Microbiol,"Eble D, et al.

This study investigates the OSPW remediation potential of delayed petroleum-coke (PC), which is a byproduct of bitumen upgrading process and is readily available at oil refining sites, in fixed-bed biofilters particularly for the degradation of naphthenic acids (NAs) and aromatics. The biofilters were operated continuously and total and active bacterial communities were studied by DNA and RNA-based amplicon sequencing in a metataxonomic fashion to extrapolate the underlying degradation mechanisms. The results of total community structure indicated a high abundance of aerobic bacteria at all depths of the biofilter, e.g., Porphyrobacter, Legionella, Pseudomonas, Planctomyces.

Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia is commonly associated with dismal prognoses, with survival rates of about 3 months. In this paper, we report on a patient with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-small cell lung carcinoma who developed severe hypercalcemia and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this metabolic complication.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year old male with a 2-year history of Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with life-threatening hypercalcemia. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed a suspicious lung lesion. A transbronchial biopsy was performed from the upper left lobe. Due to the small size of the specimen, immunohistochemical markers were performed and revealed positive staining for cytokeratin 7 and negative for TTF-1, napsin A and p 40, which were consistent with non-small cell lung carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS: Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy was diagnosed.
INTERVENTION: The patient was treated with saline infusion, calcitonin, intravenous pamidronate, followed with denosumab.
OUTCOMES: The hypercalcemia was successfully treated and the patient's calcium levels returned to normal. Further evaluation revealed a non-small cell lung carcinoma as a second primary malignancy. The patient was treated with venetoclax for his refractory CLL and received chemotherapy and immunotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma. Several days after starting venetoclax, he developed Legionella pneumonia and short time after the second course of chemotherapy, a severe sepsis occurred and he passed away.
LESSONS: Coexistence of 2 unrelated malignancies, whichever could be a reason for hypercalcemia of malignancy is a rare event. Severe hypercalcemia, which is possible but rare feature of CLL should be a reason for further prompt evaluation.","['Shacham EC', 'Marshak DC', 'Brikman S', 'Dori G', 'Ishay A']",2021,100,14,Medicine (Baltimore),"Shacham EC, et al.

33815967,EVALI - E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury: A Case Report.,"The use of electronic cigarettes among the young adult and adolescent population has increased over the past decade. Vaping is the process of inhaling an aerosol that is produced by heating a liquid or wax containing substances, such as nicotine, cannabinoids (e.g., tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol), flavoring, and additives (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol) using an e-cigarette. A multistate epidemic associated with vaping prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue an official health advisory on e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific diagnostic test. We present a case of EVALI before the COVID-19 pandemic time in a 23-year-old immunocompetent male student with an eight-year history of vaping. He presented to the emergency department with fever, shortness of breath, tachypnea, nausea, and diarrhea. The patient had no past medical history. The patient denied illicit drug abuse or known drug allergies. The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis and pneumonia. The patient's urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids with a history of vaping. Community-acquired pneumonia due to Legionella, Pneumococcal, Mycoplasma bacteria was ruled out. Influenza A/B, Parainfluenza, Rhino, and Adenoviruses were negative. A computed tomographyscan of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates. He was treated with high dose steroids, empiric antibiotics, high flow oxygen and managed in ICU for seven days. The patient was discharged on tapering doses of steroid and counseled to quit vaping. EVALI outbreak is strongly linked to vitamin E acetate in vaping products. EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion with a history of vaping and responds well to steroids.","['Adhikari R', 'Koritala T', 'Gotur R', 'Malayala SV', 'Jain NK']",2021,13,2,Cureus,"Adhikari R, et al.

33774901,Coxiella burnetii encodes an LvgA-related protein important for intracellular replication.,"Coxiella burnetii is a bacterial pathogen that replicates in a specialised lysosome-derived organelle called the Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV). Establishment of the CCV requires the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system. A previous transposon mutagenesis screen identified the gene cbu1754 as being important for the intracellular replication of C. burnetii. To understand the function of the protein encoded by cbu1754, CCV maturation and intracellular replication phenotypes of a cbu1754 mutant were analysed. In contrast to vacuoles containing wild-type C. burnetii Nine Mile phase II, vacuoles containing the isogenic cbu1754 mutant were smaller and did not display detectible amounts of the autophagy protein LC3, which indicated a CCV biogenesis defect. The Cbu1754 protein was not efficiently delivered into the host cell cytosol during infection, which indicated this protein is not a Dot/Icm-translocated effector protein. Secondary structure predictions suggested that Cbu1754 could be similar to the Legionella pneumophila LvgA protein, which is a component of the Dot/Icm apparatus. Consistent with this hypothesis, production of Cbu1754 in an L. pneumophila ∆lvgA mutant restored LvgA-dependent activities. The L. pneumophila proteins LvgA, IcmS and IcmW are interacting partners that comprise a subassembly of the coupling protein complex that mediates Dot/Icm-dependent effector translocation. Similarly, the Cbu1754 protein was found to be a component of the chaperone complex containing the C. burnetii proteins IcmS and IcmW. Thus, the Cbu1754 protein is an LvgA-related protein important for Dot/Icm function and intracellular replication of C. burnetii.","['Steiner S', 'Meir A', 'Roy CR']",2021,23,6,Cell Microbiol,"Steiner S, et al.

33774629,Mucosal Respiratory Syndrome: A Systematic Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae atypical pneumonia is frequently associated with erythema multiforme. Occasionally, a mycoplasma infection does not trigger any cutaneous but exclusively mucosal lesions. The term mucosal respiratory syndrome is employed to denote the latter condition. Available reviews do not address the possible association of mucosal respiratory syndrome with further atypical bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, or Legionella species. We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature addressing this issue in the National Library of Medicine, Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases.
SUMMARY: We found 63 patients (≤18 years, n = 36; >18 years, n = 27; 54 males and 9 females) affected by a mucosal respiratory syndrome. Fifty-three cases were temporally associated with a M. pneumoniae and 5 with a C. pneumoniae infection. No cases temporally associated with C. psittaci, C. burnetii, F. tularensis, or Legionella species infection were found. Two cases were temporally associated with Epstein-Barr virus or influenzavirus B, respectively.","['De Luigi G', 'Meoli M', 'Zgraggen L', 'Kottanattu L', 'Simonetti GD', 'Terrani I', 'Bianchetti MG', 'Lava SAG', 'Milani GP']",2022,238,1,Dermatology,"De Luigi G, et al.

33760868,Legionella hijacks the host Golgi-to-ER retrograde pathway for the association of Legionella-containing vacuole with the ER.,"Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is a gram-negative bacterium that replicates in a compartment that resembles the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To create its replicative niche, L. pneumophila manipulates host membrane traffic and fusion machineries. Bacterial proteins called Legionella effectors are translocated into the host cytosol and play a crucial role in these processes. In an early stage of infection, Legionella subverts ER-derived vesicles (ERDVs) by manipulating GTPase Rab1 to facilitate remodeling of the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). Subsequently, the LCV associates with the ER in a mechanism that remains elusive. In this study, we show that L. pneumophila recruits GTPases Rab33B and Rab6A, which regulate vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the ER, to the LCV to promote the association of LCV with the ER. We found that recruitment of Rab6A to the LCV depends on Rab33B. Legionella effector SidE family proteins, which phosphoribosyl-ubiquitinate Rab33B, were found to be necessary for the recruitment of Rab33B to the LCV. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that L. pneumophila facilitates the interaction of Rab6 with ER-resident SNAREs comprising syntaxin 18, p31, and BNIP1, but not tethering factors including NAG, RINT-1, and ZW10, which are normally required for syntaxin 18-mediated fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles with the ER. Our results identified a Rab33B-Rab6A cascade on the LCV and the interaction of Rab6 with ER-resident SNARE proteins for the association of LCV with the ER and disclosed the unidentified physiological role of SidE family proteins.","['Kawabata M', 'Matsuo H', 'Koito T', 'Murata M', 'Kubori T', 'Nagai H', 'Tagaya M', 'Arasaki K']",2021,17,3,PLoS Pathog,"Kawabata M, et al.

33758992,Evaluation of Legiolert™ for the Detection of Legionella pneumophila and Comparison with Spread-Plate Culture and qPCR Methods.,"Legionella pneumophila, the organism responsible for Legionnaires' disease, a potentially lethal pneumonia, is an opportunistic bacterium spread via inhalation of contaminated, aerosolized water. The detection and control of L. pneumophila is crucial to reduce the risk it poses to human health. L. pneumophila is generally detected and quantified by the plating method, ISO 11731:2017 and by qPCR. ISO 11731 is based on the filtration of the water sample through a membrane, which is placed on selective agar medium, and after colony growth, presumptive Legionella are then confirmed by subculturing, serology, or PCR. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) is based on the amplification of a DNA sequence specific to L. pneumophila, usually within the mip gene. The objective of this study was to compare these methods to a new, liquid culture method based on the Most Probable Number (MPN) technique, Legiolert™/Quanti-Tray® with data obtained with ISO 11731 and a viability quantitative qPCR (v-qPCR), for quantification of L. pneumophila in potable and non-potable waters. Data showed that the Legiolert method revealed concentrations of L. pneumophila greater than ISO 11731 and generally similar results to those of v-qPCR. The Legiolert method was highly specific and easy to use, representing a significant advancement in the quantification of L. pneumophila from potable and non-potable waters.","['Monteiro SN', 'Robalo AM', 'Santos RJ']",2021,78,5,Curr Microbiol,"Monteiro SN, et al.

However, intracellular pathogenic endosymbiosis and its implications within Acanthamoeba spp. remain poorly understood. In this study, RNA sequencing analysis was used to investigate transcriptional changes in A. castellanii in response to L. pneumophila infection. Based on RNA sequencing data, we identified 1,211 upregulated genes and 1,131 downregulated genes in A. castellanii infected with L. pneumophila for 12 hr. After 24 hr, 1,321 upregulated genes and 1,379 downregulated genes were identified. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that L. pneumophila endosymbiosis enhanced hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and DNA binding while reducing oxidoreductase activity in the molecular function (MF) domain. In particular, multiple genes associated with the GO term 'integral component of membrane' were downregulated during endosymbiosis. The endosymbiont also induced differential expression of various methyltransferases and acetyltransferases in A. castellanii.

33660322,Structural and functional study of Legionella pneumophila effector RavA.,"Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen that causes Legionnaire's disease in humans. This bacterium can be found in freshwater environments as a free-living organism, but it is also an intracellular parasite of protozoa. Human infection occurs when inhaled aerosolized pathogen comes into contact with the alveolar mucosa and replicates in alveolar macrophages. Legionella enters the host cell by phagocytosis and redirects the Legionella-containing phagosomes from the phagocytic maturation pathway. These nascent phagosomes fuse with ER-derived secretory vesicles and membranes forming the Legionella-containing vacuole. Legionella subverts many host cellular processes by secreting over 300 effector proteins into the host cell via the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. The cellular function for many Dot/Icm effectors is still unknown. Here, we present a structural and functional study of L. pneumophila effector RavA (Lpg0008). Structural analysis revealed that the RavA consists of four ~85 residue long α-helical domains with similar folds, which show only a low level of structural similarity to other protein domains. The ~90 residues long C-terminal segment is predicted to be natively unfolded. We show that during L. pneumophila infection of human cells, RavA localizes to the Golgi apparatus and to the plasma membrane. The same localization is observed when RavA is expressed in human cells. The localization signal resides within the C-terminal sequence C","['Chung IYW', 'Li L', 'Tyurin O', 'Gagarinova A', 'Wibawa R', 'Li P', 'Hartland EL', 'Cygler M']",2021,30,5,Protein Sci,"Chung IYW, et al.

33652278,Destruction of microbial stability in drinking water distribution systems by trace phosphorus polluted water source.,"The effects of trace phosphate concentrations (0, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/L) in water source were investigated on microbial stability of the drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs). Obviously, the results verified that in the effluent of DWDSs simulated by annular reactors (ARs), the total microbial biomass and the absolute concentration of opportunistic pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium, and Hartmanella vermiformis increased significantly with phosphate concentration increasing. Based on X-ray powder diffractometer and zeta potentials measurement, trace phosphate did change physicochemical properties of corrosion products, hence promoting microbes escape from corrosion products to bulk water to a certain extent. Stimulated by chlorine disinfectant and phosphate, the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the suspended biofilms of AR-0.6 gradually exhibited superior characteristics including higher content, flocculating efficiency, hydrophobicity and tightness degree, contributing to formation of large-scale suspended biofilms with strong chlorine-resistance ability. However, the disinfection by-products concentration in DWDSs barely changed due to the balance of EPS precursors contribution and biodegradation effect, covering up the microbiological water quality risk. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the trace phosphorus polluted water source though its concentration was much lower than wastewater. This is the first study successfully revealing the influence mechanism of trace phosphate on microbial stability in DWDSs, which may help to fully understand the biofilms transformation and microbial community succession in DWDSs.","['Xing X', 'Li T', 'Bi Z', 'Qi P', 'Li Z', 'Chen Y', 'Zhou H', 'Wang H', 'Xu G', 'Chen C', 'Ma K', 'Hu C']",2021,275,,Chemosphere,"Xing X, et al.

New regulations and standards have prioritized the development of water safety plans to minimize the growth and spread of Legionella species in buildings. To determine the presence and type of Legionella in a water system, microbiological culturing is the gold standard method. However, recently new methodologies have been developed that claim to be sensitive and specific for Legionella at the genus or L. pneumophila at the species level. Published and anecdotal reports suggest that one of these newer culture-based, enzyme-substrate methods, the IDEXX Legiolert test, may exhibit false positivity with other microbes common to water sources. We experimentally evaluated the IDEXX Legiolert method using these other waterborne bacteria including Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens at real-world environmental concentrations. We saw false-positive results for the Legiolert test with several of these organisms, at sample concentrations as low as 60 CFU per ml.

33640751,Influence of pipe materials on the microbial community in unchlorinated drinking water and biofilm.,"Biodegradable compounds can cause undesired microbial growth in drinking water systems and these compounds can originate from the water or pipe materials used in drinking water systems. The aim of our study was to determine the influence of different pipe materials on the microbial populations in water and biofilm under semi-stagnant conditions. The microbial communities in biofilm and water, which were in contact with seven different materials, were characterized by determining ATP concentrations, microbial composition gene copy numbers of some specific microbial groups. The ATP concentration in water and biofilm varied between the different materials with glass (negative control) < copper < PVCC < PE-Xc < PE-Xb < PE-100 < PVC-P. Gene copy numbers of Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., fungi and Vermamoeba vermiformis were also higher for PVC-P and PE than for glass, copper and PVCC. The bacterial community composition in water and biofilm varied between materials as well. PERMANOVA and CAP analysis demonstrated that copper and PVC-P are different when compared to the other materials. Furthermore, bacterial community composition and ATP concentrations in water and biofilm were similar after eight and 16 weeks incubation, but differed from results obtained after one week. Finally, the ATP, the specific microbial groups and the bacterial community composition also differed between water and biofilm on each material. We conclude from our study that pipe material is an important factor that influences the biomass concentration, abundance of specific microorganisms and the bacterial community composition in distribution systems with unchlorinated drinking water.","['Learbuch KLG', 'Smidt H', 'van der Wielen PWJJ']",2021,194,,Water Res,"Learbuch KLG, et al.

33639022,A new symbiotic lineage related to Neisseria and Snodgrassella arises from the dynamic and diverse microbiomes in sucking lice.,"The phylogenetic diversity of symbiotic bacteria in sucking lice suggests that lice have a complex history of symbiont acquisition, loss, and replacement throughout their evolution. These processes have resulted in the establishment of different, phylogenetically distant bacteria as obligate mutualists in different louse groups. By combining metagenomics and amplicon screening across several populations of three louse species (members of the genera Polyplax and Hoplopleura) we describe a novel louse symbiont lineage related to Neisseria and Snodgrassella, and show its independent origin in the two louse genera. While the genomes of these symbionts are highly similar, their respective distributions and status within lice microbiomes indicate that they have different functions and history. In Hoplopleura acanthopus, the Neisseriaceae-related bacterium is a dominant obligate symbiont present across several host populations. In contrast, the Polyplax microbiomes are dominated by the obligate symbiont Legionella polyplacis, with the Neisseriaceae-related bacterium co-occurring only in some samples and with much lower abundance. The results thus support the view that compared to other exclusively blood feeding insects, Anoplura possess a unique capacity to acquire symbionts from diverse groups of bacteria.","['Říhová J', 'Batani G', 'Rodríguez-Ruano SM', 'Martinů J', 'Vácha F', 'Nováková E', 'Hypša V']",2021,30,9,Mol Ecol,"Říhová J, et al.

It is achieved by complex effector injection devices, the secretion systems, among which Type 4 Secretion Systems (T4SSs) play a key role in bacterial virulence of numerous animal and plant pathogens. Considerable progress has recently been made in the structure-function analyses of T4SSs. Nevertheless, the signals and processes that trigger machine assembly and activity during infection, as well as those involved in substrate recognition and transfer, are complex and still poorly understood.

33631307,Hospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia outbreak at an academic medical center: Lessons learned.,"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Legionella pneumonia occurred at a university hospital using copper-silver ionization for potable water disinfection. We present the epidemiological and laboratory investigation of the outbreak, and associated case-control study.
METHODS: Cases were defined by syndrome compatible with Legionella pneumonia with laboratory-confirmed Legionella infection. The water circuit and disinfection system were assessed, and water samples collected for Legionella culture. Whole genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST) was used to compare the genetic similarity of patient and environmental isolates. A case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors for Legionella pneumonia.
RESULTS: We identified 13 cases of hospital-acquired Legionella. wgMLST revealed >99.9% shared allele content among strains isolated from clinical and water samples. Smoking (P= .008), steroid use (P= .007), and documented shower during hospitalization (P= .03) were risk factors for Legionella pneumonia on multivariable analysis. Environmental assessment identified modifications to the hospital water system had occurred in the month preceding the outbreak. Multiple mitigation efforts and application of point of use water filters stopped the outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: Potable water system Legionella colonization occurs despite existing copper-silver ionization systems, particularly after structural disruptions. Multidisciplinary collaboration and direct monitoring for Legionella are important for outbreak prevention. Showering is a modifiable risk factor for nosocomial Legionella pneumonia. Shower restriction and point-of-use filters merit consideration during an outbreak.","['Kessler MA', 'Osman F', 'Marx J', 'Pop-Vicas A', 'Safdar N']",2021,49,8,Am J Infect Control,"Kessler MA, et al.

33599258,Legionella spp. All Ears? The Broad Occurrence of Quorum Sensing Elements outside Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella spp. are ubiquitous bacteria principally found in water networks and ∼20 species are implicated in Legionnaire's disease. Among them, Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen of environmental protozoa, responsible for ∼90% of cases in the world. Legionella pneumophila regulates in part its virulence by a quorum sensing system named ""Legionella quorum sensing,"" composed of a signal synthase LqsA, two histidine kinase membrane receptors LqsS and LqsT and a cytoplasmic receptor LqsR. To date, this communication system was only found in L. pneumophila. Here, we investigated 58 Legionella genomes to determine the presence of a lqs cluster or homologous receptors using TBlastN. This analysis revealed three categories of species: 19 harbored a complete lqs cluster, 20 did not possess lqsA but maintained the receptor lqsR and/or lqsS, and 19 did not have any of the lqs genes. No correlation was observed between pathogenicity and the presence of a quorum sensing system. We determined by RT-qPCR that the lqsA gene was expressed at least in four strains among different species available in our laboratory. Furthermore, we showed that the lqs genomic region was conserved even in species possessing only the receptors of the quorum sensing system, indicating an ancestral acquisition and various loss dynamics during evolution. This system could therefore function in interspecific communication as well.","['Herran B', 'Grève P', 'Berjeaud JM', 'Bertaux J', 'Crépin A']",2021,13,3,Genome Biol Evol,"Herran B, et al.

We compared the efficacy of the selective BCYEα +AB medium with that of the highly selective MWY medium.
RESULTS: Legionella spp. was detected in 48.2 and 47.1% of the samples by BCYEα +AB and MWY agar, respectively. For optimal detection of Legionella spp., most protocols recommend using selective media to reduce the number of non-Legionella bacteria. Agreement between the two media was 86.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, both media have a very similar performance and they both have advantages and disadvantages over each other. In AB medium there is the risk of being less selective so more interfering microbiota may grow but in MWY medium there is the risk of being too selective. The low selectivity of the AB medium could be resolved if other treatments are applied after filtration, e.g. acid and/or heat treatment, but it must be taken into account that these treatments still reduce the number of viable Legionella. In conclusion, we recommend using MWY as a selective medium for the detection of Legionella spp. as it is easier discern suspected colonies and facilitate the final Legionella spp.","['Ditommaso S', 'Giacomuzzi M', 'Memoli G', 'Garlasco J', 'Zotti CM']",2021,21,1,BMC Microbiol,"Ditommaso S, et al.

In this study, we generated a D. discoideum mutant strain lacking the sey1 gene and found that amoebae deleted for sey1 are enlarged, but grow and develop similarly to the parental strain. The ∆sey1 mutant amoebae showed an altered ER architecture, and the tubular ER network was partially disrupted without any major consequences for other organelles or the architecture of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Macropinocytic and phagocytic functions were preserved; however, the mutant amoebae exhibited cumulative defects in lysosomal enzymes exocytosis, intracellular proteolysis, and cell motility, resulting in impaired growth on bacterial lawns. Moreover, ∆sey1 mutant cells showed a constitutive activation of the unfolded protein response pathway (UPR), but they still readily adapted to moderate levels of ER stress, while unable to cope with prolonged stress. In D. discoideum ∆sey1 the formation of the ER-associated compartment harbouring the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila was also impaired. In the mutant amoebae, the ER was less efficiently recruited to the ""Legionella-containing vacuole"" (LCV), the expansion of the pathogen vacuole was inhibited at early stages of infection and intracellular bacterial growth was reduced.

33548724,Evaluation of microbial diversity of three recreational water bodies using 16S rRNA metagenomic approach.,"Surface water plays a significant role in world development by promoting economic growth and health benefits to humans and animals whose lives depend on good water quality in the ecosystem. Thus, this study investigated the differences in physical and chemical properties of surface water from two lakes (Lakes Jackson and Talquin) and a pond (Pedrick Pond). Also, the influence of environmental factors on the microbial communities that live within the water environment was examined. Genomic DNA was extracted from the water samples collected and 16S rRNA sequencing method was employed to characterize the microbial community compositions across the three locations. The results obtained suggest that the water sources met the recommended recreational water quality criteria standard for clean water. Overall, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes were the main bacterial phyla present in the communities, while Archaea was mainly dominated by Euryachaeota. Pressure, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH accounted for 74.2% of the variation in the distribution of the microbial community in the three locations (P < 0.05), while 58.2% of the variation in the microbial community distribution was accounted for by pressure and conductivity.

33542442,A multiplex CRISPR interference tool for virulence gene interrogation in Legionella pneumophila.,"Catalytically inactive dCas9 imposes transcriptional gene repression by sterically precluding RNA polymerase activity at a given gene to which it was directed by CRISPR (cr)RNAs. This gene silencing technology, known as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), has been employed in various bacterial species to interrogate genes, mostly individually or in pairs. Here, we developed a multiplex CRISPRi platform in the pathogen Legionella pneumophila capable of silencing up to ten genes simultaneously. Constraints on precursor-crRNA expression were overcome by combining a strong promoter with a boxA element upstream of a CRISPR array. Using crRNAs directed against virulence protein-encoding genes, we demonstrated that CRISPRi is fully functional not only during growth in axenic media, but also during macrophage infection, and that gene depletion by CRISPRi recapitulated the growth defect of deletion strains. By altering the position of crRNA-encoding spacers within the CRISPR array, our platform achieved the gradual depletion of targets that was mirrored by the severity in phenotypes. Multiplex CRISPRi thus holds great promise for probing large sets of genes in bulk in order to decipher virulence strategies of L. pneumophila and other bacterial pathogens.","['Ellis NA', 'Kim B', 'Tung J', 'Machner MP']",2021,4,1,Commun Biol,"Ellis NA, et al.

33503026,One is not enough: On the effects of reference genome for the mapping and subsequent analyses of short-reads.,"Mapping of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads to a single arbitrary reference genome is a frequently used approach in microbial genomics. However, the choice of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens). Publicly available whole-genome assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination rates, dN/dS ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses, particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions is highly recommended.","['Valiente-Mullor C', 'Beamud B', 'Ansari I', 'Francés-Cuesta C', 'García-González N', 'Mejía L', 'Ruiz-Hueso P', 'González-Candelas F']",2021,17,1,PLoS Comput Biol,"Valiente-Mullor C, et al.

For public health interventions, a diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity is required. The gold standard protocol for diagnosis by the Word Health Organization (WHO) is RT-PCR. To detect low viral loads and perform large-scale screening, a low-cost diagnostic test is necessary. Here, we developed a cost-effective test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2. We validated an auxiliary protocol for molecular diagnosis with the SYBR Green RT-PCR methodology to successfully screen negative cases of SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed a set of primers with high specificity and no homology with other viruses from the Coronovideae family or human respiratory tract pathogenic viruses, presenting with complementarity only for rhinoviruses/enteroviruses and Legionella spp. Optimization of the annealing temperature and polymerization time led to a high specificity in the PCR products. We have developed a more affordable and swift methodology for negative SARS-CoV-2 screening. This methodology can be applied on a large scale to soften panic and economic burden through guidance for isolation strategies.","['Marinowic DR', 'Zanirati G', 'Rodrigues FVF', 'Grahl MVC', 'Alcará AM', 'Machado DC', 'Da Costa JC']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Marinowic DR, et al.

In immunocompromised patients LD can cause necrosis of the lung parenchyma with abscess formation and cavitation. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with features of both primary and secondary immunodeficiency. SLE patients often develop pulmonary abnormalities, but rarely develop lung cavitations. We report a case of cavitary pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila in a 64-year-old female patient with SLE. We also highlight reasons why SLE patients are more prone to L. pneumophila infections. The importance of using correct diagnostic methods for recognizing and treating such infections is also discussed, as mistreatment of cavitary lesions in SLE patients with steroid therapy can have fatal outcomes as the infectious process can significantly worsen.","['Khokher W', 'Kesireddy N', 'Adunse J', 'Mudiyanselage PH', 'Iftikhar S', 'Assaly R']",2021,30,6,Lupus,"Khokher W, et al.

Here we demonstrate that the effector MavQ is a phosphoinositide 3-kinase that specifically catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) into PtdIns3P. The product of MavQ is subsequently phosphorylated by the effector LepB to yield PtdIns(3,4)P2, whose 3-phosphate is then removed by another effector SidF to generate PtdIns4P. We also show that MavQ is associated with the LCV and the ∆mavQ mutant displays phenotypes in the anchoring of a PtdIns4P-binding effector similar to those of ∆lepB or ∆sidF mutants. Our results establish a mechanism of de novo PtdIns4P biosynthesis by L. pneumophila via a catalysis axis comprised of MavQ, LepB, and SidF on the surface of its phagosome.","['Li G', 'Liu H', 'Luo ZQ', 'Qiu J']",2021,22,3,EMBO Rep,"Li G, et al.

Here we demonstrate that ProA promotes infection of human lung tissue explants (HLTEs) and dissect the contribution to cell type specific replication and extracellular virulence mechanisms. For the first time, we reveal that co-incubation of HLTEs with purified ProA causes a significant increase of the alveolar septal thickness. This destruction of connective tissue fibres was further substantiated by collagen IV degradation assays. The moderate attenuation of a proA-negative mutant in A549 epithelial cells and THP-1 macrophages suggests that effects of ProA in tissue mainly result from extracellular activity. Correspondingly, ProA contributes to dissemination and serum resistance of the pathogen, which further expands the versatile substrate spectrum of this thermolysin-like protease.

33484265,Confirming the Presence of Legionella pneumophila in Your Water System: A Review of Current Legionella Testing Methods.,"Legionnaires' disease has been recognized since 1976 and Legionella pneumophila still accounts for more than 95% of cases. Approaches in countries, including France, suggest that focusing risk reduction specifically on L. pneumophila is an effective strategy, as detecting L. pneumophila has advantages over targeting multiple species of Legionella. In terms of assays, the historically accepted plate culture method takes 10 days for confirmed Legionella spp. results, has variabilities which affect trending and comparisons, requires highly trained personnel to identify colonies on a plate in specialist laboratories, and does not recover viable-but-non-culturable bacteria. PCR is sensitive, specific, provides results in less than 24 h, and determines the presence/absence of Legionella spp. and/or L. pneumophila DNA. Whilst specialist personnel and laboratories are generally required, there are now on-site PCR options, but there is no agreement on comparing genome units to colony forming units and action limits. Immunomagnetic separation assays are culture-independent, detect multiple Legionella species, and results are available in 24 h, with automated processing options. Field-use lateral flow devices provide presence/absence determination of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 where sufficient cells are present, but testing potable waters is problematic. Liquid culture most probable number (MPN) assays provide confirmed L. pneumophila results in 7 days that are equivalent to or exceed plate culture, are robust and reproducible, and can be performed in a variety of laboratory settings. MPN isolates can be obtained for epidemiological investigations. This accessible, non-technical review will be of particular interest to building owners, operators, risk managers, and water safety groups and will enable them to make informed decisions to reduce the risk of L. pneumophila.","['Walker JT', 'McDermott PJ']",2021,104,4,J AOAC Int,Walker JT and McDermott PJ.

33479467,The impact of pipeline changes and temperature increase in a hospital historically colonised with Legionella.,"Healthcare-related Legionnaires' disease has a devastating impact on high risk patients, with a case fatality rate of 30-50%. Legionella prevention and control in hospitals is therefore crucial. To control Legionella water colonisation in a hospital setting we evaluated the effect of pipeline improvements and temperature increase, analysing 237 samples over a 2-year period (first year: 129, second year: 108). In the first year, 25.58% of samples were positive for Legionella and 16.67% for amoeba. Assessing the distance of the points analysed from the hot water tank, the most distal points presented higher proportion of Legionella colonisation and lower temperatures (nearest points: 6.4% colonised, and temperature 61.4 °C; most distal points: 50% and temperature 59.1 °C). After the first year, the hot water system was repaired and the temperature stabilised. This led to a dramatic reduction in Legionella colonisation, which was negative in all the samples analysed; however, amoeba colonisation remained stable. This study shows the importance of keeping the temperature stable throughout the circuit, at around 60 °C. Special attention should be paid to the most distal points of the circuit; a fall in temperature at these weak points would favour the colonisation and spread of Legionella, because amoeba (the main Legionella reservoir) are not affected by temperature.","['Quero S', 'Párraga-Niño N', 'Garcia-Núñez M', 'Pedro-Botet ML', 'Gavaldà L', 'Mateu L', 'Sabrià M', 'Mòdol JM']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Quero S, et al.

Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of a severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaire's disease, has acquired over 330 translocated effectors that showcase remarkable biochemical and structural diversity. However, the ART effectors that influence L. pneumophila have not been well defined. Here, we took a bioinformatic approach to search the Legionella effector repertoire for additional divergent members of the ART superfamily and identified an ART domain in Legionella pneumophila gene0181, which we hereafter refer to as Legionella ADP-Ribosyltransferase 1 (Lart1) (Legionella ART 1). We show that L. pneumophila Lart1 targets a specific class of 120-kDa NAD+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzymes found in fungi and protists, including many natural hosts of Legionella. Lart1 targets a conserved arginine residue in the NAD+-binding pocket of GDH, thereby blocking oxidative deamination of glutamate. Therefore, Lart1 could be the first example of a Legionella effector which directly targets a host metabolic enzyme during infection.","['Black MH', 'Osinski A', 'Park GJ', 'Gradowski M', 'Servage KA', 'Pawłowski K', 'Tagliabracci VS']",2021,296,,J Biol Chem,"Black MH, et al.

Its treatment is problematic at times because of diversity of infecting organisms and change in susceptibility pattern to commonly prescribed antimicrobials.
METHODS: This was a single centred prospective cross sectional study. About 165 patients diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia were included and blood samples, sputum samples were taken for culture sensitivity and antimicrobial susceptibility.
RESULTS: Of the 165 patients (43% males and 57% females), 77 (46.6%) patients tested positive for bacterial pathogens out of a total of 165. The most common pathogen was Streptococcus pneumonia (34%) followed on by Hemophilus influenza (16%), Staphylococcus aureus (13%) Klebsiella (12%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Legionella (6%), Eschericha coli (5%) and Proteus mirabilis (2%). The sensitivity pattern of all 77 bacterial isolates was high for cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, 81%; ceftazidime, 80%), penicillins (amoxicillin/sulbactam, 70%), quinolones (levofloxacin, 74%) and aminoglycosides (amikacin, 80.5%). The sensitivity to macrolides (azithromycin, 59.7%; clarithromycin, 53.2%) and tetracycline's (55.8%) is somewhat intermediate and low for ampicillin (42.8%) and cotrimoxazole (51.9%).

33428684,Health after Legionnaires' disease: A description of hospitalizations up to 5 years after Legionella pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Research on Legionnaires' Disease (LD) suggests there may be long-term health complications, but data are limited. This study investigated whether Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission during LD hospitalization may be associated with adverse health outcomes and characterized subsequent discharge diagnoses in patients with LD up to 5 years post-LD.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series study with follow up for 5 years among patients hospitalized at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center between 2005 and 2010 with LD. Data were collected from medical records on health history, LD severity (including ICU admission), and discharge diagnoses for 5 years post-LD or until death. We used ordinal logistic regression to explore associations between ICU admission and hospitalizations post-LD. Frequency counts were used to determine the most prevalent discharge diagnoses in the 5 years post-LD.
RESULTS: For the 292 patients with laboratory-confirmed LD, those admitted to the ICU during LD hospitalization were more likely to have a greater number of hospitalizations within 5 years compared to non-ICU patients (ORHosp 1.92 CI95% 1.25, 2.95). Fifty-five percent (161/292) had ≥ 1 hospitalization within 5 years post-LD. After accounting for pre-existing diagnosis codes in patients with at least one hospitalization in the 2 years prior to LD (n = 77/161 patients, 47.8%), three of the four most frequent new diagnoses in the 5 years post-LD were non-chronic conditions: acute renal failure (n = 22, 28.6%), acute respiratory failure (n = 17, 22.1%) and unspecified pneumonia (n = 15, 19.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that LD requiring ICU admission is associated with more subsequent hospitalizations, a factor that could contribute to poorer future health for people with severe LD. In addition to chronic conditions prevalent in this study population, we found new diagnoses in the 5-year post-LD period including acute renal failure. With LD incidence increasing, more research is needed to understand conditions and factors that influence long term health after LD.","['Gamage SD', 'Ross N', 'Kralovic SM', 'Simbartl LA', 'Roselle GA', 'Berkelman RL', 'Chamberlain AT']",2021,16,1,PLoS One,"Gamage SD, et al.

33427223,Biofilms in Dental Unit Water Lines.,"Biofilm formation has become a significant problem in dental unit water lines (DUWLs). The formation of biofilms and microbial growth in DUWLs leads to an unacceptably high number of microorganisms in the water used for spraying, cooling, and ultrasonication procedures. These procedures form aerosols which can be inhaled by the patients, and consequently dentistry constitutes an area of specific concern for patient safety. In particular, older and immunocompromised patients are at risk of serious respiratory tract infections if the water contains pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Pseudomonas spp. In the EU it is recommended that the water in DUWLs should not exceed 200 colony-forming units (CFU) of heterotrophic bacteria (bacteria living on organic material) per milliliter of water to be acceptable in dental work. A number of efficient products are available on the market that can be applied onto dental units. New dental units are nowadays equipped with ""inbuilt"" systems. Such measures have resulted in an acceptable standard of water in 95% of the 1,200 dental units in the Public Dental Health Service of the Västra Götalands region of Sweden that were followed yearly for 4 years. For the majority of the remaining DUWLs with an unacceptable standard this is due to neglect or inappropriate routines for water-cleaning procedures. It is the ability to follow instructions rather than the cleaning procedure itself that is decisive if clinics and dental units are to have an appropriate standard of water in their systems.",['Dahlen G'],2021,29,,Monogr Oral Sci,Dahlen G.

33421260,Recommendations on off-label use of intravenous azithromycin in children.,"OBJECTIVE: Intravenous azithromycin (AZM) has been widely used in children worldwide, but there still remains much concern regarding its off-label use, which urgently needs to be regulated. Therefore, we developed a rapid advice guideline in China to give recommendations of rational use of intravenous AZM in children.
METHODS: This guideline focuses on antimicrobial therapy with intravenous AZM in children. The Delphi research method was used to select questions. A systematic literature review was also conducted. Data were pooled and ranked according to the GRADE system. Recommendations were developed based on expert clinical experience, patients' values and preferences, and evidence availability. After an external review, the recommendations were revised and approved.
RESULTS: This guideline included eighteen recommendations that covered four domains: (a) Indications: the treatment of pneumonia caused by atypical but common pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, more typical bacteria as well as the treatment of bronchitis of presumed bacterial aetiologies; (b) Usage and dosage: administration route, infusion concentrations, treatment duration, course of sequential treatment, and dosage stratified by age; (c) Adverse reactions and treatment: the management of gastrointestinal reactions, arrhythmias, pain or phlebitis at the infusion site, and anaphylaxis; and (d) Special population: children with renal or liver dysfunction, congenital heart disease, and obesity. This guideline will hopefully help promote a rational use of intravenous AZM in children worldwide.
CONCLUSION: This guideline has summarised the evidence and has developed recommendations on the use of intravenous AZM in children worldwide. Further attention and well-designed researches should be conducted on the off-label use of intravenous AZM in children.","['Zhou P', 'Wang X', 'Zhang X', 'Xu B', 'Tong X', 'Zhou W', 'Shen K', 'Zhai S']",2021,75,7,Int J Clin Pract,"Zhou P, et al.

33413170,Legionnaire's disease presenting as bilateral central scotomata: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Legionnaire's disease is one of the major causes of community-acquired pneumonia and is occasionally complicated by neurological symptoms. However, reports of ocular lesions due to Legionnaire's disease are limited.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a patient with Legionnaire's disease presenting as bilateral central scotomata due to retinal lesions. The patient consulted due to fever and bilateral central scotomata, as well as other extrapulmonary symptoms. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed bilateral accumulations of fluid under the retina, and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral exudative retinal detachment. Later, Legionnaire's disease was confirmed by pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging and positive urinary antigen for Legionella pneumophila. After administration of antibiotics, the bilateral central scotomata and bilateral subretinal fluid accumulations completely resolved, as did the other extrapulmonary symptoms and the pulmonary infiltrates. Thus, the bilateral central scotomata due to exudative retinal detachment were thought to be caused by Legionnaire's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that Legionnaire's disease can present as bilateral central scotomata. We may consider the possibility of extrapulmonary involvement complicating Legionnaire's disease when we encounter bilateral ocular lesions in patients with fever and pneumonia.","['Yamada S', 'Kitajima T', 'Marumo S', 'Fukui M']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Yamada S, et al.

33392628,Microbial Communities' Characterization in Urban Recreational Surface Waters Using Next Generation Sequencing.,"Microbial communities in surface waters used for recreational purposes are indicators of contamination and risk of contact with human pathogens. Hence, monitoring microbial communities in recreational waters is important for potential public health threats to humans. Such monitoring is rare in Colombia, even in its capital, Bogotá, the most populous city in the country. This city encompasses metropolitan and linear parks with recreational water bodies that are used frequently by the public, and the presence of pathogens can compromise the health of the citizens. Therefore, we examined the bacterial, and eukaryotic communities in urban recreational lakes (URL) in four metropolitan parks in Bogotá, Colombia. Samples from four metropolitan parks (Los Novios, Simon Bolivar, El Tunal, and Timiza) and one stream contaminated with sewage from a linear park (El Virrey) were collected. We used amplicon next-generation sequencing of the 16S-rRNA gene and 18S-rRNA gene to characterize microbial communities followed by bioinformatics analyses. In addition, general water quality parameters-pH, hardness, acidity, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, and nitrites-were recorded using a commercial kit. Genera of pathogens, including Legionella, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, Candida, and Naegleria, were found in lake waters. The stream El Virrey was, however, the only surface water that showed an abundance of fecal bacteria, often associated with low oxygen concentrations. All water bodies showed a predominance of fungal phyla, except for the lake at Timiza. This lake showed the highest pH, and its ecological dynamics are likely different from other water bodies. Likewise, some URLs displayed a greater abundance of cyanobacteria, including toxin-producing species. Algal genera associated with eutrophication were predominant among primary producing microorganisms. This study shows for the first time the description of the bacterial and eukaryotic communities of some URLs and a stream in Bogotá. The URLs and the stream harbored various pathogens that might pose a risk to the citizen's health.","['Vega L', 'Jaimes J', 'Morales D', 'Martínez D', 'Cruz-Saavedra L', 'Muñoz M', 'Ramírez JD']",2021,81,4,Microb Ecol,"Vega L, et al.

33358259,Clinical profile and microbiological aetiology diagnosis in adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.,"Early introduction of appropriate antibiotherapy is one of the major prognostic-modifying factors in community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite established guidelines for empirical therapy, several factors may influence etiology and, consequently, antibiotic choices. The aims of this study were to analyze the etiology of CAP in adults admitted to a northern Portugal University Hospital and evaluate the yield of the different methods used to reach an etiological diagnosis, as well as analyze of the impact of patient demographic and clinical features on CAP etiology. We retrospectively analyzed 1901 cases of CAP with hospitalization. The diagnostic performance increased significantly when blood and sputum cultures were combined with urinary antigen tests. The most frequent etiological agent was Streptococcus pneumoniae (45.7%), except in August, when it was overtaken by gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Legionella pneumophila infections. Viral infections were almost exclusive to winter and spring. A negative microbiological result was associated with increasing age, non-smoking and lack of both blood/sputum cultures. Younger age was a predictor for S. pneumoniae, Influenza and L. pneumophila infections. Active smoking without any previously known respiratory disease was a risk factor for legionellosis. COPD was associated with Haemophilus influenzae cases, while dementia was typical in GNB and S. aureus patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart disease were negative predictors of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, respectively. P. aeruginosa was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 13.02, 95% CI 2.94-57.7). This study highlights the importance of a comprehensive microbiological diagnostic workup and provides clues to predicting the most probable CAP causative agents, based on a patient's clinical profile. These may be taken into account when establishing first line antibiotherapy.","['Costa MI', 'Cipriano A', 'Santos FV', 'Valdoleiros SR', 'Furtado I', 'Machado A', 'Abreu M', 'Bastos HN']",2022,28,5,Pulmonology,"Costa MI, et al.

Testing, empiric treatment, and outcomes for patients with Legionella have not been well described.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Is testing for Legionella pneumophila appropriate, and could it impact treatment?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a large retrospective cohort analysis using Premier Healthcare Database data from 2010 to 2015. We included adults with a principal diagnosis code for pneumonia (or a principal diagnosis of respiratory failure or sepsis with secondary diagnosis of pneumonia) if they also received treatment for pneumonia on hospital days 1-3. We categorized Legionella-tested patients by test result, identified patient characteristics associated with testing and test result, and examined seasonal and regional patterns of Legionella pneumonia (LP) diagnoses. Empiric therapy for LP was defined as a macrolide, quinolone, or doxycycline, administered on each of the first two hospital days.
RESULTS: Of 166,689 eligible patients, 43,070 (26%) were tested for Legionella, and 642 (1.5%) tested positive. Although only 36% of tests were ordered from June to October, 70% of positive test results occurred during this time. Only 30% of patients with hyponatremia, 32% with diarrhea, and 27% in the ICU were tested. Of patients with positive test results, 495 of 642 (77%) had received empiric Legionella therapy. Patients with LP did not have more severe presentation. They had more frequent late decompensation, but similar mortality to patients without LP.
INTERPRETATION: Legionella is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia, occurring primarily from late spring through early autumn. Testing is uncommon, even among patients with risk factors, and many patients with positive test results failed to receive empiric coverage for LP.","['Allgaier J', 'Lagu T', 'Haessler S', 'Imrey PB', 'Deshpande A', 'Guo N', 'Rothberg MB']",2021,159,5,Chest,"Allgaier J, et al.

33339738,Clinical and computed tomographic features of Legionella pneumonia with negative urine antigen test results.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella spp. can cause severe pneumonia and most Legionella pneumonia (LP) cases are diagnosed using the urine antigen test (UAT). However, diagnosis of LP with negative UAT results (LPNUAT) is challenging. We investigated the clinical and radiological features of LPNUAT.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected LP cases with positive UAT (LPPUAT) and cases of suspected LP with negative UAT that were examined by Legionella culture between July 2014 and March 2020. We investigated the clinical and CT findings for LP that showed negative UAT results and was diagnosed by culture and compared these findings with those for other pneumonias suspicious for LP with negative results in UAT and Legionella culture (OPSLP).
RESULTS: Eight LPNUAT, 20 LPPUAT, and 19 OPSLP cases were included in this study. There were no significant differences in the clinical and CT findings between LPPUAT and LPNUAT when examined by UAT. In LPNUAT, dyspnea, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and bilateral lesions were more commonly observed and inflammatory changes and the number of affected lobes were significantly higher when examined by culture than when examined by UAT. Comparison to OPSLP, LPNUAT did not show such differences, but rather showed disturbances in consciousness, hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis. Furthermore, lobar consolidation was observed more frequently and bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules were observed less frequently in LPNUAT.
CONCLUSIONS: LP characteristics such as disturbance of consciousness, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, lobar consolidation, and less bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodule contribute to the diagnosis of LP in patients with negative UAT results.","['Nakanishi M', 'Shiroshita A', 'Nakashima K', 'Takeshita M', 'Kiguchi T', 'Yamada H']",2021,59,2,Respir Investig,"Nakanishi M, et al.

Report: effect of bathing and pool operation type on water quality.","In Hungary, which is famous for its thermal baths, according to the regulations, waters are investigated in hygienic aspects with standard cultivation methods. In the present study, two thermal baths were investigated (the well and three different pool waters in both) using cultivation methods, taxon-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), multiplex PCRs and next-generation amplicon sequencing. Mainly members of the natural microbial community of the well waters and bacteria originating from the environment were detected but several opportunistic pathogenic taxa, e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, Acinetobacter johnsoni, Acinetobacter baumanni, Moraxella osloensis, Microbacterium paraoxydans, Legionella spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus were revealed by the applied methods. Pools with charging-unloading operation had higher microscopic cell counts, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, number of cocci, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus compared to the recirculation systems. Bacteria originating from human sources (e.g., skin) were identified in the pool waters with less than 1% relative abundance, and their presence was sporadic in the pools. Comparing the microbiological quality of the pools based on the first sampling time and the following four months' period it was revealed that recirculation operation type has better water quality than the charging-unloading pool operation from a hygienic point of view.","['Lippai A', 'Farkas R', 'Szuróczki S', 'Szabó A', 'Felföldi T', 'Toumi M', 'Tóth E']",2020,18,6,J Water Health,"Lippai A, et al.

Even though LD has been reported from many parts of the world, only sporadic cases have been reported in India. During February 2015-January 2020, we enrolled 597 patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia and tested respiratory secretions for Legionella spp. by using real-time PCR, and culture. A commercial urinary antigen test (UAT) was also used to detect the Legionella pneumophila (Lp) serogroup 1 antigen in urine. An LD case was defined as a patient with pneumonia and positive results for Legionella spp. infections determined by real-time PCR (from any respiratory specimen) or culture or UAT. Demographic data, risk factors, clinical, radiological, and outcome data of Lp-positive and Lp-negative patients were compared using logistic regression. Over the study period, 14 (2.3%) patients were positive for Legionella spp. infections by real-time PCR and UAT; eight (57%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and four (28.6%) in-hospital deaths occurred. Bivariate analysis showed that renal disease, neurological conditions, confusion, leukocytosis, and requirement of oxygen support were more common in the Lp-positive group than in the Lp-negative group. However, multivariate analysis failed to confirm most of these differences; renal disease was the only independent variable remaining significant. All test methods have intrinsic limitations in identifying Legionella; therefore, more than one testing method should be used. Application of molecular assays including real-time PCR has great value because of its high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid diagnostic potency. Increased awareness and improved diagnostic testing could facilitate early detection of cases, pathogen-directed therapy, and improved outcomes for patients.","['Sreenath K', 'Dey AB', 'Kabra SK', 'Thakur B', 'Guleria R', 'Chaudhry R']",2020,104,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Sreenath K, et al.

33315182,Predictors of intensive care unit admission in patients with Legionella pneumonia: role of the time to appropriate antibiotic therapy.,"PURPOSE: Legionella spp. pneumonia (LP) is a cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that requires early intervention. The median mortality rate varies from 4 to 11%, but it is higher in patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of this study is to identify predictors of ICU admission in patients with LP.
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective, observational study conducted in an academic tertiary-care hospital in Pisa, Italy. Adult patients with LP consecutively admitted to study center from October 2012 to October 2019.
RESULTS: During the study period, 116 cases of LP were observed. The rate of ICU admission was 20.7% and the overall 30-day mortality rate was 12.1%. Mortality was 4.3% in patients hospitalized in medical wards versus 41.7% in patients transferred to ICU (p < 0.001). The majority of patients (74.1%) received levofloxacin as definitive therapy, followed by macrolides (16.4%), and combination of levofloxacin plus a macrolide (9.5%). In the multivariate analysis, diabetes (OR 8.28, CI 95% 2.11-35.52, p = 0.002), bilateral pneumonia (OR 10.1, CI 95% 2.74-37.27, p = 0.001), and cardiovascular events (OR 10.91, CI 95% 2.83-42.01, p = 0.001), were independently associated with ICU admission, while the receipt of macrolides/levofloxacin therapy within 24 h from admission was protective (OR 0.20, CI 95% 0.05-0.73, p = 0.01). Patients who received a late anti-Legionella antibiotic (> 24 h from admission) underwent urinary antigen test later compared to those who received early active antibiotic therapy (2 [2-4] vs. 1 [1-2] days, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Admission to ICU carries significantly increased mortality in patients with diagnosis of LP. Initial therapy with an antibiotic active against Legionella (levofloxacin or macrolides) reduces the probability to be transferred to ICU and should be provided in all cases until Legionella etiology is excluded.","['Falcone M', 'Russo A', 'Tiseo G', 'Cesaretti M', 'Guarracino F', 'Menichetti F']",2021,49,2,Infection,"Falcone M, et al.

33309852,Activation of the Legionella pneumophila LegK7 Effector Kinase by the Host MOB1 Protein.,"Legionella pneumophila infects alveolar macrophages and can cause life-threatening pneumonia in humans. Upon internalization into the host cell, L. pneumophila injects numerous effector proteins into the host cytoplasm as a part of its pathogenesis. LegK7 is an effector kinase of L. pneumophila that functionally mimics the eukaryotic Mst kinase and phosphorylates the host MOB1 protein to exploit the Hippo pathway. To elucidate the LegK7 activation mechanism, we determined the apo structure of LegK7 in an inactive form and performed a comparative analysis of LegK7 structures. LegK7 is a non-RD kinase that contains an activation segment that is ordered, irrespective of stimulation, through a unique β-hairpin-containing segment, and it does not require phosphorylation of the activation segment for activation. Instead, bacterial LegK7 becomes an active kinase via its heterologous molecular interaction with the host MOB1 protein. MOB1 binding triggers reorientation of the two lobes of the kinase domain, as well as a structural change in the interlobe hinge region in LegK7, consequently reshaping the LegK7 structure into an ATP binding-compatible closed conformation. Furthermore, we reveal that LegK7 is an atypical kinase that contains an N-terminal capping domain and a hydrophilic interlobe linker motif, which play key roles in the MOB1-induced activation of LegK7.","['Park SC', 'Cho SY', 'Kim TH', 'Ko KY', 'Song WS', 'Kang SG', 'Lee GS', 'Yoon SI']",2021,433,3,J Mol Biol,"Park SC, et al.

33284133,European Surveillance of Legionnaires' Disease.,"Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever are both diseases with important public health implications and require prompt and thorough responses to outbreaks for future prevention. Effective methods for defining, diagnosing, reporting and responding to legionellosis outbreaks ideally should be standardized across countries. Therefore, the European Union surveillance methods for countering Legionnaires' disease is a useful model especially for travel-associated Legionnaires' disease (TALD) cases which are on the rise. Multi-country surveillance in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) has evolved since the first organizational efforts in the 1980's to the currently responsible, European Legionnaires' Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet). This chapter outlines the practices of the EU surveillance of Legionnaires' disease including their schemata, definitions, responsibilities of participating members, methods and the results of the data collected since the program's inception. Lastly, improvements must still be made as the incidence of Legionnaires' disease in the EU is likely underestimated due to underreporting and/or underdiagnosis. Nearly 70% of cases are reported from only four countries, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, which represent 50% of the EU population.","['Jong B', 'Hallström LP']",2021,42,,Curr Issues Mol Biol,Jong B and Hallström LP.

33281180,Efficacy and Effectiveness of Showerheads Attached with Point-of-use (POU) Filter Capsules in Preventing Waterborne Diseases in a Japanese Hospital.,"Tap water contamination is a growing concern in healthcare facilities, and despite chlorination, tap water in these facilities contains several pathogenic microorganisms causing healthcare-associated waterborne infections or nosocomial outbreaks. Shower units are particularly prone to contamination as they are conducive for bacterial growth and can even produce bioaerosols containing pathogenic bacteria. Shower units coupled with point-of-use (POU) water filters are a simple and safe option; however, their efficacy has been under-reported. Therefore, we determined the efficacy of showerheads attached with a POU filter capsule in preventing infections in our hospital. We investigated the presence of pathogenic bacteria in water sampled from three shower units. After replacing the original shower units with new ones incorporated with a sterile-grade water filter capsule (0.2 µm; QPoint™), the water samples were analyzed for up to 2 months. The POU filters removed several pathogenic bacteria (Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Aeromonas, and Klebsiella spp.). Filter effectiveness depends on regional water quality and we believe that effective tap water treatment combined with the use of POU filters (introduced at a reasonable cost in healthcare facilities) can considerably minimize waterborne diseases in hospitals and improve patient care.","['Sasahara T', 'Ogawa M', 'Fujimura I', 'Ae R', 'Kosami K', 'Morisawa Y']",2020,25,4,Biocontrol Sci,"Sasahara T, et al.

33276454,Growth by Insertion: The Family of Bacterial DDxP Proteins.,"We have identified a variety of proteins in species of the Legionella, Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira, Variovorax, Halomonas, and Rhizobia genera, which feature repetitive modules of different length and composition, invariably ending at the COOH side with Asp-Asp-x-Pro (DDxP) motifs. DDxP proteins range in size from 900 to 6200 aa (amino acids), and contain 1 to 5 different module types, present in one or multiple copies. We hypothesize that DDxP proteins were modeled by the action of specific endonucleases inserting DNA segments into genes encoding DDxP motifs. Target site duplications (TSDs) formed upon repair of staggered ends generated by endonuclease cleavage would explain the DDxP motifs at repeat ends. TSDs acted eventually as targets for the insertion of more modules of the same or different types. Repeat clusters plausibly resulted from amplification of both repeat and flanking TSDs. The proposed growth shown by the insertion model is supported by the identification of homologous proteins lacking repeats in Pseudomonas and Rhizobium. The 85 DDxP repeats identified in this work vary in length, and can be sorted into short (136-215 aa) and long (243-304 aa) types. Conserved Asp-Gly-Asp-Gly-Asp motifs are located 11-19 aa from the terminal DDxP motifs in all repeats, and far upstream in most long repeats.","['Di Nocera P', 'De Gregorio E']",2020,21,23,Int J Mol Sci,Di Nocera P and De Gregorio E.

33268272,Meta-analysis of fluoroquinolones versus macrolides for treatment of legionella pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: Only a single meta-analysis has reported the clinical benefit of fluoroquinolones (FQs) for Legionella pneumonia; however, there is no robust data available to confirm this result, based on current guidelines.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing FQs with macrolides (MCs) on their efficacy and safety in Legionella pneumonia, using studies published until January 2020. The outcomes included mortality (overall; 30-day), clinical cure, time to apyrexia, length of hospital stay, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Five RCTs and twelve retrospective studies were identified. Clinical cure was comparable between the treatment groups (risk rate (RR) 1.07, 95% confidential interval (CI) 0.86-1.31). Mortality was significantly higher for MCs than for FQs (overall, odd rate (OR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.98; 30-day, OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.85). FQs significantly reduced the length of hospital stay, compared to MCs (mean difference -3.58, 95% CI -5.48-1.69). Other outcomes were not significantly different between the treatment groups (time to apyrexia; mean difference -1.83, 95% CI -5.15-1.5, adverse events; OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.15). In subgroup analyses, levofloxacin significantly reduced the length of hospital stay over two specific MCs (azithromycin and clarithromycin) (mean difference -3.03, 95% CI -5.33-0.72), whereas mortality was not significantly different between the treatment groups (overall, OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.19-1.24; 30-day, OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.13-1.13).

Microbiological and water chemistry parameters in hot water throughout an Ohio hospital were monitored monthly before and after the installation of a monochloramine disinfection system over 16 months. Water samples from fifteen hot water sampling sites as well as the municipal water supply entering the hospital were analyzed using both culture and qPCR assays for specific microbial pathogens including Legionella, Pseudomonas spp., nontuberculous Mycobacteria [NTM], as well as for heterotrophic bacteria. Legionella culture assays decreased from 68% of all sites being positive prior to monochloramine addition to 6% positive after monochloramine addition, and these trends were parallel to qPCR results. Considering all samples, NTMs by culture were significantly reduced from 61% to 14% positivity (p<0.001) after monochloramine treatment. Mycobacterium genus-specific qPCR positivity was reduced from 92% to 65%, but the change was not significant. Heterotrophic bacteria (heterotrophic bacteria plate counts [HPCs]) exhibited large variability which skewed statistical results on a per room basis. However, when all samples were considered, a significant decrease in HPCs was observed after monochloramine addition. Lastly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vermamoeba vermiformis demonstrated large and significant decrease of qPCR signals post-chloramination. General water chemistry parameters including monochloramine residual, nitrate, nitrite, pH, temperature, metals and total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) were also measured. Significant monochloramine residuals were consistently observed at all sampling sites with very little free ammonia present and no water quality indications of nitrification (e.g., pH decrease, elevated nitrite or nitrate). The addition of monochloramine had no obvious impact on metals (lead, copper and iron) and disinfection by-products.","['Lytle DA', 'Pfaller S', 'Muhlen C', 'Struewing I', 'Triantafyllidou S', 'White C', 'Hayes S', 'King D', 'Lu J']",2021,189,,Water Res,"Lytle DA, et al.

33191583,The small regulatory RNA Lpr10 regulates the expression of RpoS in Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is a waterborne bacterium able to infect human alveolar macrophages, causing Legionnaires' disease. Lp can survive for several months in water, while searching for host cells to grow in, such as ciliates and amoeba. In Lp, the sigma factor RpoS is essential for survival in water. A previous transcriptomic study showed that RpoS positively regulates the small regulatory RNA Lpr10. In the present study, deletion of lpr10 results in an increased survival of Lp in water. Microarray analysis and RT-qPCR revealed that Lpr10 negatively regulates the expression of RpoS in the postexponential phase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in-line probing showed that Lpr10 binds to a region upstream of the previously identified transcription start sites (TSS) of rpoS. A third putative transcription start site was identified by primer extension analysis, upstream of the Lpr10 binding site. In addition, nlpD TSS produces a polycistronic mRNA including the downstream gene rpoS, indicating a fourth TSS for rpoS. Our results suggest that the transcripts from the third and fourth TSS are negatively regulated by the Lpr10 sRNA. Therefore, we propose that Lpr10 is involved in a negative regulatory feedback loop to maintain expression of RpoS to an optimal level.","['Saoud J', 'Carrier MC', 'Massé É', 'Faucher SP']",2021,115,4,Mol Microbiol,"Saoud J, et al.

33183356,Unravelling the importance of the eukaryotic and bacterial communities and their relationship with Legionella spp. ecology in cooling towers: a complex network.,"BACKGROUND: Cooling towers are a major source of large community-associated outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia. This disease is contracted when inhaling aerosols that are contaminated with bacteria from the genus Legionella, most importantly Legionella pneumophila. How cooling towers support the growth of this bacterium is still not well understood. As Legionella species are intracellular parasites of protozoa, it is assumed that protozoan community in cooling towers play an important role in Legionella ecology and outbreaks. However, the exact mechanism of how the eukaryotic community contributes to Legionella ecology is still unclear. Therefore, we used 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the eukaryotic communities of 18 different cooling towers. The data from the eukaryotic community was then analysed with the bacterial community of the same towers in order to understand how each community could affect Legionella spp. ecology in cooling towers.
RESULTS: We identified several microbial groups in the cooling tower ecosystem associated with Legionella spp. that suggest the presence of a microbial loop in these systems. Dissolved organic carbon was shown to be a major factor in shaping the eukaryotic community and may be an important factor for Legionella ecology. Network analysis, based on co-occurrence, revealed that Legionella was correlated with a number of different organisms. Out of these, the bacterial genus Brevundimonas and the ciliate class Oligohymenophorea were shown, through in vitro experiments, to stimulate the growth of L. pneumophila through direct and indirect mechanisms.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Legionella ecology depends on the host community, including ciliates and on several groups of organisms that contribute to its survival and growth in the cooling tower ecosystem. These findings further support the idea that some cooling tower microbiomes may promote the survival and growth of Legionella better than others.

METHODS: This study was conducted in 16 hospitals in Japan from April 2016 to December 2018. Three urinary antigen test kits were used: the novel kit (LAC-116), BinaxNOW Legionella (Binax), and Q-line Kyokutou Legionella (Q-line). In addition, sputum culture and nucleic acid detection tests and serum antibody tests were performed where possible. The diagnostic accuracy and correlations of the novel kit with the two existing kits were analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 56 patients were diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia. The sensitivities of LAC-116, Binax, and Q-line were 79%, 84%, and 71%, respectively. The overall match rate between LAC-116 and Binax was 96.8% and between LAC-116 and Q-line was 96.4%. One patient had L. pneumophila serogroup 2, and only LAC-116 showed a positive result, whereas Binax and Q-line did not.

33175075,Rapid detection of Legionella spp in water samples by ScanVIT method: comparison of acid vs heat treatment.,"BACKGROUND: A rapid detection of Legionella bacteria in water samples is crucial to minimize the risk of acquiring infections, especially in health care facilities. Different detection methods and different decontamination procedures have been reported to affect the recovery of Legionella spp. Our goal was to test the recovery of Legionella pneumophila and Legionella non-pneumophila species using a kit based on non-specific and species-specific probes to treat water samples after two different decontamination procedures.
METHODS: The study was conducted with samples collected in the teaching hospital ""Le Scotte"" of Siena (Italy). Waters samples were analyzed by: i) ScanVIT method after treatment with acids; ii) ScanVIT method after heating; and iii) cultural standard method after heating. The results of the decontamination procedures and the detection methods were evaluated by comparing the number of Legionella-positive and -negative samples, and the recovery rates (CFU l-1) obtained by ScanVIT and the standard method.
RESULTS: We find that ScanVIT method is highly sensitive with both decontamination treatments, yielding a higher recovery of L. pneumophila compared to the standard method. Conversely, ScanVIT associated with the acid-treatment yielded the highest recovery of L. non-pneumophila.
CONCLUSIONS: The acid-treatment combined to the ScanVIT method increases the recovery of L. non-pneumophila in water samples compared to both ScanVIT associated with heat-treatment and standard culture method. Thus, this method may represent the best choice to detect L. non-pneumophila in water samples and reduce the risk of infection due to underestimation of Legionella loads.","['Di Maio S', 'Messina G', 'Burgassi S', 'Cardaci R', 'Amodeo D', 'De Marco F', 'Serafini A', 'Lenzi D']",2020,32,6,Ann Ig,"Di Maio S, et al.

Therefore, the water quality of SBSs in the nosocomial environment plays a fundamental role in controlling infections for both patients and health-care workers. A long-term study on Legionella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) contamination was performed in SBSs (n = 20) of six Health Care Facilities (HCFs). A total of 254 water samples were analyzed following ISO procedures. The samples were positive for P. aeruginosa (46.85%) and Legionella (53.54%), respectively, both over the directive limits. Legionella isolates were identified as: Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) serogroups 1, 3, and 6 and Legionella non-pneumophila species (L. anisa, L. londiniensis, L. rubrilucens, and L. nagelii). Moreover, the contamination found was studied with respect to median temperature measured (42 °C), from which two groups (A and B) could be distinguished. P. aeruginosa was found in both groups (100% of SBSs), while a higher percentage of Legionella positive samples was found in group A (75% of SBSs), compared to group B (50% of SBSs), showing how Legionella control could be carried out by using temperatures above 42 °C. An analysis of SBS water pipelines, maintenance, and disinfection treatments indicates SBSs as a new source of infection risk for both patients and health-care workers.","['Girolamini L', 'Mazzotta M', 'Lizzadro J', 'Pascale MR', 'Dormi A', 'Salaris S', 'Cristino S']",2020,15,11,PLoS One,"Girolamini L, et al.

Available reviews do not mention the concurrent occurrence of both myositis and acute kidney injury.
METHODS: In order to characterize the link between bacterial community-acquired atypical pneumonia and both myositis and a renal parenchymal disease, we reviewed the literature (United States National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases).
RESULTS: We identified 42 previously healthy subjects (35 males and 7 females aged from 2 to 76, median 42 years) with a bacterial atypical pneumonia associated both with myositis (muscle pain and creatine kinase ≥5 times the upper limit of normal) and acute kidney injury (increase in creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline or increase by ≥27 μmol/L above the upper limit of normal). Thirty-six cases were caused by Legionella species (N = 27) and by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (N = 9). Further germs accounted for the remaining 6 cases. The vast majority of cases (N = 36) presented a diffuse myalgia. Only a minority of cases (N = 3) were affected by a calf myositis. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury was retained in 37 and that of acute interstitial nephritis in the remaining 5 cases.

33135033,Identification of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and machine learning techniques.,"To combat antibiotic resistance, it is extremely important to select the right antibiotic by performing rapid diagnosis of pathogens. Traditional techniques require complicated sample preparation and time-consuming processes which are not suitable for rapid diagnosis. To address this problem, we used surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning techniques for rapid identification of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus strains and Gram-negative Legionella pneumophila (control group). A total of 10 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 3 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and 6 L. pneumophila isolates were used. The obtained spectra indicated high reproducibility and repeatability with a high signal to noise ratio. Principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and various supervised classification algorithms were used to discriminate both S. aureus strains and L. pneumophila. Although there were no noteworthy differences between MRSA and MSSA spectra when viewed with the naked eye, some peak intensity ratios such as 732/958, 732/1333, and 732/1450 proved that there could be a significant indicator showing the difference between them. The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification algorithm showed superior classification performance with 97.8% accuracy among the traditional classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and naïve Bayes (NB). Our results indicate that SERS combined with machine learning can be used for the detection of antibiotic-resistant and susceptible bacteria and this technique is a very promising tool for clinical applications.","['Uysal Ciloglu F', 'Saridag AM', 'Kilic IH', 'Tokmakci M', 'Kahraman M', 'Aydin O']",2020,145,23,Analyst,"Uysal Ciloglu F, et al.

33120803,Case report: fatal pneumonia caused by new sequence type Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1.,"INTRODUCTION: Legionnaires' disease is caused by Legionella bacteria, and commonly manifests as pneumonia and has a high fatality rate.
PATIENT CONCERNS: This case study reports on the fatal incident of a patient, initially diagnosed with pneumonia, and subsequently diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease caused by a new sequence type (ST) of Legionella.
DIAGNOSIS: It is speculated that the patient acquired Legionnaires' disease from a contaminated water source. Legionnaires' disease was diagnosed using the Legionella urinary antigen assay and bacterial cultures of respiratory secretions; Legionella pneumophilia Type 1 was also identified through serological testing. Sequence-based typing of the cultured bacterium revealed it to be a previously unidentified species, and it was named ST2345 new-type.
INTERVENTIONS: In addition to the treatment of Legionnaires' disease, blood samples taken on the second day of admission showed a co-infection of Candida tropicalis, which was treated with anti-fungal treatment. The patient improved after a week, however, on the seventh day of administration lower respiratory secretions showed the growth of Klebsiella pneumonia, indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
OUTCOMES: Despite active treatment, the patient passed away due to multiple organ failure. As this was a fatal case, further research is needed to determine whether the critical condition of this case was related to the virulence of the novel Legionella strain.
CONCLUSION: A key finding of this study is that treatment for suspected Legionnaires' disease must be administered rapidly, as infection with Legionella may give rise to secondary pathogenic infections.","['Jiang L', 'Tao S', 'Mu D', 'Zhang N', 'Zhao L', 'Chen Y']",2020,99,43,Medicine (Baltimore),"Jiang L, et al.

33103530,Few bacterial co-infections but frequent empiric antibiotic use in the early phase of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: results from a multicentre retrospective cohort study in The Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge on bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 is crucial to use antibiotics appropriately. Therefore, we aimed to determine the incidence of bacterial co-infections, antibiotic use and application of antimicrobial stewardship principles in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study in four hospitals (1 university, 2 non-university teaching, 1 non-teaching hospital) in the Netherlands from March to May 2020 including consecutive patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Data on first microbiological investigations obtained at the discretion of the physician and antibiotic use in the first week of hospital admission were collected.
RESULTS: Twelve (1.2%) of the 925 patients included had a documented bacterial co-infection (75.0% pneumonia) within the first week. Microbiological testing was performed in 749 (81%) patients: sputum cultures in 105 (11.4%), blood cultures in 711 (76.9%), pneumococcal urinary antigen testing in 202 (21.8%), and 
CONCLUSIONS: On presentation to the hospital bacterial co-infections are rare, while empiric antibiotic use is abundant. This implies that in patients with COVID-19 empiric antibiotic should be withheld.

Case reports of adverse outcomes create suspicion about water birth safety, which restricts the availability of water birth in the United States. The objective of this study was to synthesize the information from case reports of adverse water birth events to identify practices associated with these outcomes, and to identify patterns of negative outcomes. The research team conducted a systematic search for cases reports of poor neonatal outcomes with water immersion. Eligible manuscripts reported any adverse neonatal outcome with immersion during labor or birth; or excluded if no adverse outcome was reported or the birth reported was unattended. A qualitative narrative synthesis was conducted to identify patterns in the reports. There were 47 cases of adverse outcomes from 35 articles included in the analysis. There was a pattern of cases of Pseudomonas and Legionella, but other infections were uncommon. There were cases of unexplained neonatal hyponatremia following water birth that need further investigation to determine the mechanism that contributes to this complication. The synthesis was limited by reporting information of interest to pediatricians with little information about water birth immersion practices. These data did not support concerns of water aspiration or cord rupture, but did identify other potential risks. Water immersion guidelines need to address infection risk, optimal management of compromised water-born infants, and the potential association between immersion practice and hyponatremia.","['Vanderlaan J', 'Hall P']",2020,34,4,J Perinat Neonatal Nurs,Vanderlaan J and Hall P.

33042538,"The burden of legionnaires' disease in Belgium, 2013 to 2017.","BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a severe bacterial infection causing pneumonia. Surveillance commonly underestimates the true incidence as not all cases are laboratory confirmed and reported to public health authorities. The aim of this study was to present indicators for the impact of LD in Belgium between 2013 and 2017 and to estimate its true burden in the Belgian population in 2017, the most recent year for which the necessary data were available.
METHODS: Belgian hospital discharge data, data from three infectious disease surveillance systems (mandatory notification, sentinel laboratories and the national reference center), information on reimbursed diagnostic tests from the Belgian National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance and mortality data from the Belgian statistical office were used. To arrive at an estimate of the total number of symptomatic cases in Belgium, we defined a surveillance pyramid and estimated a multiplication factor to account for LD cases not captured by surveillance. The multiplication factor was then applied to the pooled number of LD cases reported by the three surveillance systems. This estimate was the basis for our hazard- and incidence-based Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) calculation. To account for uncertainty in the estimations of the DALYs and the true incidence, we used Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 iterations.
RESULTS: We found an average of 184 LD cases reported by Belgian hospitals annually (2013-2017), the majority of which were male (72%). The surveillance databases reported 215 LD cases per year on average, 11% of which were fatal within 90 days after diagnosis. The estimation of the true incidence in the community yielded 2674 (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 2425-2965) cases in 2017. LD caused 3.05 DALYs per case (95%UI: 1.67-4.65) and 8147 (95%UI: 4453-12,426) total DALYs in Belgium in 2017, which corresponds to 71.96 (95%UI: 39.33-109.75) DALYs per 100,000 persons.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis revealed a considerable burden of LD in Belgium that is vastly underestimated by surveillance data. Comparison with other European DALY estimates underlines the impact of the used data sources and methodological approaches on burden estimates, illustrating that national burden of disease studies remain essential.","['Fastl C', 'Devleesschauwer B', 'van Cauteren D', 'Lajot A', 'Leroy M', 'Laisnez V', 'Schirvel C', 'Mahieu R', 'Pierard D', 'Michel C', 'Jacquinet S']",2020,78,,Arch Public Health,"Fastl C, et al.

33039832,Evaluating method and potential risks of chlorine-resistant bacteria (CRB): A review.,"Chlorine-resistant bacteria (CRB) are commonly defined as bacteria with high resistance to chlorine disinfection or bacteria which can survive or even regrow in the residual chlorine. Chlorine disinfection cannot completely control the risks of CRB, such as risks of pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance and microbial growth. Currently, researchers pay more attention to CRB with pathogenicity or antibiotic resistance. The microbial growth risks of non-pathogenic CRB in water treatment and reclamation systems have been neglected to some extent. In this review, these three kinds of risks are all analyzed, and the last one is also highlighted. In order to study CRB, various methods are used to evaluate chlorine resistance. This review summarizes the evaluating methods for chlorine resistance reported in the literatures, and collects the important information about the typical isolated CRB strains including their genera, sources and levels of chlorine resistance. To our knowledge, few review papers have provided such systematic information about CRB. Among 44 typical CRB strains from 17 genera isolated by researchers, Mycobacterium, Bacillus, Legionella, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas were the five genera with the highest frequency of occurrence in literatures. They are all pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. In addition, although there are many studies on CRB, information about chlorine resistance level is still limited to specie level or strain level. The difference in chlorine resistance level among different bacterial genera is less well understood. An inconvenient truth is that there is still no widely-accepted method to evaluate chlorine resistance and to identify CRB. Due to the lack of a unified method, it is difficult to compare the results about chlorine resistance level of bacterial strains in different literatures. A recommended evaluating method using logarithmic removal rate as an index and E. coli as a reference strain is proposed in this review based on the summary of the current evaluating methods. This method can provide common range of chlorine resistance of each genus and it is conducive to analyzing the distribution and abundance of CRB in the environment.","['Luo LW', 'Wu YH', 'Yu T', 'Wang YH', 'Chen GQ', 'Tong X', 'Bai Y', 'Xu C', 'Wang HB', 'Ikuno N', 'Hu HY']",2021,188,,Water Res,"Luo LW, et al.

33030784,The role of typical and atypical pathogens in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"OBJECTIVES: The exact role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations remains to be elucidated. This study was conducted to identify nonspecific and atypical pathogens associated with acute exacerbations of COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2013 and February 2015, 107 patients were analyzed. Sixty-nine comprised the inpatient and 38 comprised the outpatient treatment group.
RESULTS: When nonspecific culture results were taken into consideration only a causative organism could be detected in 46.7% of the patients. The detection rate increased to 85.1% with the additional use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, and culture methods. More than one causative agent was responsible for COPD exacerbation in 53.3% of patients: two agents in 37.3%, three agents in 15%, and four agents in 0.9%. H. influenzae was detected in 63 (58.9%) patients, S. pneumoniae in 57 (53.2%), P. aeruginosa in 15 (14.0%), and L. pneumophila in 11 (10%). L. pneumophila was the more commonly isolated agent in the inpatient group (P = 0.002). Patients receiving continuous oxygen therapy and noninvasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to have an exacerbation associated with P. aeruginosa (P = 0.008 and P = 0.009, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The additional use of DFA for Legionella and multiplex PCR in combination with nonspecific microbiological culturing methods greatly improves the ability to identify infectious agents in acute exacerbations of COPD. There should be a high index of suspicion for P.aeruginosa as a causative organism, particularly in subjects receiving continuous oxygen therapy and/or using NIV and L. pneumophila should certainly be taken into consideration in severe COPD exacerbations.","['Yildiz S', 'Gonullu N', 'Yildiz BP', 'Hattatoglu DG', 'Kuskucu M', 'Midilli K', 'Aygun G', 'Mayda PY', 'Musellim B']",2021,15,2,Clin Respir J,"Yildiz S, et al.

33028429,Understanding the distribution of positive Legionella samples in healthcare-premise water systems: Using statistical analysis to determine a distribution for Legionella and to support sample size recommendations.,"OBJECTIVE: To significantly fit a statistical distribution to the proportion of positive Legionella samples in a series of water samples from multiple facility-premise water systems.
DESIGN: Statistical fit test.
SETTING: A hospital and associated long-term care facility (LTCF) in New York State, as well as temporal and culture data from a deidentified hospital site supplied by one of the vendor laboratories.
METHODS: Culture samples (n = 1,393) were segmented into 139 test cycles with roughly 10 samples in each. The proportion of positive samples was standardized to 25 total samples per test to give a distribution of discrete values. These values were analyzed for fit with the following discrete distributions: Poisson, negative binomial, geometric, and zero-inflated Poisson.
RESULTS: The zero-inflated Poisson distribution fitted to the copper-silver ionization (CSI)-treated and untreated test cycles indicates that 88% of the expected positive proportions should occur by the 30% cutoff (rounded up to 8 positive samples among 25 total samples), similar to the 93% expectation for just CSI-treated test cycles.

CONCLUSIONS: In a well-maintained or well-treated premise water distribution system, ~30% or lower proportion of positive Legionella samples should occur.

33024033,Molecular Mimicry: a Paradigm of Host-Microbe Coevolution Illustrated by Legionella.,"Through coevolution with host cells, microorganisms have acquired mechanisms to avoid the detection by the host surveillance system and to use the cell's supplies to establish themselves. Indeed, certain pathogens have evolved proteins that imitate specific eukaryotic cell proteins, allowing them to manipulate host pathways, a phenomenon termed molecular mimicry. Bacterial ""eukaryotic-like proteins"" are a remarkable example of molecular mimicry. They are defined as proteins that strongly resemble eukaryotic proteins or that carry domains that are predominantly present in eukaryotes and that are generally absent from prokaryotes. The widest diversity of eukaryotic-like proteins known to date can be found in members of the bacterial genus ","['Mondino S', 'Schmidt S', 'Buchrieser C']",2020,11,5,mBio,"Mondino S, et al.

This invasive pest species, known to transmit several tick-borne pathogens in its native range, is a potential threat to wildlife, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. Questing larval (n = 25), nymph (n = 10), and adult (n = 123), along with host-derived adult (n = 25) H. longicornis ticks were collected from various locations on Staten Island, NY. The pathobiome of each specimen was examined using two different high throughput sequencing approaches, virus enrichment and shotgun metagenomics. An average of 45,828,061 total reads per sample were recovered from the virus enriched samples and an average of 11,381,144 total reads per sample were obtained using shotgun metagenomics. Aside from endogenous viral sequences, no viruses were identified through either approach. Through shotgun metagenomics, Coxiella-like bacteria, Legionella, Sphingomonas, and other bacterial species were recovered. The Coxiella-like agent was ubiquitous and present at high abundances in all samples, suggesting it may be an endosymbiont. The other bacterial agents are not known to be transmitted by ticks. From these analyses, H. longicornis do not appear to host any endemic human tick-borne pathogens in the New York City region.","['Tufts DM', 'Sameroff S', 'Tagliafierro T', 'Jain K', 'Oleynik A', 'VanAcker MC', 'Diuk-Wasser MA', 'Lipkin WI', 'Tokarz R']",2020,11,6,Ticks Tick Borne Dis,"Tufts DM, et al.

32985035,"""Parasite turnover zone"" at secondary contact: A new pattern in host-parasite population genetics.","We describe here a new pattern of population genetic structure in a host-parasite system that can arise after secondary contact of previously isolated populations. Due to different generation times, and therefore different tempos of molecular evolution, the host and parasite populations reach different degrees of genetic differentiation during their separation (e.g., in refugia). Consequently, upon secondary contact, the host populations are able to re-establish a single panmictic population across the area of contact, while the parasite populations stop their dispersal at the secondary contact zone and create a narrow hybrid zone. From the host's perspective, the parasite's hybrid zone functions on a microevolutionary scale as a ""parasite turnover zone"": while the hosts are passing from area A to area B, their parasites turn genetically from the area A genotypes to the area B genotypes. We demonstrate this novel pattern with a model composed of Apodemus mice and Polyplax lice by comparing maternally inherited markers (complete mitochondrial genomes, and complete genomes of the vertically transmitted symbiont Legionella polyplacis) with single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from louse genomic data. We discuss the circumstances that may lead to this pattern and possible reasons why it has been overlooked in studies of host-parasite population genetics.","['Martinů J', 'Štefka J', 'Poosakkannu A', 'Hypša V']",2020,29,23,Mol Ecol,"Martinů J, et al.

32979571,"Nationwide outbreak of invasive listeriosis associated with consumption of meat products in health care facilities, Germany, 2014-2019.","OBJECTIVES: Invasive listeriosis is a severe foodborne infection caused by Listeria(L.)monocytogenes. The aim of this investigation was to verify and describe a molecular cluster of listeriosis patients and identify factors leading to this outbreak.
METHODS: Whole genome sequencing and core genome multilocus sequence typing were used for subtyping L. monocytogenes isolates from listeriosis cases and food samples in Germany. Patient interviews and investigational tracing of foodstuffs offered in health-care facilities (HCF), where some of the cases occurred, were conducted.
RESULTS: We identified a German-wide listeriosis outbreak with 39 genetically related cases occurring between 2014 and 2019. Three patients died as a result of listeriosis. After identification of HCF in different regions of Germany for at least 13 cases as places of exposure, investigational tracing of food supplies in six prioritized HCF revealed meat products from one company (X) as a commonality. Subsequently the outbreak strain was analysed in six isolates from ready-to-eat meat products and one isolate from the production environment of company X. No further Sigma1 cases were detected after recall of the meat products from the market and closure of company X (as of August 2020).
CONCLUSIONS: Interdisciplinary efforts including whole genome sequencing, epidemiological investigations in patients and investigational tracing of foods were essential to identify the source of infections, and thereby prevent further illnesses and deaths. This outbreak underlines the vulnerability of hospitalized patients for foodborne diseases, such as listeriosis. Food producers and HCF should minimize the risk of microbiological hazards when producing, selecting and preparing food for patients.","['Lachmann R', 'Halbedel S', 'Adler M', 'Becker N', 'Allerberger F', 'Holzer A', 'Boone I', 'Falkenhorst G', 'Kleta S', 'Al Dahouk S', 'Stark K', 'Luber P', 'Flieger A', 'Wilking H']",2021,27,7,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Lachmann R, et al.

32976823,Impact of lockdown on the microbiological status of the hospital water network during COVID-19 pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic started in China in early December 2019, and quickly spread around the world. The epidemic gradually started in Italy at the end of February 2020, and by May 31, 2020, 232,664 cases and 33,340 deaths were confirmed. As a result of this pandemic, the Italian Ministerial Decree issued on March 11, 2020, enforced lockdown; therefore, many social, recreational, and cultural centers remained closed for months. In Apulia (southern Italy), all non-urgent hospital activities were suspended, and some wards were closed, with a consequent reduction in the use of the water network and the formation of stagnant water. This situation could enhance the risk of exposure of people to waterborne diseases, including legionellosis. The purpose of this study was to monitor the microbiological quality of the water network (coliforms, E. coli, Enterococci, P. aeruginosa, and Legionella) in three wards (A, B and C) of a large COVID-19 regional hospital, closed for three months due to the COVID-19 emergency. Our study revealed that all three wards' water network showed higher contamination by Legionella pneumophila sg 1 and sg 6 at T1 (after lockdown) compared to the period before the lockdown (T0). In particular, ward A at T1 showed a median value = 5600 CFU/L (range 0-91,000 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 75 CFU/L (range 0-5000 CFU/L) (p-value = 0.014); ward B at T1 showed a median value = 200 CFU/L (range 0-4200 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 0 CFU/L (range 0-300 CFU/L) (p-value = 0.016) and ward C at T1 showed a median value = 175 CFU/L (range 0-22,000 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 0 CFU/L (range 0-340 CFU/L) (p-value < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was detected in ward B between the number of positive water samples at T0 vs T1 for L. pneumophila sg 1 and sg 6 (24% vs 80% p-value < 0.001) and for coliforms (0% vs 64% p-value < 0.001). Moreover, a median value of coliform load resulted 3 CFU/100 ml (range 0-14 CFU/100 ml) at T1, showing a statistically significant increase versus T0 (0 CFU/100 ml) (p-value < 0.001).

32951019,"Quorum sensing controls persistence, resuscitation, and virulence of Legionella subpopulations in biofilms.","The water-borne bacterium Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. In the environment, the opportunistic pathogen colonizes different niches, including free-living protozoa and biofilms. The physiological state(s) of sessile Legionella in biofilms and their functional consequences are not well understood. Using single-cell techniques and fluorescent growth rate probes as well as promoter reporters, we show here that sessile L. pneumophila exhibits phenotypic heterogeneity and adopts growing and nongrowing (""dormant"") states in biofilms and microcolonies. Phenotypic heterogeneity is controlled by the Legionella quorum sensing (Lqs) system, the transcription factor LvbR, and the temperature. The Lqs system and LvbR determine the ratio between growing and nongrowing sessile subpopulations, as well as the frequency of growth resumption (""resuscitation"") and microcolony formation of individual bacteria. Nongrowing L. pneumophila cells are metabolically active, express virulence genes and show tolerance toward antibiotics. Therefore, these sessile nongrowers are persisters. Taken together, the Lqs system, LvbR and the temperature control the phenotypic heterogeneity of sessile L. pneumophila, and these factors regulate the formation of a distinct subpopulation of nongrowing, antibiotic tolerant, virulent persisters. Hence, the biofilm niche of L. pneumophila has a profound impact on the ecology and virulence of this opportunistic pathogen.","['Personnic N', 'Striednig B', 'Hilbi H']",2021,15,1,ISME J,"Personnic N, et al.

However, the role of A. castellanii in the microbial community is still unknown because of the lack of studies on multiple-species interactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the change of bacterial composition after A. castellanii emerges in a water environment. We added A. castellanii to an environmental water sample and incubated it for two days. Then, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing techniques to analyze the changes in bacterial composition. In this study, A. castellanii slightly increased the relative abundance of a few opportunistic pathogens, such as Legionella, Roseomonas, and Haemophilus. This result may be related to the training ground hypothesis. On the other hand, the growth of some bacteria was inhibited, such as Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes. Although A. castellanii did not drastically change the whole bacterial community, we surprisingly found the dissolved oxygen concentration was increased after incubation with A. castellanii. We applied environmental water at the laboratory scale to investigate the interactions among A. castellanii, complex microbial communities and the environment. We identified the bacteria that are sensitive to A. castellanii and further found the novel relationship between dissolved oxygen and microbial interaction. Our results helped to clarify the role of A. castellanii in microbial communities.","['Tsai CM', 'Chen JW', 'Lin WC']",2020,218,,Exp Parasitol,"Tsai CM, et al.

Thirty Sp-positive or contrived cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) were also tested. Test specimens were collected and tested at different sites, with each site testing unique specimens by technologists blinded to expected results. No significant differences in test concordances were detected for the ImmuView and BinaxNOW assays for the Sp or Lp targets for urine from patients with pneumococcal pneumonia or LD when performance from both sites were combined. At one of two test sites the ImmuView Lp assay was more sensitive than the BinaxNOW assay, with no correlation between test performance and Lp serogroup 1 monoclonal type. Urines from six of seven patients with LD caused by Legionella spp. bacteria other than Lp serogroup 1 were negative in both assays. Both tests had equivalent performance for Sp-positive CSF. The clinical sensitivities for pneumococcal pneumonia were 88.1 and 94.4% for the ImmuView and Binax assays, and 87.6 and 84.2% for the Lp assays, respectively. Test specificities for pneumococcal pneumonia were 96.2 and 97.0% for the ImmuView and Binax assays, and 99.6 and 99.1% for the Lp assays. Both assays were highly specific for Sp in pediatric urines from children with nasopharyngeal colonization by the bacterium.

32860684,Impact of inter-amoebic phagocytosis on the L. pneumophila growth.,"Free-living amoebae are known to act as replication niches for the pathogenic bacterium Legionella pneumophila in freshwater environments. However, we previously reported that some strains of the Willaertia magna species are more resistant to L. pneumophila infection and differ in their ability to support its growth. From this observation, we hypothesize that L. pneumophila growth in environment could be partly dependent on the composition of amoebic populations and on the possible interactions between different amoebic species. We tested this hypothesis by studying the growth of L. pneumophila and of a permissive free-living amoeba, Vermamoeba vermiformis (formerly named Hartmannella vermiformis), in co-culture with or without other free-living amoebae (Acanthamoeba castellanii and W. magna). We demonstrate the occurrence of inter-amoebic phagocytosis with A. castellanii and W. magna being able to ingest V. vermiformis infected or not infected with L. pneumophila. We also found that L. pneumophila growth is strongly impacted by the permissiveness of each interactive amoeba demonstrating that L. pneumophila proliferation and spread are controlled, at least in part, by inter-amoebic interactions.","['Dey R', 'Mameri MR', 'Trajkovic-Bodennec S', 'Bodennec J', 'Pernin P']",2020,367,18,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Dey R, et al.

METHODS: In this study, we estimated the annual incidence of Legionnaires' disease-associated hospitalizations in United States and identified demographic, temporal, and regional characteristics of individuals hospitalized for Legionnaires' disease. A retrospective study was conducted using the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) data from 2006 to 2010. The NHDS is a nationally representative US survey, which includes estimates of inpatient stays in short-stay hospitals in the United States, excluding federal, military, and Veterans Administration hospitals. All discharges assigned with the Legionnaires' disease 
RESULTS: We observed the annual incidence and number of Legionnaires' disease-associated hospitalizations (per 100 000 population) in the United States by year, age, sex, race, and region. Over a 5-year period, 14 574 individuals experienced Legionnaires' disease-associated hospitalizations in the United States The annual population-adjusted incidence (per 100 000 population) of Legionnaires' disease-associated hospitalizations was 5.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.12-5.64) in 2006, 7.06 (95% CI, 6.80-7.40) in 2007, 8.77 (95% CI, 8.44-9.11) in 2008, 17.07 (95% CI, 16.62-17.54) in 2009, and 9.66 (95% CI, 9.32-10.01) in 2010. A summer peak of Legionnaires' disease-associated hospitalizations occurred from June through September in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: Legionnaires' disease-associated hospitalizations significantly increased over the 5-year study period. The increasing disease burden of Legionnaires' disease suggests that large segments of the US population are at risk for exposure to this waterborne pathogen.","['Mudali G', 'Kilgore PE', 'Salim A', 'McElmurry SP', 'Zervos M']",2020,7,8,Open Forum Infect Dis,"Mudali G, et al.

Stagnant water can have chemical and microbiological contaminants that pose potential health risks to occupants. Health officials, building owners, utilities, and other entities are rapidly developing guidance to address this issue, but the scope, applicability, and details included in the guidance vary widely. To provide a primer of large building water system preventative and remedial strategies, peer-reviewed, government, industry, and nonprofit literature relevant to water stagnation and decontamination practices for plumbing was synthesized. Preventative practices to help avoid the need for recommissioning (e.g., routine flushing) and specific actions, challenges, and limitations associated with recommissioning were identified and characterized. Considerations for worker and occupant safety were also indicated.

32827981,Microbiological examination of water and aerosols from four industrial evaporative cooling systems in regard to risk of Legionella emissions and methodological suggestions for surveillance.,"The hygienic risk associated with evaporative cooling systems in Germany is currently only assessed by determining concentrations of Legionella spp. in the corresponding cooling waters. Relevant for the health risk is however the load of Legionella in emitted aerosols. In this work aerosol emissions from four industrial cooling systems (A - D) were analyzed. A microbiological air bioburden factor (MABF) is suggested to be useful to assess the overall microbiological load of emitted air and to judge the efficiency of droplet separation and overall microbiological retention. Whereas the MABF by itself only serves as a technical quality assurance (QA) parameter, the hygienic relevance has to be seen in combination with the assessment of Legionella either contained in the aerosol or in the cooling water. Plate counting of colonies was an appropriate method to quantify Legionella spp. in aerosols given the short time of flight at the chosen sampling locations and resulting low risk of desiccation. qPCR data on the other hand proved more reproducible than the culture approach to quantify Legionella spp. concentrations in cooling water-. The application of qPCR also allowed to assess the relative proportion of Legionella pneumophila within the total pool of Legionella which adds epidemiological relevance to risk assessment. A traffic light system was proposed to guide interpretation of qPCR data. The four industrial systems greatly differed in all measured parameters leading to different associated risks.","['Nocker A', 'Schulte-Illingheim L', 'Frösler J', 'Welp L', 'Sperber O', 'Hugo A']",2020,229,,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Nocker A, et al.

32787730,"Stress, Coping, Resilience and Trust during the Flint Water Crisis.","In 2014, government officials in the City of Flint, Michigan switched the municipal water source from the Detroit Water System (water source: Lake Huron) to the Flint River. During this time, an estimated 102,000 Flint residents were potentially exposed to multiple chemical (e.g., lead) and biological threats (e.g., Legionella). After the switch to water sourced from the Flint River, Flint residents consistently reported concerns over water quality while also experiencing rashes, hair loss, and other health problems, including anxiety and depression. This study 1) reports on the Flint Water Crisis and its subsequent impact on residents' stress, coping, resilience and trust and 2) describes a process methodology that trained, hired and deployed Flint residents as members of a multidisciplinary research team. A random sample of 320 Flint residents underwent household-based interviews to assess their health and mental health needs. Concomitantly, household water samples were obtained and residents were connected to known resources based on interview responses relative to need. This study found that declines in health and mental health status were correlated with increased stressors (i.e., fatigue, financial concern, anxiety), coping and less resilience or the capacity to recover. Perceived trust in government officials was significantly lower after the water crisis. While the water crisis generated numerous stressors, the event also galvanized community competence to engage in solution-focused coping and other adaptive capacities. By assessing and building upon Flint residents' resilience, community resource specialists, identified and subsequently strengthened city residents' ability to survive devastating challenges.","['Sobeck J', 'Smith-Darden J', 'Hicks M', 'Kernsmith P', 'Kilgore PE', 'Treemore-Spears L', 'McElmurry S']",2020,46,3-4,Behav Med,"Sobeck J, et al.

32771655,Potent T-cell mediated immune response against Legionella pneumophila in mice following vaccination with detoxified lipopolysaccharide non-covalently combined with recombinant flagellin A and peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium and the cause of an atypical pneumonia in humans - legionnaire's disease. Immunological assessment of bacterial antigens clarifies the way that host may develop protection against the pathogen. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main antigen of Gram-negative bacteria but is less studied because of its carbohydrate nature. Here, we immunized mice with detoxified LPS in combination with immunogenic proteins and looked into the result of bacterial challenge.
METHODS: LPS of L. pneumophila was extracted by hot phenol-water method. Purified LPS was detoxified by sodium hydroxide alkaline procedure. BALB/c mice were immunized mainly with non-covalent combination of detoxified LPS (dLPS) and either of recombinant FlaA or PAL separately. Afterwards, specific serum IgG was assessed by ELISA. Mice were challenged intravenously with sublethal dose of L. pneumpphila then splenocytes were cultured. Cytokine responses of splenocytes were analyzed by ELISA.
RESULTS: Polysaccharide antigen did not elicit significant serum IgG. Combination of the dLPS with recombinant FlaA and PAL led to risen IgG and its subclasses (IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b) against polysaccharide. Mice immunized with combination of the dLPS and recombinant proteins showed significant elevation of cytokine responses in splenocyte culture after being challenged with L. pneumophila.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that combination of polysaccharide antigen derived from Legionella LPS may confer raised cell-mediated responses against the pathogen when combined with Th-1 stimulating protein antigens. Although not covalently bond, Legionella detoxified LPS combination with recombinant FlaA and PAL effectively elicited Th-1 type cytokines and humoral responses against L. pneumophila in BALB/c mice.","['Mehdi Abdol M', 'Mohabati Mobarez A', 'Khoramabadi N', 'Papian S', 'Talebi Bezmin Abadi A']",2020,149,,Microb Pathog,"Mehdi Abdol M, et al.

32771367,Determination of the bacterial microbiome of free-living amoebae isolated from wastewater by 16S rRNA amplicon-based sequencing.,"Free-living amoebae (FLA) are ubiquitous protozoa commonly found in water. FLA are well-established hosts for amoeba-resistant bacteria, most of which are pathogenic, and offer them shelter from adverse environmental conditions or water treatments. Since there is very little knowledge about the complete bacterial microbiome of FLA, in this work the bacterial microbiome of FLA isolated from wastewater both after secondary and tertiary treatments was studied by amplicon-based sequencing. FLA were detected in 87.5% and 50.0% of wastewater samples taken after secondary and tertiary disinfection treatments, respectively. The most abundant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, which represented 83.77% of the total bacterial FLA microbiome. The most abundant class of bacteria was Gammaproteobacteria, which contains an important number of relevant pathogenic bacteria. The bacteria of public health concern Aeromonas, Arcobacter, Campylobacter, Helicobacter, Klebsiella, Legionella, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas and Salmonella were detected as part of the FLA microbiome. Although different microbial communities were identified in each sample, there is no correlation between the microbiome of FLA and the extent of wastewater treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first work in which the bacterial microbiome of FLA isolated from wastewater is studied.

32770825,Bacterial co-infections with SARS-CoV-2.,"The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected millions of people worldwide. To date, there are no proven effective therapies for this virus. Efforts made to develop antiviral strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 are underway. Respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, predispose patients to co-infections and these lead to increased disease severity and mortality. Numerous types of antibiotics such as azithromycin have been employed for the prevention and treatment of bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infections in patients with a viral respiratory infection (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). Although antibiotics do not directly affect SARS-CoV-2, viral respiratory infections often result in bacterial pneumonia. It is possible that some patients die from bacterial co-infection rather than virus itself. To date, a considerable number of bacterial strains have been resistant to various antibiotics such as azithromycin, and the overuse could render those or other antibiotics even less effective. Therefore, bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infection are considered critical risk factors for the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19. Also, the antibiotic-resistant as a result of overusing must be considered. In this review, we will summarize the bacterial co-infection and secondary bacterial infection in some featured respiratory viral infections, especially COVID-19.","['Mirzaei R', 'Goodarzi P', 'Asadi M', 'Soltani A', 'Aljanabi HAA', 'Jeda AS', 'Dashtbin S', 'Jalalifar S', 'Mohammadzadeh R', 'Teimoori A', 'Tari K', 'Salari M', 'Ghiasvand S', 'Kazemi S', 'Yousefimashouf R', 'Keyvani H', 'Karampoor S']",2020,72,10,IUBMB Life,"Mirzaei R, et al.

32745749,High-throughput diagnosis of human pathogens and fecal contamination in marine recreational water.,"Waterborne pathogens and their associated diseases are major threats to public health, and surveillance of pathogens and identification of the sources of pollution are imperative for preventing infections. However, simultaneously quantitative detection of multiple pathogens and pollution sources in water environments is the major challenge. In this study, we developed and validated a highly sensitive (mostly >80%) and highly specific (>99%) high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) approach, which could simultaneously quantify 68 marker genes of 33 human pathogens and 23 fecal markers of 10 hosts. The HT-qPCR approach was then successfully used to investigate pathogens and fecal pollution in marine recreational water samples of Xiamen, China. Totally, seven pathogenic marker genes were found in 13 beach bathing waters, which targeted Acanthamoeba spp., Clostridium perfringens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio cholera/V. parahaemolyticus and Legionella spp.. Fecal markers from human and dog were the most frequently detected, indicating human and dog feces were the main contamination in the recreational waters. Nanopore sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA gene revealed that 28 potential human pathogens were detected and electrical conductivity, salinity, oxidation-reduction potential and dissolved oxygen were significantly correlated with the variation in bacterial community. Our results demonstrated that HT-qPCR approach had the potential rapid quantification of microbial contamination, providing useful data for assessment of microbial pathogen associated health risk and development of management practices to protect human health.","['An XL', 'Wang JY', 'Pu Q', 'Li H', 'Pan T', 'Li HQ', 'Pan FX', 'Su JQ']",2020,190,,Environ Res,"An XL, et al.

32729154,"Molecular mechanisms activating the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome: Implications in infectious disease, autoinflammation, and cancer.","Cytosolic innate immune sensing is a cornerstone of innate immunity in mammalian cells and provides a surveillance system for invading pathogens and endogenous danger signals. The NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome responds to cytosolic flagellin, and the inner rod and needle proteins of the type 3 secretion system of bacteria. This complex induces caspase-1-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and the pore-forming protein gasdermin D, leading to inflammation and pyroptosis, respectively. Localized responses triggered by the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome are largely protective against bacterial pathogens, owing to several mechanisms, including the release of inflammatory mediators, liberation of concealed intracellular pathogens for killing by other immune mechanisms, activation of apoptotic caspases, caspase-7, and caspase-8, and expulsion of an entire infected cell from the mammalian host. In contrast, aberrant activation of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome caused by de novo gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding NLRC4 can lead to macrophage activation syndrome, neonatal enterocolitis, fetal thrombotic vasculopathy, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, and even death. Some of these clinical manifestations could be treated by therapeutics targeting inflammasome-associated cytokines. In addition, the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, melanoma, glioma, and breast cancer. However, no consensus has been reached on its function in the development of any cancer types. In this review, we highlight the latest advances in the activation mechanisms and structural assembly of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome, and the functions of this inflammasome in different cell types.

32727982,Legionellosis in Japan: A Self-inflicted Wound?,"Legionellosis is a serious bacterial infection characterized by atypical pneumonia primarily due to infection with Legionella pneumophila, and bathing can be a potential cause of this infection. Legionellosis was first identified in 1977, and it is caused by Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Legionella. Legionellosis remains an important public health threat, particularly in Japan, where the population is rapidly aging, thereby becoming more at risk of developing severe disease and accompanying life-threatening pneumonia. The bacteria are most commonly transmitted via the inhalation of contaminated aerosols produced and broadcast via water sprays, jets or mists. Infection can also occur via the aspiration of contaminated water or ice, or through inhalation of contaminated dust. Because the signs and symptoms of Legionnaires' disease (LD), as well as radiographic imaging are similar to pneumonia caused by other pathogens, a specific diagnostic test is required, such as a urine antigen detection test. Six clinical and laboratory parameters, a high body temperature, a non-productive cough, low serum sodium and platelet counts, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and c-reactive protein concentrations can be used to reliably predict the likelihood of LD. The first choices for chemotherapy are fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotic drugs. The main goals of LD prevention measures are 1) the prevention of microbial growth and biofilm formation, 2) the removal of all biofilm formed on equipment and in facilities, 3) minimizing aerosol splash and spread, and 4) minimizing bacterial contamination from external sources. It is apparent that, in Japan, where hot spring (onsen) bathing is common among aged people, strict regulations need to be in place - and enforced - to ensure that all Japanese onsens and spas provide a safe environment and undertake regular, effective infection control practices.","['Tanimoto T', 'Takahashi K', 'Crump A']",2021,60,2,Intern Med,"Tanimoto T, et al.

Mammalian genomes encode about 100 different DUBs, which can be grouped into seven different classes. Members of other DUB classes are found in pathogenic bacteria, which use them to target the host defense. By combining bioinformatical and experimental approaches, we address the question if the known DUB families have a common evolutionary ancestry and share conserved features that set them apart from other proteases. By systematically comparing family-specific hidden Markov models, we uncovered distant relationships between established DUBs and other cysteine protease families. Most DUB families share a conserved aromatic residue linked to the active site, which restricts the cleavage of substrates with side chains at the S2 position, corresponding to Gly-75 in ubiquitin.

The flagellum plays a key role in the pathogenesis of L. pneumophila in the host. The protein FlgL forms a junction between the flagellar hook and filament and has been reported to elicit the host humoral immune response. To provide structural insights into FlgL-mediated junction assembly and FlgL-based vaccine design, we performed structural and serological studies on L. pneumophila FlgL (lpFlgL). The crystal structure of a truncated lpFlgL protein that consists of the D1 and D2 domains was determined at 3.06 Å resolution. The D1 domain of lpFlgL adopts a primarily helical, rod-shaped structure, and the D2 domain folds into a β-sandwich structure that is affixed to the upper region of the D1 domain. The D1 domain of lpFlgL exhibits structural similarity to the flagellar filament protein flagellin, allowing us to propose a structural model of the lpFlgL junction based on the polymeric structure of flagellin. Furthermore, the D1 domain of lpFlgL exhibited substantially higher protein stability than the D2 domain and was responsible for most of the antigenicity of lpFlgL, suggesting that the D1 domain of lpFlgL would be a suitable target for the development of an anti-L. pneumophila vaccine.","['Song WS', 'Hong HJ', 'Yoon SI']",2020,529,2,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Song WS, et al.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main antigen of Gram-negative bacteria but is less studied because of its carbohydrate nature. Here, we immunized mice with detoxified LPS and O-antigen polysaccharide in combination with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and explored the immunological responses of mice to the bacterial infection. LPS of L. pneumophila was extracted by hot phenol-water method. Purified LPS was detoxified by sodium hydroxide alkaline procedure. O-polysaccharide antigen (OPS) obtained by acetic acid treatment of LPS. BALB/c mice were immunized mainly with non-covalent combination of detoxified LPS (dLPS) or OPS with BSA separately. Pure polysaccharide antigens did not elicit significant serum IgG against LPS. Combination of the dLPS and OPS with BSA resulted in risen IgG and its subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2a) against lipopolysaccharide. Mice were challenged intravenously with sublethal dose of L. pneumpphila. Then, splenocytes were cultured and cytokine responses of splenocytes to pathogenic Legionella was studied by ELISA. Mice immunized with combination of the dLPS or OPS and BSA showed significant elevation of cytokine responses to pathogenic L. pneumophila. Our results suggest that combination of the polysaccharide antigen derived from Legionella LPS may confer raised cell-mediated responses against the pathogen when combined with a protein antigen which is capable of eliciting cell-mediated responses. Although not covalently bond, Legionella polysaccharides combined with BSA effectively elicited Th-1 type cytokines and humoral responses against L. pneumophila in BALB/c mice.","['Papian S', 'Mohabati Mobarez A', 'Khoramabadi N', 'Mehdi Abdol M', 'Talebi Bezmin Abadi A']",2020,147,,Microb Pathog,"Papian S, et al.

32686895,Distinct Mechanisms for Processing Autophagy Protein LC3-PE by RavZ and ATG4B.,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process involved in the elimination of proteins, organelles and pathogens in eukaryotic cells. Lipidated LC3 proteins that are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) play a key role in autophagosome biogenesis. Endogenous ATG4-mediated deconjugation of LC3-PE is required for LC3 recycling. However, the Legionella effector RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3-PE to inhibit autophagy. It is not clear how ATG4 and RavZ process LC3-PE with distinct modes. Herein, a series of semisynthetic LC3-PE proteins containing C-terminal mutations or insertions were used to investigate the relationship of the C-terminal structure of LC3-PE with ATG4/RavZ-mediated deconjugation. Using a combination of molecular docking and biochemical assays, we found that Gln116, Phe119 and Gly120 of LC3-PE are required for cleavage by both RavZ and ATG4B, whereas Glu117(LC3) is specific to cleavage by RavZ. The molecular ruler mechanism exists in the active site of ATG4B, but not in RavZ. Met63 and Gln64 at the active site of RavZ are involved in accommodating LC3 C-terminal motif. Our findings show that the distinct binding modes of the LC3 C-terminal motif (116-120) with ATG4 and RavZ might determine the specificity of cleavage site.","['Yang A', 'Pantoom S', 'Wu YW']",2020,21,23,Chembiochem,"Yang A, et al.

Biofilm concentrations (BfC, measured as ATP) on copper were 3 (at 37 °C) to 6 (at 16 °C) times higher than on SS. The maximum colony counts of L. pneumophila on the materials tested at 37 °C showed a quadratic relationship with the associated BfCs, with highest values on copper and MS. The average Cu concentration on the glass control of copper (glass-copper) was more than two log units lower than the Fe concentration on glass-MS, suggesting that copper released less corrosion by-products than MS. The release of corrosion by-products with attached biomass from MS most likely enhanced biofilm formation on glass-MS.

32622269,Glucosylation by the Legionella Effector SetA Promotes the Nuclear Localization of the Transcription Factor TFEB.,"Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen that requires nutrients from the host for its replication. It has been shown that replicating L. pneumophila prefers amino acids as main sources of carbon and energy. The homeostasis of amino acids in eukaryotic cells is regulated by the transcription factor EB (TFEB), which translocates into the nucleus and activates genes for autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Here we show that the Legionella effector SetA causes a robust nuclear translocation of TFEB when exogenously expressed in mammalian cells and that the translocation is dependent on the glucosyltransferase activity of SetA. We further show that SetA directly glucosylates TFEB at multiple sites. Our findings of TFEB glucosylation by SetA may suggest an alternative strategy for exploiting host nutrients in addition to the control of host mTORC1 signaling by L. pneumophila. Our results provide further insight into the molecular mechanism of the delicate TFEB nuclear shuttling.","['Beck WHJ', 'Kim D', 'Das J', 'Yu H', 'Smolka MB', 'Mao Y']",2020,23,7,iScience,"Beck WHJ, et al.

METHODS: A retrospective case series of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR was analysed across two acute NHS hospitals (20 February-20 April 2020; each isolate reviewed independently in parallel). This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or Legionella urinary antigens and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643 (77%), 110 (13%), 249 (30%), 246 (29%) and 250 (30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection. Invasive fungal infections (n = 3) were attributed to line-related infections. Comparable rates of positive coinfection were identified in the control group of confirmed influenza infection; clinically relevant bacteraemias (2/141; 1.4%), respiratory cultures (10/38; 26.3%) and pneumococcal-positive antigens (1/19; 5.3%) were low.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a low frequency of bacterial coinfection in early COVID-19 hospital presentation, and no evidence of concomitant fungal infection, at least in the early phase of COVID-19.","['Hughes S', 'Troise O', 'Donaldson H', 'Mughal N', 'Moore LSP']",2020,26,10,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Hughes S, et al.

32590203,Required water temperature in hotel plumbing to control Legionella growth.,"Legionella spp. occurring in hotel hot water systems, in particular Legionella pneumophila, are causing serious pneumonic infections, and water temperature is a key factor to control their occurrence in plumbing systems. We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses of the available evidence on the association between water temperature and Legionella colonization to identify the water temperature in hotel hot water systems required for control of Legionella. Qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis were performed on 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria to identify the effect of temperature. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve identified 55 °C as a cutoff point for hotel hot water temperature with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.914. The odds ratios (OR) for detecting Legionella at temperatures >55 °C compared to lower temperatures from a meta-analysis of three studies was 0.17 [95% CI: 0.11, 0.25], which indicates a strong negative association between temperature and Legionella colonization. A logistic regression on results from multiple studies using both molecular and culture methods found a temperature of 59 °C associated with an 8% probability of detectable Legionella. Only two studies reported sufficiently detailed data to allow a model of concentration vs. temperature to be fit, and this model was not statistically significant. Additional research or more detailed reporting of existing datasets is required to assess if Legionella growth can be limited below particular concentration targets at different temperatures.","['Rasheduzzaman M', 'Singh R', 'Haas CN', 'Gurian PL']",2020,182,,Water Res,"Rasheduzzaman M, et al.

The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a DNA microarray assay for the simultaneous detection of fifteen bacterial species directly from respiratory tract specimens in patients with pneumonia. These species included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Legionella pneumophila and Chlamydia pneumoniae. The 16S rDNA genes and other specific genes of each pathogen were chosen as the amplification targets, amplified via multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and hybridized to oligonucleotide probes in a microarray.
RESULTS: The DNA microarray detection limit was 10
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a DNA microarray that could simultaneously detect various bacterial pathogens in pneumonia.

32574284,Clinical Characteristics of 5 COVID-19 Cases With Non-respiratory Symptoms as the First Manifestation in Children.,"An outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which then rapidly spread to more than 80 countries. However, detailed information on the characteristics of COVID-19 in children is still scarce. Five patients with non-respiratory symptoms as the first manifestation were hospitalized from the emergency department, and were later confirmed to have COVID-19, between 23 January and 20 February 2020, at the Wuhan Children's Hospital. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was positive for all the patients. Four of the patients were male and one was female, and their ages ranged from 2-months to 5.6 years. All lived in Wuhan. One patient had a clear history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, one had a suspected history of exposure, while the others had no exposure history. For three of the five patients, the primary onset disease required an emergency operation or treatment, and included intussusception, acute suppurative appendicitis perforation with local peritonitis, and traumatic subdural hemorrhage with convulsion, while for the other two it was acute gastroenteritis (including one patient with hydronephrosis and a stone in his left kidney). During the course of the disease, four of the five patients had a fever, whereas one case had no fever or cough. Two patients had leukopenia, and one also had lymphopenia. In the two cases of severe COVID-19, the levels of CRP, PCT, serum ferritin, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly increased, whereas the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and CD16 + CD56 natural killer cells were decreased. We also found impaired liver, kidney, and myocardial functions; the presence of hypoproteinemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia; and, in one case, abnormal coagulation function. Except for one patient who had a rotavirus infection, all patients tested negative for common pathogens, including the influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella. Chest CT images of all the patients showed patches or ground-glass opacities in the lung periphery or near the pleura, even large consolidations.

32567101,Identification and characterization of diverse OTU deubiquitinases in bacteria.,"Manipulation of host ubiquitin signaling is becoming an increasingly apparent evolutionary strategy among bacterial and viral pathogens. By removing host ubiquitin signals, for example, invading pathogens can inactivate immune response pathways and evade detection. The ovarian tumor (OTU) family of deubiquitinases regulates diverse ubiquitin signals in humans. Viral pathogens have also extensively co-opted the OTU fold to subvert host signaling, but the extent to which bacteria utilize the OTU fold was unknown. We have predicted and validated a set of OTU deubiquitinases encoded by several classes of pathogenic bacteria. Biochemical assays highlight the ubiquitin and polyubiquitin linkage specificities of these bacterial deubiquitinases. By determining the ubiquitin-bound structures of two examples, we demonstrate the novel strategies that have evolved to both thread an OTU fold and recognize a ubiquitin substrate. With these new examples, we perform the first cross-kingdom structural analysis of the OTU fold that highlights commonalities among distantly related OTU deubiquitinases.","['Schubert AF', 'Nguyen JV', 'Franklin TG', 'Geurink PP', 'Roberts CG', 'Sanderson DJ', 'Miller LN', 'Ovaa H', 'Hofmann K', 'Pruneda JN', 'Komander D']",2020,39,15,EMBO J,"Schubert AF, et al.

METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out with samples from 685 adults who were admitted with CAP and 108 non-CAP control patients. Atypical pathogens and respiratory viruses in serum were detected using the Pneumoslide IgM test from Vircell, Spain. All patients were divided into 6 groups according to age: 18-24, 25-44, 45-59, 60-74, 75-89, and >90.
RESULTS: The total positive rate of CAP was 35.4%, which was highest in the 18-24 age group (P < .05). The highest positive rate, 17.11%, was observed for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). The mean age of MP-infected patients was higher than that of the controls (P < .05). The positive rates for influenza B (INFB), Legionella pneumophila (LP1), Coxiella burnetii (COX), influenza A (INFA), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), and adenovirus (ADV) were 5.56%, 3.07%, 2.63%, 2.34%, 1.90%, 1.61, 0.88%, and 0.29%, respectively. There were 4.37% of patients with CAP having multiple infections. The main symptoms observed in the 685 CAP patients were cough and sputum production, in 78.4% and 67.4%. Fever was followed by 54% of CAP patients. Dyspnea (39.1%), anorexia (36.8%), increased thirst (26.7%), chills (18.7), headache (14.6%), and nausea (13.1%) were also frequently observed in the CAP patients.

METHODS: Multiple diagnostic methods were employed to diagnose atypical infections including culture, serology, and urinary antigen.
RESULTS: The microbiological intent-to-treat (MITT) population included 520 patients; 30% had an atypical bacterial pathogen identified (156/520). Overall, 13.1% (68/520) had a monomicrobial atypical infection and 2.3% (12/520) had polymicrobial all-atypical infections. Among patients with polymicrobial infections, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently occurring co-infecting organism and Chlamydia pneumoniae was the most frequently occurring co-infecting atypical organism. For Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, serology yielded the highest number of diagnoses. Delafloxacin and moxifloxacin had similar in vitro activity against M. pneumoniae and delafloxacin had greater activity against L. pneumophila. Two macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae isolates were recovered. No fluoroquinolone-resistant M. pneumoniae were isolated. The rates of microbiological success (documented or presumed eradication) at test-of-cure were similar between the delafloxacin and moxifloxacin groups. There was no evidence of a correlation between minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and outcome; a high proportion of favorable outcomes was observed across all delafloxacin baseline MICs.
CONCLUSIONS: Delafloxacin may be considered a treatment option as monotherapy for CABP in adults, where broad-spectrum coverage including atypical activity is desirable.","['McCurdy S', 'Nenninger A', 'Sheets A', 'Keedy K', 'Lawrence L', 'Quintas M', 'Cammarata S']",2020,97,,Int J Infect Dis,"McCurdy S, et al.

32517424,Current perspectives on atypical pneumonia in children.,"The major pathogens that cause atypical pneumonia are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae is common in children and presents as a relatively mild and self-limiting disease. CAP due to L. pneumophila is very rare in children and progresses rapidly, with fatal outcomes if not treated early. M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila have no cell walls; therefore, they do not respond to β-lactam antibiotics. Accordingly, macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones are the treatments of choice for atypical pneumonia. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics used in children because of their low minimum inhibitory concentrations and high safety. The incidence of pneumonia caused by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae that harbors point mutations has been increasing since 2000, particularly in Korea, Japan, and China. The marked increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MRMP) is partly attributed to the excessive use of macrolides. MRMP does not always lead to clinical nonresponsiveness to macrolides. Furthermore, severe complicated MRMP responds to corticosteroids without requiring a change in antibiotic. This implies that the hyper-inflammatory status of the host can induce clinically refractory pneumonia regardless of mutation. Empirical macrolide therapy in children with mild to moderate CAP, particularly during periods without M. pneumoniae epidemics, may not provide additional benefits over β-lactam monotherapy and can increase the risk of MRMP.",['Shim JY'],2020,63,12,Clin Exp Pediatr,Shim JY.

32513920,Mechanism of effector capture and delivery by the type IV secretion system from Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is a bacterial pathogen that utilises a Type IV secretion (T4S) system to inject effector proteins into human macrophages. Essential to the recruitment and delivery of effectors to the T4S machinery is the membrane-embedded T4 coupling complex (T4CC). Here, we purify an intact T4CC from the Legionella membrane. It contains the DotL ATPase, the DotM and DotN proteins, the chaperone module IcmSW, and two previously uncharacterised proteins, DotY and DotZ. The atomic resolution structure reveals a DotLMNYZ hetero-pentameric core from which the flexible IcmSW module protrudes. Six of these hetero-pentameric complexes may assemble into a 1.6-MDa hexameric nanomachine, forming an inner membrane channel for effectors to pass through. Analysis of multiple cryo EM maps, further modelling and mutagenesis provide working models for the mechanism for binding and delivery of two essential classes of Legionella effectors, depending on IcmSW or DotM, respectively.","['Meir A', 'Macé K', 'Lukoyanova N', 'Chetrit D', 'Hospenthal MK', 'Redzej A', 'Roy C', 'Waksman G']",2020,11,1,Nat Commun,"Meir A, et al.

32499557,Identification of two aptamers binding to Legionella pneumophila with high affinity and specificity.,"Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is a water borne bacterium causing Legionnaires' Disease (LD) in humans. Rapid detection of Lp in water system is essential to reduce the risk of LD outbreaks. The methods currently available require expert skills and are time intensive, thus delaying intervention. In situ detection of Lp by biosensor would allow rapid implementation of control strategies. To this end, a biorecognition element is required. Aptamers are considered promising biorecognition molecules for biosensing. Aptamers are short oligonucleotide sequence folding into a specific structure and are able to bind to specific molecules. Currently, no aptamer and thus no aptamer-based technology exists for the detection of Lp. In this study, Systemic Evolution of Ligands through EXponential enrichment (SELEX) was used to identify aptamers binding specifically to Lp. Ten rounds of positive selection and two rounds of counter-selection against two Pseudomonas species were performed.

32498831,Highly sensitive and fast Legionella spp. in situ detection based on a loop mediated isothermal amplification technique combined to an electrochemical transduction system.,"A rapid highly sensitive genosensor has been developed for monitoring the presence of Legionella spp. in different water systems (domestic hot water, heating/cooling systems or cooling towers) in order to avoid its spreading from the source of contamination. The genosensor integrates a loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction with an electrochemical transduction signal, producing a very simple, rapid to perform and cost effective method, suitable for in situ analyses. This approach detects as low as 10 fg of Legionella nucleic acid, corresponding to only 2 number copies of the bacteria. The use of an electrochemical redox-active double stranded DNA (dsDNA) intercalating molecule, known as methylen blue (MB), allows the immediate electrochemical reading during the DNA polymerization. The sensor can obtain quantitative results in 20 min with a correlation between the electrochemical data and Legionella spp. copy number (at a logarithmic scale) of r = -0.97. In conclusion, a fast, easy to use, and accurate electrochemical genosensor, with high precision, sensitivity, and specificity has been developed for in situ detection of Legionella spp. enabling real time decision making and improving significantly the current detection methods for the prevention and screening of Legionella.","['Olabarria G', 'Eletxigerra U', 'Rodriguez I', 'Bilbao A', 'Berganza J', 'Merino S']",2020,217,,Talanta,"Olabarria G, et al.

32472821,"Legionnaires' Disease in Pediatric Patients, Control Measures and 5-Year Follow-up.","BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease (LD) occurs predominantly in adults and elderly people. Its incidence in Europe has been increasing in recent years. It is rare in younger age groups and prone to be reported as healthcare-associated infection with a higher risk of fatal outcome. Hospital-acquired LD is mostly associated with a colonized hospital water system. We describe 5 LD cases in a children's hospital in Slovakia, subsequent environmental investigation, control measures, and 5-year monitoring of Legionella colonization in hospital's water system.
METHODS: In 2014-2019, we tested clinical specimens from 75 hospitalized patients. Respiratory samples were cultured for Legionella, patient's urine was tested for Legionella urinary antigens, and the microagglutination test was used for serologic testing. Samples of water were collected in 2015-2019 and processed according ISO11731.
RESULTS: We identified 5 Legionella infections in 2014-2015. Median age of patients was 15 years. All were high-risk patients hospitalized for their underlying diseases. All patients required admission to intensive care unit, and artificial ventilation due to general deterioration and respiratory failure. Legionella pneumophila was isolated from 72% of water samples. Chlorine dioxide dosing into water system above 0.3 ppm caused significant decrease of Legionella concentration in water samples. Samples taken from outlets with antimicrobial filter installed were legionellae-negative.
CONCLUSIONS: Control measures led to decreased risk of infection, but not to eradication of Legionellae. It is necessary to extend the diagnostics for Legionella infection in hospitalized children with pneumonia, especially in hospitals with colonized water system.","['Fulová M', 'Kotrbancová M', 'Bražinová A', 'Boledovičová J', 'Trnková K', 'Špaleková M']",2020,39,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Fulová M, et al.

32457311,Structural basis for effector protein recognition by the Dot/Icm Type IVB coupling protein complex.,"The Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4BSS) is extremely versatile, translocating ~300 effector proteins into host cells. This specialized secretion system employs the Dot/Icm type IVB coupling protein (T4CP) complex, which includes IcmS, IcmW and LvgA, that are known to selectively assist the export of a subclass of effectors. Herein, the crystal structure of a four-subunit T4CP subcomplex bound to the effector protein VpdB reveals an interaction between LvgA and a linear motif in the C-terminus of VpdB. The same binding interface of LvgA also interacts with the C-terminal region of three additional effectors, SidH, SetA and PieA. Mutational analyses identified a FxxxLxxxK binding motif that is shared by VpdB and SidH, but not by SetA and PieA, showing that LvgA recognizes more than one type of binding motif. Together, this work provides a structural basis for how the Dot/Icm T4CP complex recognizes effectors, and highlights the multiple substrate-binding specificities of its adaptor subunit.","['Kim H', 'Kubori T', 'Yamazaki K', 'Kwak MJ', 'Park SY', 'Nagai H', 'Vogel JP', 'Oh BH']",2020,11,1,Nat Commun,"Kim H, et al.

32451737,Legionella pneumophila Attachment to Biofilms of an Acidovorax Isolate from a Drinking Water-Consortium Requires the Lcl-Adhesin Protein.,"Human infection by Legionella pneumophila (Lpn) only occurs via contaminated water from man-made sources, and eradication of these bacteria from man-made water systems is complicated by biofilm colonization. Using a continuously fed biofilm reactor model, we grew a biofilm consortium from potable water that was able to prolong recovery of Lpn CFU from biofilms. This effect was recreated using a subset of those species in a simplified consortium composed of eight bacterial isolates from the first biofilm reactor. In the reactor with the eight-species consortium, Lpn biofilm CFU was relatively stable over a 12-day trial. An isolate of Acidovorax from the consortium was, as a single species biofilm, able to promote Lpn surface attachment. Other isolates from the Pelomonas genus grew as equally robust biofilms alone, but did not promote surface attachment of Lpn. This attachment was disrupted by cationic polysaccharides and loss of the Lpn Lcl collagen-like adhesin protein. This work demonstrates that, while Lpn was fairly incompetent at attachment to surfaces to form a biofilm alone, pre-existing biofilms allowed attachment of Lpn as secondary colonizers. In addition, we demonstrate that initial attachment of Lpn to Acidovorax biofilms is likely via the Lcl-adhesin protein.","['Chatfield CH', 'Zaia J', 'Sauer C']",2020,23,4,Int Microbiol,"Chatfield CH, et al.

FLAs and bacteria were isolated from mussel extracts and from natural water. PCR techniques were used to identify the FLAs and endosymbiont bacteria (Legionella, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas and cyanobacteria), and to detect Giardia and Cryptosporidium. The most frequently found FLAs were Naegleria spp. The presence of Legionella, Mycobacterium and Pseudomonas inside the FLA was demonstrated, and in some cases both Legionella and Pseudomonas were found together. Differences between FLAs and ARB identified inside the mussels and in the water were detected. In addition, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus spp. were accumulated in mussels in concentrations unconnected with those found in water. The results show the ability of the zebra mussel to act as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic FLAs, which are associated with potentially pathogenic ARB, although the lack of association between microorganisms inside the mussels and in the water suggests that they are not useful for monitoring microbiological contamination at a specific time.","['Goñi P', 'Benito M', 'LaPlante D', 'Fernández MT', 'Sánchez E', 'Chueca P', 'Miguel N', 'Mosteo R', 'Ormad MP', 'Rubio E']",2020,22,8,Environ Microbiol,"Goñi P, et al.

Vaccination may be an effective method for preventing L.pneumophila infection. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a better vaccine against this disease. In this study, we developed a recombinant peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL)/type IV pilin (PilE)/lagellin (FlaA) DNA vaccine and evaluated its immunogenicity and efficacy to protect against L.pneumophila infection.
RESULTS: According to the results, the expression of PAL, PilE, FlaA proteins and PAL/PilE/FlaA fusion protein in 293 cells was confirmed. Immunization with PAL/PilE/FlaA DNA vaccine resulted in highest IgG titer and strongest cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. Furthermore, the histopathological changes in lung tissues of mice challenged with a lethal dose of L.pneumophila were alleviated by PAL/PilE/FlaA DNA vaccine immunization. The production of T-helper-1 (Th1) cytokines (IFNγ, TGF-α, and IL-12), and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were promoted in PAL/PilE/FlaA DNA vaccine group. Finally, immunization with PAL/PilE/FlaA vaccine raised the survival rate of mice to 100% after challenging with a lethal dose of L.pneumophila for 10 consecutive days.

32389709,Prevention of nosocomial legionellosis by best water management: comparison of three decontamination methods.,"BACKGROUND: Since 2000, the National Health System has adopted international guidelines for assessing Legionella spp. in hospital water systems. The control of water contamination by Legionella spp. is still a matter of research concerning the most effective method in preventing nosocomial infections.
AIM: To compare three different decontamination methods by monitoring colony-forming unit count and number of hospital-acquired legionellosis cases. A secondary objective was to evaluate the long-term effects of the preventive measures on the water pipes.
METHODS: A protocol was developed for the selection of high-risk sampling sites and for the testing of three disinfection methods over the course of 19 years: hyperchlorination and thermal shock (period A, 2000-2005); copper-silver ionization (period B, 2006-2010); and integration of pre-filtering, filtering, pipe-protecting products, and remote control with chlorine dioxide (ClO
FINDINGS: The use of shock disinfection and hyperchlorination led to a decrease in contamination level immediately after the procedure, but then it rose again to the previous level in two months. Both copper-silver ionization and ClO

Previous studies have investigated the associations between LD incidence and meteorological factors, but the Belgian data remained unexplored. We investigated data collected between 2011 and 2019. Daily exposure data on temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and wind speed was obtained from the Royal Meteorological Institute for 29 weather stations. Case data were collected from the national reference centre and through mandatory notification. Daily case and exposure data were aggregated by province. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study. The 'at risk' period was defined as 10 to 2 days prior to disease onset. The corresponding days in the other study years were selected as referents. We fitted separate conditional Poisson models for each day in the 'at risk' period and a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) which fitted all data in one model. LD incidence showed a yearly peak in August and September. A total of 614 cases were included. Given seasonality, a sequence of precipitation, followed by high relative humidity and low wind speed showed a statistically significant association with the number of cases 6 to 4 days later. We discussed the advantages of DLNM in this context.","['Braeye T', 'Echahidi F', 'Meghraoui A', 'Laisnez V', 'Hens N']",2020,148,,Epidemiol Infect,"Braeye T, et al.

32331667,Microbiota and volatilome profile of fresh and chill-stored deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris).,"Bacterial communities and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) profile of deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) stored at 0 °C (ice) and 4 °C were investigated using 16S amplicon based sequencing and Solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) - Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), respectively. The shelf-life of shrimps determined by sensory assessment was 5 and 2 days at 0 °C and 4 °C, respectively. Based on 16S analysis (culture-independed), the initial microbiota of shrimps mainly consists of Photobacterium, Candidatus Hepatoplasma, Psychrobacter, Acinetobacter and Delftia. Psychrobacter and Carnobacterium dominated during storage at both temperatures. Psychrobacter was the most dominant taxon at the end of shelf-life of chill-stored shrimps. A minor microbial population composed by Brevundimonas, Stenotrophomonas, Staphylococcus, Legionella, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella was also detected. Those taxa may be originated from the environment due to an inadequate hygienic practice during fishing, handling and icing. VOCs such as ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, indole etc., were found to be associated with shrimps at 4 °C, while acetone and dimethyl sulfide with shrimps in ice. Some VOCs, from microbial or chemical origin, increased in shrimps either at 0 °C (i.e. 1-octen-3-ol, trans-2-octenal) or at 4 °C (i.e. 3-methyl-1-butanol, indole), while 2-methylbutanal and 3-methylbutanal increased in both temperatures. A positive correlation between Psychrobacter with 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and Carnobacterium with 3-methyl-1-butanol was also observed. Concluding, we suggest the reinforcement of Good Hygiene Practices on fishing boats during fishing/handling, the rapid onboard icing and keeping shrimps iced avoiding even small increase of storage temperature that affects quality parameters (e.g. microbial population level, synthesis of microbiota, VOCs profile) in order to provide a product of the highest quality and safety in the market.","['Parlapani FF', 'Ferrocino I', 'Michailidou S', 'Argiriou A', 'Haroutounian SA', 'Kokokiris L', 'Rantsiou K', 'Boziaris IS']",2020,132,,Food Res Int,"Parlapani FF, et al.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends either a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide as a first-line antibiotic treatment for Legionella pneumonia, but it is unclear which antibiotic leads to optimal clinical outcomes. We compared the effectiveness of fluoroquinolone versus macrolide monotherapy in Legionella pneumonia using a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of literature in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to 1 June 2019. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing macrolide with fluoroquinolone monotherapy using clinical outcomes in patients with Legionella pneumonia were included. Twenty-one publications out of an initial 2073 unique records met the selection criteria. Following PRISMA guidelines, 2 reviewers participated in data extraction. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical cure, time to apyrexia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and the occurrence of complications. The review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019132901).
RESULTS: Twenty-one publications with 3525 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age of the population was 60.9 years and 67.2% were men. The mortality rate for patients treated with fluoroquinolones was 6.9% (104/1512) compared with 7.4% (133/1790) among those treated with macrolides. The pooled odds ratio assessing risk of mortality for patients treated with fluoroquinolones versus macrolides was 0.94 (95% confidence interval, .71-1.25, I2 = 0%, P = .661). Clinical cure, time to apyrexia, LOS, and the occurrence of complications did not differ for patients treated with fluoroquinolones versus macrolides.

The price of poor design, construction, usage and maintenance of modern water/sanitation services.","Classical waterborne pathogens (cholera/typhoid) drove the development of safe water and sanitation during the industrial revolution. Whilst effective against these organisms, other bacteria exploited the potential to form biofilm in the narrow pipes of buildings. 1976 saw the discovery of legionella. Despite evidence dating back to 1967 (including paediatric deaths in Manchester in 1995 from splashes from a sink contaminating parenteral nutrition) it required the deaths of four neonates and the might of the Press in 2011 for the UK medical services to accept waterborne transmission of other Opportunistic Plumbing Premise Pathogens (OPPP). Human nature, a healthcare construction industry largely devoid of interest in water safety, and failures in recognising transmission are major forces hindering progress in preventing infection/deaths from waterborne infections. The advent of highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria is highlighting further deficiencies in modern drainage systems. These bacteria are not thought to have special adaptations promoting their dispersal but purely attract our attention to the well-trodden routes used by sensitive organisms, which go undetected. The O'Neill report warns of the bleak future without effective antibiotics.

We have recently solved the structure of the Dot/Icm apparatus by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and showed that it forms a cell envelope-spanning channel that connects to a cytoplasmic complex. Applying two complementary approaches that preserve the native structure of the specimen, fluorescent microscopy in living cells and cryo-ET, allows in situ visualization of proteins and assimilation of the stoichiometry and timing of production of each machine component relative to other Dot/Icm subunits. To investigate the requirements for polar positioning and to characterize dynamic features associated with T4SS machine biogenesis, we have fused a gene encoding superfolder green fluorescent protein to Dot/Icm ATPase genes at their native positions on the chromosome. The following method integrates quantitative fluorescence microscopy of living cells and cryo-ET to quantify polar localization, dynamics, and structure of these proteins in intact bacterial cells. Applying these approaches for studying the Legionella pneumophila T4SS is useful for characterizing the function of the Dot/Icm system and can be adapted to study a wide variety of bacterial pathogens that utilize the T4SS or other types of bacterial secretion complexes.","['Chetrit D', 'Park D', 'Hu B', 'Liu J', 'Roy CR']",2020,,157,J Vis Exp,"Chetrit D, et al.

32220647,Paradoxical Pro-inflammatory Responses by Human Macrophages to an Amoebae Host-Adapted Legionella Effector.,"Legionella pneumophila has co-evolved with amoebae, their natural hosts. Upon transmission to humans, the bacteria proliferate within alveolar macrophages causing pneumonia. Here, we show L. pneumophila injects the effector LamA, an amylase, into the cytosol of human macrophage (hMDMs) and amoebae to rapidly degrade glycogen to generate cytosolic hyper-glucose. In response, hMDMs shift their metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, which directly triggers an M1-like pro-inflammatory differentiation and nutritional innate immunity through enhanced tryptophan degradation. This leads to a modest restriction of bacterial proliferation in hMDMs. In contrast, LamA-mediated glycogenolysis in amoebae deprives the natural host from the main building blocks for synthesis of the cellulose-rich cyst wall, leading to subversion of amoeba encystation. This is non-permissive for bacterial proliferation. Therefore, LamA of L. pneumophila is an amoebae host-adapted effector that subverts encystation of the amoebae natural host, and the paradoxical hMDMs' pro-inflammatory response is likely an evolutionary accident.","['Price C', 'Jones S', 'Mihelcic M', 'Santic M', 'Abu Kwaik Y']",2020,27,4,Cell Host Microbe,"Price C, et al.

32218409,Asymptomatic cardiac and gallbladder involvement at initial presentation of Legionnaires' disease.,"UNLABELLED: Extrapulmonary manifestations of Legionnaires' disease (LD) include, inter alia cardiac, brain, abdominal, joints and skin involvement.
A CASE REPORT: The authors describe a case of a 41-year-old immunocompetent female admitted due to a high fever, chills and fatigue. She negated cough and chest or abdominal pain. Initial chest X-ray was normal. Among laboratory abnormalities were: elevation of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, transaminases and creatinine, hyponatremia, low white blood cell and platelet count and a moderate proteinuria. ECG showed subtle ST elevation. Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular (LV) contractility and near normal longitudinal strain, mild myocardial thickening, and a small pericardial effusion; additionally, in subcostal view, gallbladder wall thickening (GBWT) was found. Positive L. pneumophila urinary antigen test confirmed LD diagnosis. Control Xray and CT showed development of pleural effusion and bilateral pulmonary infiltrations. Clinical and radiologic improvement of the disease was achieved with ciprofloxacin therapy started from admission. ECG abnormalities persisted for only 5 days, GBWT resolved after 9 days, pericardial effusion disappeared after 10 days; normalization of LV thickness and an increase in longitudinal strain was found within 2 weeks. However, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) performed after a month revealed focal midmyocardial and linear subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors underline the fact that being aware of extrapulmonary LD, also silent, may allow to diagnose the disease, especially when pulmonary involvement is initially absent.","['Elikowski W', 'Małek-Elikowska M', 'Ganowicz-Kaatz T', 'Fertała N', 'Zawodna M', 'Pyda M']",2020,48,283,Pol Merkur Lekarski,"Elikowski W, et al.

32214051,Water Management for Construction: Evidence for Risk Characterization in Community and Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review.,"Construction activities are a known risk contributing to the growth and spread of waterborne pathogens in building water systems. The purpose of the study is to integrate evidence for categorizing construction activity risk factors contributing to waterborne disease in community and healthcare settings, establish severity of such risk factors and identify knowledge gaps. Using a systematic review, the inclusion criteria were: 1) studies with disease cases suspected to be associated with construction activities and waterborne pathogens, and 2) active construction work described in a community or healthcare setting. Each construction activity risk factor was correlated across all studies with the number of disease cases and deaths to establish risk severity. The eligibility review and quantitative synthesis yielded 31 studies for inclusion (community, n = 7 and healthcare, n = 24). From 1965 to 2016, a total of 894 disease cases inclusive of 112 deaths were associated with nine construction activity risk factors and waterborne pathogens. The present study findings support the need for building owners, water management teams and public health professionals to address construction activity risk factors and the analysis of current knowledge deficiencies within the scope of an ongoing water management program. The impact of construction activities on waterborne disease is preventable and should no longer be considered incidental nor accidental.","['Scanlon MM', 'Gordon JL', 'McCoy WF', 'Cain MF']",2020,17,6,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Scanlon MM, et al.

32188994,High-polyphenol extracts from Sorghum bicolor attenuate replication of Legionella pneumophila within RAW 264.7 macrophages.,"Polyphenols derived from a variety of plants have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against diverse microbial pathogens. Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that opportunistically causes a severe inflammatory pneumonia in humans, called Legionnaires' Disease, via replication within macrophages. Previous studies demonstrated that tea polyphenols attenuate L. pneumophila intracellular replication within mouse macrophages via increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Sorghum bicolor is a sustainable cereal crop that thrives in arid environments and is well-suited to continued production in warming climates. Sorghum polyphenols have anticancer and antioxidant properties, but their antimicrobial activity has not been evaluated. Here, we investigated the impact of sorghum polyphenols on L. pneumophila intracellular replication within RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Sorghum high-polyphenol extract (HPE) attenuated L. pneumophila intracellular replication in a dose-dependent manner but did not impair either bacterial replication in rich media or macrophage viability. Moreover, HPE treatment enhanced both TNF and IL-6 secretion from L. pneumophila infected macrophages. Thus, polyphenols derived from sorghum enhance macrophage restriction of L. pneumophila, likely via increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This work reveals commonalities between plant polyphenol-mediated antimicrobial activity and provides a foundation for future evaluation of sorghum as an antimicrobial agent.","['Gilchrist AK', 'Smolensky D', 'Ngwaga T', 'Chauhan D', 'Cox S', 'Perumal R', 'Noronha LE', 'Shames SR']",2020,367,7,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Gilchrist AK, et al.

32176798,Blind Spots of Traditional Microbiological Tests for Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults and Availability of Nonculture Techniques: A Nationwide Survey of Physicians in China.,"BACKGROUND: In China, no national survey has been conducted to evaluate physicians' attitudes and compliance with guidelines in the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate physicians' awareness of the use of microbiological tests in the management of severe CAP (SCAP) and to investigate the availability of nonculture tests in China.
METHODS: A nationwide electronic questionnaire survey was conducted among Chinese physicians between March and July 2018, which assessed their viewpoints concerning the issues in the management of SCAP.
RESULTS: A total of 6333 physicians completed this survey, evenly covering all career stages. Among these, 3208 (50.6%) and 1936 (30.6%) had blind spots in the application of blood and sputum cultures in the management of SCAP, respectively. Nonteaching hospital, nonrespirologists, and junior career stage were independently associated with misunderstandings. Regarding nonculture methods, 52.7% of the facilities had no access to polymerase chain reaction-based pathogen detection tests. The accessibility of urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae (42.5%) and Legionella pneumophila (38.5%) was also low. The main barriers were inland and remote region, lower hospital level, and nonteaching hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient use of sputum and blood cultures, together with low accessibility of major nonculture techniques, were noticeable barriers to achieving microbiological diagnosis of SCAP in China. To help curb the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further measures should be taken to raise awareness among nonspecialists and promote rapid nonculture tests, especially in nonteaching hospitals and developing regions.","['Zhang J', 'Hu W', 'Huang Y', 'Qu J', 'Infection Assembly of the Chinese Thoracic Society']",2020,221,Suppl 2,J Infect Dis,"Zhang J, et al.

While a confirmed and fast ARTI diagnosis is key for antibiotic prescribing, empiric antimicrobial treatment remains common, because viral symptoms are often clinically similar and difficult to distinguish from those caused by bacteria. As a result, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions are high and in certain settings likely higher than the commonly estimated 30%. The QIAstat Respiratory Panel® assay (QIAstat RP) is a multiplexed in vitro diagnostics test for the rapid simultaneous detection of 21 pathogens directly from respiratory samples, including human mastadenovirus A-G, primate bocaparvovirus 1+2, human coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, OC43, 229E), human metapneumovirus A/B, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A virus (no subtype, subtype H1, H1N1/2009, H3), influenza B virus, human respirovirus 1+3, human orthorubulavirus 2+4, human orthopneumovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. We describe the first multicenter study of 445 respiratory samples, collected through the 2016-2017 and 2018 respiratory seasons, with performance compared against BioFire FilmArray RP v1.7 and discrepancy testing by Seegene Allplex RP.

Therefore molecular surveillance activities based on pathogen subtyping are an important measure of controlling Salmonellosis by public health agencies. In Germany, at the federal level, this work is carried out by the National Reference Center for Salmonella and other Bacterial Enteric Pathogens (NRC). With rise of next generation sequencing techniques, the NRC has introduced whole-genome-based typing methods for S. enterica in 2016. In this study we report on the feasibility of genome-based in silico serotyping in the German setting using raw sequence reads. We found that SeqSero and seven gene MLST showed 98% and 95% concordance, respectively, with classical serotyping for the here evaluated serotypes, including the most common German serotypes S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium as well as less frequently found serotypes. The level of concordance increased to >99% when the results of both in silico methods were combined. However, both tools exhibited misidentification of monophasic variants, in particular monophasic S. Typhimurium and therefore need to be fine-tuned for reliable detection of this epidemiologically important variant.

32147537,Persistent Legionella contamination of water faucets in a tertiary hospital in Japan.,"OBJECTIVE: The feasibility of the decontamination procedure for Legionella pneumophila of water systems in healthcare facilities varies by water purification and disinfection methods in each country. We evaluated the efficacy of feasible decontamination strategies in Japan.
METHODS: This study was conducted at Tokyo Medical University Hospital (1015 beds) between 2015 and 2018. Samples from the water system and cooling tower were cultured periodically. Hyper-chlorination of cool tap water (>0.2 ppm), increases in the temperature of hot water (>55 °C), and flushing were used as decontamination strategies. The case of healthcare-associated legionellosis was surveyed. Environmental and clinical isolates were genotyped.
RESULTS: 1439 environmental samples were collected; 19 (1.3%) samples tested positive for L. pneumophila from water faucets of patient rooms, toilets, waste rooms, and water sourced from wells. Genotyping of 12 isolates confirmed that the same strains were present in eight environmental isolates and two isolates from patients over three years. Although the environmental contamination of the water system was persistent, the number of positive locations of hospital environments gradually decreased; eight in 2015, four in 2016, three in 2017, and four in 2018, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring contamination, hyper-chlorination, controlling temperature, and flushing were effective as a Legionella decontamination strategy.","['Nakamura I', 'Amemura-Maekawa J', 'Kura F', 'Kobayashi T', 'Sato A', 'Watanabe H', 'Matsumoto T']",2020,93,,Int J Infect Dis,"Nakamura I, et al.

32133999,"The phospholipase A effector PlaA from Legionella pneumophila: expression, purification and crystallization.","Legionella pneumophila encodes an extracellular secreted phospholipase A named PlaA that is translocated by the type II secretion system. It plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of Legionella-containing vacuoles in L. pneumophila pathogenesis.

Due to the high environmental prevalence of Acanthamoeba. in the Castilian Plateau (Spain), the aims of this work were to investigate the occurrence of Acanthamoeba and other FLA in water from several sampling points from four Drinking Water Treatment Plants (DWTP) and to investigate the presence of Legionella spp. and other amoeba-resisting bacteria in biofilms in raw and finished water, taking into account that no legislation exists for this protozoa control. Acanthamoeba was detected at different sampling points, and sand filters seemed to contribute to amoebic enrichment. After ozonation, a temporary decrease in viable amoebae was observed. The genotypes detected were T3, T4, and T5, revealing the first report of genotype T5 in waters from this region. Moreover, Balamuthia mandrillaris, Vermamoeba vermiformis and Paravahlkampfia sp. were detected. Regarding Legionella, PCR detection in raw and finished water was higher than by agar culture, but even higher after Acanthamoeba co-culture. Also, Legionella's presence was higher in raw water than in finished water. The decrease of free Legionella observed from raw (27.5%, by PCR) to finished water (3.4% by PCR) contrasted with the increase of Legionella-infected FLA from raw (30.7%) to finished water (52%). At biofilm, free Legionella was not detected, and the percentage of infected FLA was low (3.8%). Legionella species identified in these samples were L. drozanskii, L. donaldsonii and L. feeleii. Additionally, Acanthamoeba co-culture led to the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, P. fluorecens, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The highly disseminated presence of Acanthamoeba and the detection of amoeba-resisting bacteria inside amoebae highlight the importance of developing methods for controlling FLA in order to limit human pathogenic amoeba-resisting bacteria survival to the water purification processes.","['Gomes TS', 'Vaccaro L', 'Magnet A', 'Izquierdo F', 'Ollero D', 'Martínez-Fernández C', 'Mayo L', 'Moran M', 'Pozuelo MJ', 'Fenoy S', 'Hurtado C', 'Del Águila C']",2020,719,,Sci Total Environ,"Gomes TS, et al.

32106217,"Fatal Case of Legionnaires' Disease After Home Exposure to Legionella pneumophila Serogroup 3 - Wisconsin, 2018.","In January 2018, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Division of Public Health (DPH), received a report of a culture-confirmed case of Legionnaires' disease. The patient, who was immunocompromised, had died at a local hospital 10 days after being admitted. DPH and an infection preventionist from the hospital investigated to determine the source of the infection and prevent additional cases. Because the case was suspected to be nosocomial, health care facility water samples were tested for Legionella. When these samples were negative, water sources in the patient's home were tested. These tested positive for Legionella pneumophila, and the bacteria remained after an attempt to remediate. The patient and home isolates were identified as L. pneumophila serogroup 3, sequence type 93, by whole-genome multilocus sequence typing. A second resident of the home did not become ill. This case highlights the potential for immunocompromised persons and others at risk for Legionnaires' disease to be exposed to Legionella through home water systems containing the bacteria and demonstrates the difficulty of home remediation. This case also illustrates the role of lower respiratory tract specimens in the identification of less common Legionella infections (e.g., L. pneumophila serogroup 3) and confirmation of the infection source.","['Schumacher A', 'Kocharian A', 'Koch A', 'Marx J']",2020,69,8,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Schumacher A, et al.

32096265,Components of the endocytic and recycling trafficking pathways interfere with the integrity of the Legionella-containing vacuole.,"Legionella pneumophila requires the Dot/Icm translocation system to replicate in a vacuolar compartment within host cells. Strains lacking the translocated substrate SdhA form a permeable vacuole during residence in the host cell, exposing bacteria to the host cytoplasm. In primary macrophages, mutants are defective for intracellular growth, with a pyroptotic cell death response mounted due to bacterial exposure to the cytosol. To understand how SdhA maintains vacuole integrity during intracellular growth, we performed high-throughput RNAi screens against host membrane trafficking genes to identify factors that antagonise vacuole integrity in the absence of SdhA. Depletion of host proteins involved in endocytic uptake and recycling resulted in enhanced intracellular growth and lower levels of permeable vacuoles surrounding the ΔsdhA mutant. Of interest were three different Rab GTPases involved in these processes: Rab11b, Rab8b and Rab5 isoforms, that when depleted resulted in enhanced vacuole integrity surrounding the sdhA mutant. Proteins regulated by these Rabs are responsible for interfering with proper vacuole membrane maintenance, as depletion of the downstream effectors EEA1, Rab11FIP1, or VAMP3 rescued vacuole integrity and intracellular growth of the sdhA mutant. To test the model that specific vesicular components associated with these effectors could act to destabilise the replication vacuole, EEA1 and Rab11FIP1 showed increased density about the sdhA mutant vacuole compared with the wild type (WT) vacuole. Depletion of Rab5 isoforms or Rab11b reduced this aberrant redistribution. These findings are consistent with SdhA interfering with both endocytic and recycling membrane trafficking events that act to destabilise vacuole integrity during infection.","['Anand IS', 'Choi W', 'Isberg RR']",2020,22,4,Cell Microbiol,"Anand IS, et al.

32088542,Effect of disinfectant residuals on infection risks from Legionella pneumophila released by biofilms grown under simulated premise plumbing conditions.,"The ubiquitous presence of biofilms in premise plumbing and stagnation, which commonly occurs in premise plumbing, can exacerbate the decay of chlorine residual in drinking water. Using biofilms grown in a simulated premise plumbing setup fed directly with freshly treated water at two full-scale water treatment plants, we previously determined the mass transfer coefficients for chlorine decay in premise plumbing. These coefficients coupled with inactivation kinetics of L. pneumophila released from biofilms reported previously were integrated into a Monte Carlo framework to estimate the infection risk of biofilm-derived L. pneumophila from 1 to 48 h of stagnation. The annual infection risk was significantly higher when water stayed stagnant for up to 48 h in pipes covered internally with biofilms, compared to clean pipes without biofilms. The decay of residual chlorine due to biofilms during 48-hour stagnation led to up to 6 times increase in the annual infection risk compared to the case where biofilms was absent. Global sensitivity analysis revealed that the rate of L. pneumophila detachment from biofilms and the decay of chlorine residual during stagnation are the two most important factors influencing the infection risks. Stagnation caused by water use patterns and water-saving devices in the premise plumbing can lead to increased infection risk by biofilm-derived L. pneumophila. Overall, this study's findings suggested that biofilms could induce chlorine decay and consequently increase L. pneumophila infection risk. Thus, reducing stagnation, maintaining residual chlorine, and suppressing biofilm growth could contribute to better management of L. pneumophila infection risk.","['Huang C', 'Shen Y', 'Smith RL', 'Dong S', 'Nguyen TH']",2020,137,,Environ Int,"Huang C, et al.

32081644,Distribution of Legionella species and serogroups in patients with culture-confirmed Legionella pneumonia.,"Legionella species are consistently identified as some of the most common causative agents of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or nosocomial pneumonia. Although the number of reported Legionella infection cases is gradually increasing in Japan, most cases are diagnosed by a urinary antigen test, which identifies only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Therefore, assessment of pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroups would be important. The Japan Society for Chemotherapy Legionella committee has collected the isolates and clinical information on cases of sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia throughout Japan. Between December 2006 and March 2019, totally 140 sporadic cases were identified, in which L. pneumophila was the most frequently isolated species (90.7%) followed by L. bozemanae (3.6%), L. dumofii (3.6%), L. micdadei (1.4%), and L. longbeachae (0.7%). Among 127 isolates of L. pneumophila, 111 isolates were of serogroup 1, two of serogroup 2, four of serogroup 3, one of serogroup 4, one of serogroup 5, seven of serogroup 6, and one was of serogroup 10. We also assessed in vitro activity of antibiotics against these isolates and showed that quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-Legionella activity. Our study showed that pneumonia-causing Legionella species and serogroup distribution was comparable to that reported in former surveillances. L. pneumophila was the most common etiologic agent in patients with community-acquired Legionella pneumonia, and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was the predominant serogroup.","['Miyashita N', 'Higa F', 'Aoki Y', 'Kikuchi T', 'Seki M', 'Tateda K', 'Maki N', 'Uchino K', 'Ogasawara K', 'Kiyota H', 'Watanabe A']",2020,26,5,J Infect Chemother,"Miyashita N, et al.

32070446,Applying probability-weighted incubation period distributions to traditional wind rose methodology to improve public health investigations of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks.,"In the event of a Legionnaires' disease outbreak, rapid location and control of the source of bacteria are crucial for outbreak management and regulation. In this paper, we describe an enhancement of the traditional wind rose for epidemiological use; shifting the focus of measurement from relative frequency of the winds speeds and directions to the relative volume of air carried, whilst also incorporating probability distributions of disease incubation periods to refine identification of the important wind directions during a cases window of exposure, i.e. from which direction contaminated aerosols most likely originated. The probability-weighted wind rose offers a potential improvement over the traditional wind rose by weighting the importance of wind measurements through incorporation of probability of exposure given an individual's time of symptom onset (obtained through knowledge of the incubation period), and by instead focusing on the volume of carrying air which offers better insight into the most probable direction of the source. This then provides a probabilistic distribution of which direction the wind was blowing around the time of infection. We discuss how the probability-weighted wind rose can be implemented during a Legionnaires' disease outbreak, and how outbreak control teams might use it as supportive evidence to identify the most likely direction of the contaminated source from the presumed site of exposure. In addition, this paper discusses how minor adjustments can be made to the method allowing the probability-weighted wind rose to be applied to other non-communicable airborne diseases, providing the disease's probability distribution for the incubation period distribution is well known.","['Bays D', 'Bennett E', 'Finnie T']",2020,148,,Epidemiol Infect,"Bays D, et al.

FLA may also threaten the health of swimmers because they are capable of being hosts for Legionella and some other bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of total aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (TAHB), FLA and Legionella bacteria in swimming pool waters and biofilm samples in Istanbul by using culture and FISH methods. Water plate count agar (wPCA), buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar supplemented with glycinevancomycin-polymyxin-cycloheximide (GVPC) and Escherichia coli cultivated non-nutrient agar (NNA) were used for the culture of TAHB, Legionella and FLA. For the FISH method analysis , Leg 705 and Leg PNE1 probes labeled with fluorescent dye for Legionella and ACANTHA probe for Acanthamoeba genus FLA were used. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 ATCC 33152, L.pneumophila serogroup 3 ATCC 33155 and Acanthamoeba castellani ATCC 50373 were used as positive controls. TAHB were grown in 92% and 84% of water and biofilm samples. Although Legionella bacteria could not be grown in any of the water samples, it was detected in 6 (24%) water samples by FISH method. Although these bacteria could be grown in 1 (4%) of biofilm samples, 7 (28%) were detected by FISH method. FLA were found to be 16% by culture in water samples and 28% by FISH analysis. These amoebae were detected 8% and 20% in biofilm samples by culture and FISH method, respectively. It was determined that one of the isolates of FLA had thermotolerant activity (potentially pathogenic). L.pneumophila serogroup 1 was detected in one water sample and in four biofilm samples. According to the culture method, TAHB and FLA were found to be more common in water samples than in biofilm samples and Legionella bacteria were more common in biofilm samples than in water samples (p≤ 0.05). In the detection of Legionella bacteria, the superiority of FISH method compared to culture method was found to be statistically significant (p≤ 0.05). In this study, it was found that the number of TAHB in the controlled swimming pools was within the limits determined by the Ministry of Health (≤ 200 cfu/ml). It will be appropriate to examine both water and biofilm samples for the investigation of TAHB, FLA and Legionella. It may be appropriate to use both culture and FISH methods to detect the presence of FLA in water and biofilm samples. This study is the first study to investigate the presence of Legionella and FLA in swimming pools in Istanbul, and further studies are needed to examine more pool water and biofilm samples. With the data obtained, the health principles and controls of swimming pools will be re-considered and will be contributed to public health.","['Zeybek Z', 'Türkmen A']",2020,54,1,Mikrobiyol Bul,Zeybek Z and Türkmen A.

32044688,The vacuole guard hypothesis: how intravacuolar pathogens fight to maintain the integrity of their beloved home.,"Intravacuolar bacterial pathogens establish intracellular niches by constructing membrane-encompassed compartments. The vacuoles surrounding the bacteria are remarkably stable, facilitating microbial replication and preventing exposure to host cytoplasmically localized innate immune sensing mechanisms. To maintain integrity of the membrane compartment, the pathogen is armed with defensive weapons that prevent loss of vacuole integrity and potential exposure to host innate signaling. In some cases, the microbial components that maintain vacuolar integrity have been identified, but the basis for why the compartment degrades in their absence is unclear. In this review, we point out that lessons from the microbial-programmed degradation of the vacuole by the cytoplasmically localized Shigella flexneri provide crucial insights into how degradation of pathogen vacuoles occurs. We propose that in the absence of bacterial-encoded guard proteins, aberrant trafficking of host membrane-associated components results in a dysfunctional pathogen compartment. As a consequence, the vacuole is poisoned and replication is terminated.","['Anand I', 'Choi W', 'Isberg RR']",2020,54,,Curr Opin Microbiol,"Anand I, et al.

32030638,Ten-Year Retrospective Analysis of Legionella Diffusion in Hospital Water Systems and Its Serogroup Seasonal Variation.,"INTRODUCTION: Legionella spp. are ubiquitous aquatic organisms found to be associated with community-acquired pneumoniae (CAP) as well as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Direct inhalation of aerosols from environmental colonisation is typically the source of infection. The aim of this study was to determine the level of colonisation in hospital water supply systems in order to assess the criticality of the water distribution network and strengthen preventive measures.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2018, 769 water samples were collected and then analysed according to the standard methods indicated in ISO11731-2:2004 and ISO11731:2017 for Legionella detection.
RESULTS: The samples were positive in 37.1% cases (n. 285) and negative in 62.9% cases (n. 484). The threshold of 10,000 CFU/L was exceeded in 15.1% cases and led to decolonisation as indicated by Italian and European ECDC guidelines. In the autumn-winter period SG1 showed a positivity of 41.2% (n. 40) with a decrease in the spring-summer period with 9.6% (n. 18) of positivity. In contrast, SG2-15 showed a positivity of 30.9% (n. 30) in autumn-winter, which tends to increase to 56.9% (n. 112) in spring-summer (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Surprisingly, besides showing a seasonal trend already described previously in the literature, the positivity of our sample was not balanced even for serogroups in the two periods. This could be due to genetic differences and ecological niches to be further investigated that could also have links with the greater pathogenicity of SG1. Environmental microbiological surveillance and risk assessment should be performed more frequently and disinfection must be carried out, especially in health facilities where people are more susceptible to infections.","['Bertolino G', 'Marras L', 'Sanna C', 'Carrucciu G', 'Schintu M', 'Coroneo V']",2020,1282,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Bertolino G, et al.

32005846,Core gene-based molecular detection and identification of Acanthamoeba species.,"Acanthamoeba spp. are predominant free-living amoebae of water and soil. They have been used as tools for the isolation and culture of microbes that resist after their phagocytosis, such as Legionella-like bacteria, and, more recently giant viruses for which differences in permissiveness have been reported. However, problems have been reported regarding their identification at the species level. The present work implemented specific PCR systems for the detection and identification of Acanthamoeba species through comparison of sequences and phylogenetic analyses. Thirty-three Acanthamoeba isolates were studied, including 20 reference strains and 13 isolates retrieved from water, soil or clinical samples. Previous delineation of a core genome encompassing 826 genes based on draft genome sequences from 14 Acanthamoeba species allowed designing PCR systems for one of these core genes that encodes an alanine-tRNA ligase. These primers allowed an efficient and specific screening to detect Acanthamoeba presence. In addition, they identified all 20 reference strains, while partial and complete sequences coding for 18S ribosomal RNA identified only 11 (55%). We found that four isolates may be considered as new Acanthamoeba species. Consistent with previous studies, we demonstrated that some Acanthamoeba isolates were incorrectly assigned to species using the 18S rDNA sequences. Our implemented tool may help determining which Acanthamoeba strains are the most efficient for the isolation of associated microorganisms.","['Chelkha N', 'Jardot P', 'Moussaoui I', 'Levasseur A', 'La Scola B', 'Colson P']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Chelkha N, et al.

31988381,Combinatorial selection in amoebal hosts drives the evolution of the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila.,"Virulence mechanisms typically evolve through the continual interaction of a pathogen with its host. In contrast, it is poorly understood how environmentally acquired pathogens are able to cause disease without prior interaction with humans. Here, we provide experimental evidence for the model that Legionella pathogenesis in humans results from the cumulative selective pressures of multiple amoebal hosts in the environment. Using transposon sequencing, we identify Legionella pneumophila genes required for growth in four diverse amoebae, defining universal virulence factors commonly required in all host cell types and amoeba-specific auxiliary genes that determine host range. By comparing genes that promote growth in amoebae and macrophages, we show that adaptation of L. pneumophila to each amoeba causes the accumulation of distinct virulence genes that collectively allow replication in macrophages and, in some cases, leads to redundancy in this host cell type. In contrast, some bacterial proteins that promote replication in amoebae restrict growth in macrophages. Thus, amoebae-imposed selection is a double-edged sword, having both positive and negative impacts on disease. Comparing the genome composition and host range of multiple Legionella species, we demonstrate that their distinct evolutionary trajectories in the environment have led to the convergent evolution of compensatory virulence mechanisms.","['Park JM', 'Ghosh S', ""O'Connor TJ""]",2020,5,4,Nat Microbiol,"Park JM, et al.

Evaporative cooling systems (ECS), including cooling towers, used in industrial processes to dissipate excessive heat are prone to contamination by Legionella. From these systems it is possible for contaminated aerosols to be dispersed over a wide area, potentially exposing workers on site, neighbouring workplaces or nearby members of the public. Analysis of reported data on outbreaks of LD in Great Britain, collated for a ten year period, identified 44 separate legionellosis outbreaks of which seven were attributed to ECS and were responsible for 229 infections and 10 fatalities. This prompted an examination of health and safety inspection records which revealed, over a five year period, 321 enforcement actions taken against failings in Legionella control, of which 31% were attributed to cooling towers. Based on this evidence, an intervention programme was undertaken by health and safety inspectors in which 1,906 sites with ECS were inspected. During these inspections, sites were rated against four topics that are used to demonstrate compliance with statutory requirements for Legionella control: Risk Assessment; Written Control Scheme; Implementation of Control Scheme; and Record Keeping. While there was compliance at the majority of sites, breaches of the legislation were found at 625 sites (33% of those inspected), leading to 409 Improvement Notices (compelling dutyholders to make improvements to health and safety breaches of law in a given timeframe) and 12 Prohibition Notices (compelling dutyholders to stop work until they have remedied breaches in health and safety law) being served at 229 sites (12.0% of those inspected). Data from the intervention programme was analysed to identify root causes of these breaches of legislation on Legionella control. The majority of Improvement Notices (53%) were issued for the 'lack of effective implementation of a Written Control Scheme', with 'Risk Assessment' and 'Written Control Scheme' both accounting for 23%. More detailed examination showed major problems to be lack of training; failure to maintain the cleanliness of cooling towers and the water within them; risk assessments either being absent or not up to date, i.e., no longer representing the risks present; and Written Control Schemes being absent or insufficiently detailed. This provides a valuable data resource for dutyholders, so that they can understand where they need to focus to achieve significant improvement in legal compliance and therefore reduce the risk of LD for employees and members of the public affected by their workplace, and valuable data for regulators to target future interventions aimed at improving dutyholder compliance leading to better protection of workers and members of the public.","['Crook B', 'Willerton L', 'Smith D', 'Wilson L', 'Poran V', 'Helps J', 'McDermott P']",2020,224,,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Crook B, et al.

31978736,Serotyping and detection of pathogenecity loci of environmental isolates of Legionella pneumophila using MALDI-TOF MS.,"BACKGROUND: The majority of Legionnaires' disease cases is attributed to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1). Moreover, pathogenicity loci lvh and rtxA were associated with the ability of Lp strains to cause the disease. Consequently, except from serogroup assignment the detection of the aforementioned virulence genes during Legionella detection in water samples, could help environmental risk assessment and the implementation of targeted control measures.
AIM: To establish and validate a rapid and robust MALDI-TOF MS-based method for the assignment of Lp isolates to serogroup, and identify distinct peak biomarkers for the detection of lvh and rtxA loci during environmental investigations.
METHOD: Fifteen reference strains and 150 Lp environmental isolates (70 Lp1 and 80 Lp2-15 strains) were used. All strains were PCR-tested for the presence of lvh and rtxA loci. Independent training and validation strain sets were constituted and all strains were protein-extracted and submitted to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The raw spectra of the training set strains obtained, were introduced into the Mass-Up software platform for biomarker detection, for both serogroup assignment and pathogenicity loci detection. Validation of the assigned biomarkers followed using the validation set strains.
RESULTS: For serogroup assignment, the Mass-up analysis indicated five potential discriminating peaks and correctly classified 115 out of 132 validation set strains, displaying sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 86.7% and 87.1% accuracy. Concerning the pathogenicity loci detection, the Mass-up analysis indicated two ion peaks for rtxA locus discrimination and one peak for lvh locus discrimination. Concerning the lvh virulence gene, the algorithm correctly classified 113 out of 137 positive and all negative strains 14 in total-showing sensitivity of 82.5%, specificity of 100.% and 84.1% accuracy. For rtxA locus, 134 out of 134 positive and 14 out of 17 negative strains were correctly classified with sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 76.5% and 97.4% accuracy.
CONCLUSION: MALDI-TOF MS displayed good performance for Lp serogroup assignment and detection of the lvh and rtxA virulence genes. These findings could contribute to the rapid, inexpensive and comprehensive case investigation and risk assessment. Further studies are needed to standardize and evaluate the method using the direct target plate protein profiling instead of protein extraction in order to simplify the protocol. .","['Kyritsi MA', 'Kristo I', 'Hadjichristodoulou C']",2020,224,,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Kyritsi MA, et al.

We present the case of a 60-year-old man diagnosed with eosinophilic fasciitis with extensive cutaneous involvement and severe functional repercussion, which appeared weeks after suffering from pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila. The patient did not experience any clinical response with high-dose corticosteroids, subcutaneous methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Consequently, tocilizumab was initiated at 8 mg/Kg monthly achieving clinical response measured by a control MRI at the fifth dose. Response in terms of cutaneous thickness has been slower however favourable, therefore, more months of follow-up are necessary to assess the complete remission at skin level. EF treatment still constitutes a challenge, and experience with tocilizumab in the management of the disease is very limited. Through a systematic search of medical literature, we retrieved two cases describing EF treated with tocilizumab and several cases using another monoclonal antibody or Janus kinase inhibitor. We report the third case to our knowledge of the efficacy of tocilizumab in a refractory EF to corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs.","['Vílchez-Oya F', 'Sánchez-Schmidt JM', 'Agustí A', 'Pros A']",2020,39,5,Clin Rheumatol,"Vílchez-Oya F, et al.

31955059,"Assessing the water quality impacts of two Category-5 hurricanes on St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.","Managing waterborne and water-related diseases is one of the most critical factors in the aftermath of hurricane-induced natural disasters. The goal of the study was to identify water-quality impairments in order to set the priorities for post-hurricane relief and to guide future decisions on disaster preparation and relief administration. Field investigations were carried out on St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands as soon as the disaster area became accessible after the back-to-back hurricane strikes by Irma and Maria in 2017. Water samples were collected from individual household rain cisterns, the coastal ocean, and street-surface runoffs for microbial concentration. The microbial community structure and the occurrence of potential human pathogens were investigated in samples using next generation sequencing. Loop mediated isothermal amplification was employed to detect fecal indicator bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis. The results showed both fecal indicator bacteria and Legionella genetic markers were prevalent but were low in concentration in the water samples. Among the 22 cistern samples, 86% were positive for Legionella and 82% for Escherichia-Shigella. Enterococcus faecalis was detected in over 68% of the rain cisterns and in 60% of the coastal waters (n = 20). Microbial community composition in coastal water samples was significantly different from cistern water and runoff water. Although identification at bacterial genus level is not direct evidence of human pathogens, our results suggest cistern water quality needs more organized attention for protection of human health, and that preparation and prevention measures should be taken before natural disasters strike.","['Jiang SC', 'Han M', 'Chandrasekaran S', 'Fang Y', 'Kellogg CA']",2020,171,,Water Res,"Jiang SC, et al.

31940510,"Residential water heater cleaning and occurrence of Legionella in Flint, MI.","After the Federal emergency in Flint, MI was declared in early 2016 in response to elevated lead-in-water and incidence of Legionnaires' disease, concerns arose that contaminants in residential water heaters could continue to contribute to poor quality tap water. Here, a comprehensive field survey of residential water heaters (n = 30) and associated water quality was conducted and the subsequent effects of an aggressive manual water heater clean-out was determined, including draining the tank and removing sediments via brushing and flushing. Before cleaning, inorganics accumulated in the tank sediments did not serve as a source of metals measured at hot water outlets. After cleaning, hardness- (calcium, magnesium, silica) and corrosion-associated inorganics (lead, iron, copper, aluminum, zinc) decreased by 64% in samples from sediment cleanout drain valves. Culturable L. pneumophila was only detected in 1 home (3.3%) prior to cleaning and 2 homes (6.7%) after cleaning, thus quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify potential effects on unculturable strains despite the limitation of differentiating live and dead cells. After the cleaning protocol, Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila gene numbers decreased or remained non-detectable in 83% and 98% of samples, respectively. Homes with less than 0.4 mg/L influent free chlorine tended to have quantifiable Legionella spp. gene numbers in water entering the home and had elevated L. pneumophila and Legionella spp. gene numbers throughout the home plumbing. Also, Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila gene numbers were highest for water heaters set at or below ∼42 °C and significantly decreased >51 °C, consistent with Legionella's preferred temperature range. Examination of the only home that had culturable L. pneumophila both before and after the cleaning protocol revealed that the organism was culturable from several sample locations throughout the home, including in water representative of the water main. Notably, the home was located in close proximity to McLaren Hospital, where an outbreak of Legionnaires disease was reported, and the water heater had a setpoint within the Legionella growth range of 44.2 °C. Considering that other factors were more strongly associated with Legionella occurrence and water heater sediment was not detectably mobilizing to tap water, it was concluded that water heater cleaning had some benefits, but was not an overarching factor contributing to possible human health risks.","['Rhoads WJ', 'Bradley TN', 'Mantha A', 'Buttling L', 'Keane T', 'Pruden A', 'Edwards MA']",2020,171,,Water Res,"Rhoads WJ, et al.

31940328,"Photocatalytic biocidal effect of copper doped TiO2 nanotube coated surfaces under laminar flow, illuminated with UVA light on Legionella pneumophila.","Legionella pneumophila can cause a potentially fatal form of humane pneumonia (Legionnaires' disease), which is most problematic in immunocompromised and in elderly people. Legionella species is present at low concentrations in soil, natural and artificial aquatic systems and is therefore constantly entering man-made water systems. The environment temperature for it's ideal growth range is between 32 and 42°C, thus hot water pipes represent ideal environment for spread of Legionella. The bacteria are dormant below 20°C and do not survive above 60°C. The primary method used to control the risk from Legionella is therefore water temperature control. There are several other effective treatments to prevent growth of Legionella in water systems, however current disinfection methods can be applied only intermittently thus allowing Legionella to grow in between treatments. Here we present an alternative disinfection method based on antibacterial coatings with Cu-TiO2 nanotubes deposited on preformed surfaces. In the experiment the microbiocidal efficiency of submicron coatings on polystyrene to the bacterium of the genus Legionella pneumophila with a potential use in a water supply system was tested. The treatment thus constantly prevents growth of Legionella pneumophila in presence of water at room temperature. Here we show that 24-hour illumination with low power UVA light source (15 W/m2 UVA illumination) of copper doped TiO2 nanotube coated surfaces is effective in preventing growth of Legionella pneumophila. Microbiocidal effects of Cu-TiO2 nanotube coatings were dependent on the flow of the medium and the intensity of UV-A light. It was determined that tested submicron coatings have microbiocidal effects specially in a non-flow or low-flow conditions, as in higher flow rates, probably to a greater possibility of Legionella pneumophila sedimentation on the coated polystyrene surfaces, meanwhile no significant differences among bacteria reduction was noted regarding to non or low flow of medium.","['Oder M', 'Koklič T', 'Umek P', 'Podlipec R', 'Štrancar J', 'Dobeic M']",2020,15,1,PLoS One,"Oder M, et al.

31935215,Whole genome sequence analysis reveals the broad distribution of the RtxA type 1 secretion system and four novel putative type 1 secretion systems throughout the Legionella genus.,"Type 1 secretion systems (T1SSs) are broadly distributed among bacteria and translocate effectors with diverse function across the bacterial cell membrane. Legionella pneumophila, the species most commonly associated with Legionellosis, encodes a T1SS at the lssXYZABD locus which is responsible for the secretion of the virulence factor RtxA. Many investigations have failed to detect lssD, the gene encoding the membrane fusion protein of the RtxA T1SS, in non-pneumophila Legionella, which has led to the assumption that this system is a virulence factor exclusively possessed by L. pneumophila. Here we discovered RtxA and its associated T1SS in a novel Legionella taurinensis strain, leading us to question whether this system may be more widespread than previously thought. Through a bioinformatic analysis of publicly available data, we classified and determined the distribution of four T1SSs including the RtxA T1SS and four novel T1SSs among diverse Legionella spp. The ABC transporter of the novel Legionella T1SS Legionella repeat protein secretion system shares structural similarity to those of diverse T1SS families, including the alkaline protease T1SS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The Legionella bacteriocin (1-3) secretion systems T1SSs are novel putative bacteriocin transporting T1SSs as their ABC transporters include C-39 peptidase domains in their N-terminal regions, with LB2SS and LB3SS likely constituting a nitrile hydratase leader peptide transport T1SSs. The LB1SS is more closely related to the colicin V T1SS in Escherichia coli. Of 45 Legionella spp. whole genomes examined, 19 (42%) were determined to possess lssB and lssD homologs. Of these 19, only 7 (37%) are known pathogens. There was no difference in the proportions of disease associated and non-disease associated species that possessed the RtxA T1SS (p = 0.4), contrary to the current consensus regarding the RtxA T1SS. These results draw into question the nature of RtxA and its T1SS as a singular virulence factor. Future studies should investigate mechanistic explanations for the association of RtxA with virulence.","['Brown CL', 'Garner E', 'Jospin G', 'Coil DA', 'Schwake DO', 'Eisen JA', 'Mukhopadhyay B', 'Pruden AJ']",2020,15,1,PLoS One,"Brown CL, et al.

31931228,"Impact of temperature on Legionella pneumophila, its protozoan host cells, and the microbial diversity of the biofilm community of a pilot cooling tower.","Legionella pneumophila is a waterborne bacterium known for causing Legionnaires' Disease, a severe pneumonia. Cooling towers are a major source of outbreaks, since they provide ideal conditions for L. pneumophila growth and produce aerosols. In such systems, L. pneumophila typically grow inside protozoan hosts. Several abiotic factors such as water temperature, pipe material and disinfection regime affect the colonization of cooling towers by L. pneumophila. The local physical and biological factors promoting the growth of L. pneumophila in water systems and its spatial distribution are not well understood. Therefore, we built a lab-scale cooling tower to study the dynamics of L. pneumophila colonization in relationship to the resident microbiota and spatial distribution. The pilot was filled with water from an operating cooling tower harboring low levels of L. pneumophila. It was seeded with Vermamoeba vermiformis, a natural host of L. pneumophila, and then inoculated with L. pneumophila. After 92 days of operation, the pilot was disassembled, the water was collected, and biofilm was extracted from the pipes. The microbiome was studied using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes amplicon sequencing. The communities of the water and of the biofilm were highly dissimilar. The relative abundance of Legionella in water samples reached up to 11% whereas abundance in the biofilm was extremely low (≤0.5%). In contrast, the host cells were mainly present in the biofilm. This suggests that L. pneumophila grows in host cells associated with biofilm and is then released back into the water following host cell lysis. In addition, water temperature shaped the bacterial and eukaryotic community of the biofilm, indicating that different parts of the systems may have different effects on Legionella growth.","['Paniagua AT', 'Paranjape K', 'Hu M', 'Bédard E', 'Faucher SP']",2020,712,,Sci Total Environ,"Paniagua AT, et al.

31926439,Variation of antibiotic resistome during commercial livestock manure composting.,"Composting has been widely used to turn livestock manure into organic fertilizer. However, livestock manure contains various contaminants including antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Here we investigated the variation of antibiotic resistome and its influencing factors during a commercial livestock manure composting. The results showed that composting could effectively reduce the relative abundance of ARGs and mobile genic elements (MGEs). As the dominant phylum in the composting samples, the key potential bacterial host of ARGs were Actinobacteria such as Leucobacter, Mycobacterium and Thermomonosporaceae unclassified. Meanwhile, Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Haemophilus ducreyi and Siccibacter turicensis may be the key potential pathogenic host of ARGs because of their co-occurrence with ARG subtypes. Redundancy analysis showed that the dissipation of ARGs during composting was linked to various environmental factors such as moisture. Bacterial succession as well as profile of biocide and metal resistance genes (BMRGs) were the determinants which constructed the antibiotic resistome during manure composting. However, the residues of ARGs and pathogens in compost products may still pose risks to human and crops after fertilization.","['Zhang M', 'He LY', 'Liu YS', 'Zhao JL', 'Zhang JN', 'Chen J', 'Zhang QQ', 'Ying GG']",2020,136,,Environ Int,"Zhang M, et al.

While inhaled epoprostenol does not improve mortality, improving oxygenation allows for transport of severely hypoxemic patients to tertiary care centers with a related improvement in mortality rates. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use is increasing in frequency for patients with refractory hypoxemia, and with increasing regionalization of care, safe transport of hypoxemic patients only becomes more important. In this series, four cases are presented of young patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from Legionnaires' disease transported on inhaled epoprostenol to ECMO centers for consideration of cannulation.

31904109,Legionella pneumophila occurrence in drinking water supplied by private wells.,"Unregulated private wells are understudied potential sources of community-acquired Legionnaires' disease. Here we conducted a comprehensive survey of 44 homes supplied by private wells in Wake County, North Carolina, quantifying Legionella spp. DNA, Legionella pneumophila DNA, and total bacterial 16S rRNA genes via real-time polymerase chain reaction in hot and cold drinking water samples, along with culturable L. pneumophila via IDEXX Legiolert in cold drinking water samples. Legionella spp. DNA, L. pneumophila DNA and culturable L. pneumophila were detected in 100, 65·5 and 15·9% of the 44 homes, respectively, and culturable levels were comparable to some municipal surveys applying the same methods. Total coliforms and Escherichia coli were monitored as representative faecal indicators and were found in 20·4 and 0·0% of homes. Within certain sample types, Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila gene copy numbers were positively associated with total bacteria (i.e. total 16S rRNA genes) and water softener use, but were not associated with faecal indicator bacteria, inorganic water parameters or other well characteristics. These findings confirm that occurrence of Legionella and L. pneumophila is highly variable in private wells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Legionella is the leading identified cause of waterborne disease outbreaks associated with US municipal water systems. While Legionella is known to occur naturally in groundwater, prior efforts to characterize its occurrence in unregulated private wells are limited to sampling at the wellhead and not in the home plumbing where Legionella can thrive. This work documents much higher levels of Legionella in home plumbing versus water directly from private wells and examines factors associated with higher Legionella occurrence.","['Mapili K', 'Pieper KJ', 'Dai D', 'Pruden A', 'Edwards MA', 'Tang M', 'Rhoads WJ']",2020,70,4,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Mapili K, et al.

31882569,Legionella Pneumonia in Late Pregnancy.,"BACKGROUND Legionella pneumonia can be an aggressive form of pneumonia. However, it is rare in pregnant women, particularly in the peripartum period. To the best of our knowledge this is the only case of Legionella pneumonia with endometrial sepsis. We are reporting a patient with this rare condition. CASE REPORT The patient was an 18-year-old female, pregnant with her first baby, who developed symptoms of the common cold near term. The patient was seen at another major facility initially and was discharged home with a diagnosis of ""cold"". She was still uncomfortable and came to our facility Aront Ogden Medical Center Elmira, NY, USA, where she had rupture of membranes and underwent C-section. She was suspected clinically of having pneumonia. Initial chest x-ray was negative, but computed tomography (CT)-scan did show bilateral pneumonia. Further workup confirmed the diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia and was treated for that as well as for endometritis. She did require Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care during her hospital stay. The patient was seen and evaluated by multiple subspecialties, including Critical Care, Infectious Disease, and Gastroenterology subspecialties. The patient improved steadily, and was later discharged home in the care of her family with a healthy baby and was advised to follow up with her Primary Medical Provider as outpatient. CONCLUSIONS Legionella pneumonia in pregnancy may be more common than we think, and could be easily overlooked in that patient population, have to be in the back mind of medical provider. Overlooking diagnosis could lead to serious adverse consequences for these patients.","['Mosaad-Boktor HK', 'Lee SA']",2019,20,,Am J Case Rep,Mosaad-Boktor HK and Lee SA.

31875613,Investigations on Contamination of Environmental Water Samples by Legionella using Real-Time Quantitative PCR Combined with Amoebic Co-Culturing.,"We analyzed the contamination of environmental water samples with Legionella spp. using a conventional culture method, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and real-time qPCR combined with an amoebic co-culture method. Samples (n = 110) were collected from 19 cooling towers, 31 amenity water facilities, and 60 river water sources of tap water in Japan. Legionella was detected in only three samples (3/110, 2.7%) using the culture method. The rate of Legionella detection using amoebic co-culture followed by qPCR was 74.5%, while that using qPCR without amoebic co-culture was 75.5%. A higher than 10-fold bacterial count was observed in 19 samples (19/110, 17.3%) using real-time qPCR subsequent to amoebic co-culture, compared with identical samples analyzed without co-culture. Of these 19 samples, 13 were identified as Legionella spp., including L. pneumophila and L. anisa, and the non-culturable species were identified as L. lytica and L. rowbothamii. This study showed that the detection of Legionella spp., even in those samples where they were not detected by the culture method, was possible using real-time qPCR and an amoebic co-culture method. In addition, this analytical test combination is a useful tool to detect viable and virulent Legionella spp..","['Edagawa A', 'Kimura A', 'Miyamoto H']",2019,24,4,Biocontrol Sci,"Edagawa A, et al.

31863584,CHC22 clathrin mediates traffic from early secretory compartments for human GLUT4 pathway biogenesis.,"Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is sequestered inside muscle and fat and then released by vesicle traffic to the cell surface in response to postprandial insulin for blood glucose clearance. Here, we map the biogenesis of this GLUT4 traffic pathway in humans, which involves clathrin isoform CHC22. We observe that GLUT4 transits through the early secretory pathway more slowly than the constitutively secreted GLUT1 transporter and localize CHC22 to the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). CHC22 functions in transport from the ERGIC, as demonstrated by an essential role in forming the replication vacuole of Legionella pneumophila bacteria, which requires ERGIC-derived membrane. CHC22 complexes with ERGIC tether p115, GLUT4, and sortilin, and downregulation of either p115 or CHC22, but not GM130 or sortilin, abrogates insulin-responsive GLUT4 release. This indicates that CHC22 traffic initiates human GLUT4 sequestration from the ERGIC and defines a role for CHC22 in addition to retrograde sorting of GLUT4 after endocytic recapture, enhancing pathways for GLUT4 sequestration in humans relative to mice, which lack CHC22.","['Camus SM', 'Camus MD', 'Figueras-Novoa C', 'Boncompain G', 'Sadacca LA', 'Esk C', 'Bigot A', 'Gould GW', 'Kioumourtzoglou D', 'Perez F', 'Bryant NJ', 'Mukherjee S', 'Brodsky FM']",2020,219,1,J Cell Biol,"Camus SM, et al.

The incidence in the district was 7 cases/100 000 population, exceeding the maximum annual incidence in the previous 5 years of 1.5/100 000. Epidemiological, environmental and geographical investigations identified a cooling tower (CT) as the most likely source. The case risk around the tower decreased with increasing distance and was highest within 5 km. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, ST48, was identified in a human respiratory sample but could not be matched with the environmental results. Public health authorities imposed measures to control the contamination of the CT and organised follow-up sampling. We identified obstacles encountered during the cluster investigation and formulated recommendations for improved LD cluster management, including faster coordination of teams through the outbreak control team, improved communication about clinical and environmental sample analysis, more detailed documentation of potential exposures obtained through the case questionnaire and earlier use of a geographical information tool to compare potential sources and for hypothesis generation.","['Hammami N', 'Laisnez V', 'Wybo I', 'Uvijn D', 'Broucke C', 'Van Damme A', 'Van Zandweghe L', 'Bultynck W', 'Temmerman W', 'Van De Ginste L', 'Moens T', 'Robesyn E']",2019,147,,Epidemiol Infect,"Hammami N, et al.

31855786,Evidence of viable Helicobacter pylori and other bacteria of public health interest associated with free-living amoebae in lettuce samples by next generation sequencing and other molecular techniques.,"Vegetables are one of the sources from which Helicobacter pylori can be acquired. This bacterium infects >50% of the global population and is a recognized type I human carcinogen. H. pylori enters into the viable but non-culturable state when it is in the environment, and therefore the use of molecular techniques is much convenient for its detection. Free-living amoebae (FLA) are protozoans found in vegetables. They are transmission vehicles for amoeba-resistant bacteria, among which H. pylori is included. The aim of this study is to study the occurrence and viability of H. pylori from lettuce samples, H. pylori internalized into FLA and the microbiome of FLA isolated from these samples. Special focus was pointed to human pathogenic bacteria. H. pylori was not directly detected in any lettuce sample by means of molecular techniques and neither by culture. However, intra-amoebic H. pylori DNA was detected by means of PMA-qPCR in 55% of the samples and viable intra-amoebic H. pylori cells in 25% of the samples by means of DVC-FISH technique. When FLA microbiome was studied, 21 bacterial genera were part of FLA microbiome in all samples. Helicobacter genus was detected as part of the FLA microbiome in two samples. Other bacteria of public health interest such as Aeromonas sp., Arcobacter sp., Legionella sp., Mycobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Salmonella sp. were detected as part of FLA microbiome along the analysed samples. This study demonstrates for the first time that H. pylori is internalized as well as alive inside FLA isolated from vegetables. Moreover, this study shows that FLA promote H. pylori detection in environmental samples. In addition, as far as we are aware, this is the first study which studies the microbiome of FLA isolated from vegetables. Among the FLA microbiome, bacteria of public health interest were detected, pointing out that FLA are carriers of these pathogens which can reach humans and cause a public health concern.","['Moreno-Mesonero L', 'Hortelano I', 'Moreno Y', 'Ferrús MA']",2020,318,,Int J Food Microbiol,"Moreno-Mesonero L, et al.

31845741,Bacterial DUBs: deubiquitination beyond the seven classes.,"Protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that regulates many aspects of cellular life, including proteostasis, vesicular trafficking, DNA repair and NF-κB activation. By directly targeting intracellular bacteria or bacteria-containing vacuoles to the lysosome, ubiquitination is also an important component of cell-autonomous immunity. Not surprisingly, several pathogenic bacteria encode deubiquitinases (DUBs) and use them as secreted effectors that prevent ubiquitination of bacterial components. A systematic overview of known bacterial DUBs, including their cleavage specificities and biological roles, suggests multiple independent acquisition events from host-encoded DUBs and other proteases. The widely used classification of DUBs into seven well-defined families should only be applied to eukaryotic DUBs, since several bacterial DUBs do not follow this classification.","['Hermanns T', 'Hofmann K']",2019,47,6,Biochem Soc Trans,Hermanns T and Hofmann K.

A retrospective Belgian multicenter study.,"Currently, diagnosis of legionellosis relies mainly on urinary antigen testing (UAT) for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1). However, this test has several limitations, particularly missing non-Lp1 infections. The purpose of this large multicenter study was to investigate the risk of missing legionellosis relying on UAT solely. Molecular results of Legionella detection as part of a first-line (syndromic) testing algorithm for severe respiratory tract infections were investigated retrospectively and compared with UAT results in 14 Belgian laboratories. Overall, 44.4% (20/45) UAT results appeared false negative and were reclassified as legionellosis based on PCR findings [Legionnaires' disease, 37.5% (15/40); Pontiac fever, 100% (5/5)]. A total of 39.4% (26/66) diagnosis probably would have been missed or delayed without a syndromic approach, as UAT or specific molecular testing for Legionella was not requested by the clinician.

31823727,Investigation of the host transcriptional response to intracellular bacterial infection using Dictyostelium discoideum as a host model.,"BACKGROUND: During infection by intracellular pathogens, a highly complex interplay occurs between the infected cell trying to degrade the invader and the pathogen which actively manipulates the host cell to enable survival and proliferation. Many intracellular pathogens pose important threats to human health and major efforts have been undertaken to better understand the host-pathogen interactions that eventually determine the outcome of the infection. Over the last decades, the unicellular eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum has become an established infection model, serving as a surrogate macrophage that can be infected with a wide range of intracellular pathogens. In this study, we use high-throughput RNA-sequencing to analyze the transcriptional response of D. discoideum when infected with Mycobacterium marinum and Legionella pneumophila. The results were compared to available data from human macrophages.
RESULTS: The majority of the transcriptional regulation triggered by the two pathogens was found to be unique for each bacterial challenge. Hallmark transcriptional signatures were identified for each infection, e.g. induction of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and autophagy genes in response to M. marinum and inhibition of genes associated with the translation machinery and energy metabolism in response to L. pneumophila. However, a common response to the pathogenic bacteria was also identified, which was not induced by non-pathogenic food bacteria. Finally, comparison with available data sets of regulation in human monocyte derived macrophages shows that the elicited response in D. discoideum is in many aspects similar to what has been observed in human immune cells in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and L. pneumophila.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents high-throughput characterization of D. discoideum transcriptional response to intracellular pathogens using RNA-seq. We demonstrate that the transcriptional response is in essence distinct to each pathogen and that in many cases, the corresponding regulation is recapitulated in human macrophages after infection by mycobacteria and L. pneumophila. This indicates that host-pathogen interactions are evolutionary conserved, derived from the early interactions between free-living phagocytic cells and bacteria. Taken together, our results strengthen the use of D. discoideum as a general infection model.","['Kjellin J', 'Pränting M', 'Bach F', 'Vaid R', 'Edelbroek B', 'Li Z', 'Hoeppner MP', 'Grabherr M', 'Isberg RR', 'Hagedorn M', 'Söderbom F']",2019,20,1,BMC Genomics,"Kjellin J, et al.

Methods Live LP and inactivated LP (MOI=10, 50, 100) were separately used to affect RAW264.7 for 1, 2 and 3 hours so as to screen the optimum condition of LP infection. The optimal condition for LP infection was MOI=50 and the infection time was 2 hours. After affected by rapamycin (RAPA) for 12 hours, RAW264.7 cells were then treated by live and inactivated LP for another 2 hours. Normal control group, RAPA group, live LP group, inactivated LP group, RAPA-treated live LP group, RAPA-treated inactivated LP group were designed. The pmCherry-C1-EGFP-LC3B double fluorescent labeling protein method was used to monitor the changes of autophagy flux. The relevant factor CLN3, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), regulator of G protein signaling 19 (RGS19), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cathepsin B (CTSB), GABA type A receptor associated protein like 2 (GABARAPL2), P62, microtubule-related protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) were screened by gene array analysis. In order to validate the results of gene array, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid derived 2 like 2 (Nrf2), beclin1 and kelch like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1); Western blot analysis was performed to measure the protein levels of Nrf2, beclin1 and Keap1. Results Both the live LP group and the inactivated LP group inhibited the autophagy flux compared with the normal control group and the RAPA group. Gene array analysis showed that in the live LP and inactivated LP groups, LC3 expression was down-regulated and P62 expression was up-regulated. The results of RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were consistent with the gene array.

31797948,Investigation of potential pathogenicity of Willaertia magna by investigating the transfer of bacteria pathogenicity genes into its genome.,"Willaertia magna c2c maky is a thermophilic amoeba closely related to the genus Naegleria. This free-living amoeba has the ability to eliminate Legionella pneumophila, which is an amoeba-resisting bacterium living in an aquatic environment. To prevent the proliferation of L. pneumophila in cooling towers, the use of W. magna as natural biocide has been proposed. To provide a better understanding of the W. magna genome, whole-genome sequencing was performed through the study of virulence factors and lateral gene transfers. This amoeba harbors a genome of 36.5 megabases with 18,519 predicted genes. BLASTp analyses reported protein homology between 136 W. magna sequences and amoeba-resistant microorganisms. Horizontal gene transfers were observed based on the basis of the phylogenetic reconstruction hypothesis.

31795996,"Evaluation of the national surveillance of Legionnaires' disease in Norway, 2008-2017.","BACKGROUND: In Norway, Legionnaires' disease is reportable upon clinical suspicion to public health authorities and mandatorily notifiable through the Norwegian surveillance system for communicable diseases (MSIS) for both clinicians and laboratories. In the summer of 2017, several European countries reported high notification rates for Legionnaires' disease, which was not observed in Norway. We evaluated MSIS to assess if it meets its objectives of detecting cases and trends in incidence of Legionnaires' disease.
METHODS: We retrieved MSIS data from 2008 to 2017 and calculated timeliness as days from sampling to notification, and internal completeness for key variables as the proportion of observations with a value. Where possible, we assessed internal validity on the presence of a plausible value. To estimate external completeness and validity we linked MSIS with hospital reimbursement claims in the Norwegian Patient Registry. To assess acceptability and representativeness, we surveyed doctors in 39 hospitals on their units' diagnostic and notification procedures, and their use of MSIS.
RESULTS: There were 438 notified cases. Internal completeness and internal validity were high for key variables (≥95%). The median delay from sampling to notification was 4 days. There were 73 patients in MSIS only, 70 in the Norwegian Patient Registry only, and 351 in both registers. The external completeness of MSIS was 83% (95% CI 80-86%). For external validity, the positive predictive value of MSIS was 83% (95% CI 79-86%). Forty-seven respondents from 28 hospitals described testing procedures. These were inconsistent: 29 (62%) reported no systematic application of criteria for requesting legionella testing. Eighteen (38%) reported testing all patients with suspected pneumonia and a travel history. Thirty-one (66%) found the notification criteria clear.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the surveillance in MSIS can detect incidence changes for Legionnaires' disease over time, by place and person, but likely does not detect every case diagnosed in Norway. We recommend wider investigation of diagnostic procedures in order to improve representativeness and awareness of MSIS notification criteria among clinicians in order to improve acceptability of the surveillance. We also recommend a more comprehensive assessment of whether patients only registered in the Norwegian Patient Registry were true Legionnaires' disease cases.","['Wolff C', 'Lange H', 'Feruglio S', 'Vold L', 'MacDonald E']",2019,19,1,BMC Public Health,"Wolff C, et al.

These droplets can be dispersed in the atmosphere several kilometers from their source. The most common such sources are contaminated water within cooling towers and other air-conditioning systems but other sources such as ornamental fountains and spa pools have also caused outbreaks of the disease in the past. There is an obvious need to locate and eliminate any such sources as quickly as possible. Here a maximum likelihood model estimating the source of an outbreak from case location data has been developed and implemented. Unlike previous models, the average dose exposure sub-model is formulated using a atmospheric dispersion model. How the uncertainty in inferred parameters can be estimated is discussed. The model is applied to the 2012 Edinburgh Legionnaires' disease outbreak.","['Dyke S', 'Barrass I', 'Pollock K', 'Hall IM']",2019,14,11,PLoS One,"Dyke S, et al.

31759642,Effect of temperature on opportunistic pathogen gene markers and microbial communities in long-term stored roof-harvested rainwater.,"Roof-harvested rainwater (RHRW) has received increasing attention in recent years as an alternative water source for domestic use, yet its biological stability during storage is not fully understood. This study investigated the effects of temperature (4 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C) on the microbiological characteristics of RHRW over a storage period of 60 days by targeting different microbial groups including total bacteria and fecal indictor Escherichia coli, bacterial opportunistic pathogen genera and species (Legionella spp, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp, Mycobacterium avium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and two amoebas (Acanthamoeba and Vermamoeba vermiformis). The rainwater chemistry demonstrated no obvious change during storage. The highest biomass was observed in RHRW stored at 30 °C, as measured by heterotrophic bacterial counts, adenosine triphosphate, and 16S rRNA gene numbers. Gene markers of E. coli, Legionella spp., P. aeruginosa, and V. vermiformis were detected in fresh RHRW and can persist during RHRW storage; whereas P. aeruginosa was the only species demonstrated significant regrowth at higher storage temperatures (P < 0.05). Acanthamoeba spp. was only detected in RHRW after 50 days of storage at three investigated temperatures, highlighting increased health risks in long-term stored RHRW. Bacterial community compositions were significantly different in RHRW stored at different temperatures, with increased variations among triplicate storage bottles noted at higher temperatures along with storage time. The results provide insights into RHRW storage practices in terms of mitigating microbial contamination risks.","['Zhang X', 'Xia S', 'Zhao R', 'Wang H']",2020,181,,Environ Res,"Zhang X, et al.

Here, we describe identification of two bacterial effectors that reverse PR ubiquitination and are thus named deubiquitinases for PR ubiquitination (DUPs; DupA and DupB). Structural analyses revealed that DupA and SidE ubiquitin ligases harbor a highly homologous catalytic phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain. However, unlike SidE ubiquitin ligases, DupA displays increased affinity to PR-ubiquitinated substrates, which allows DupA to cleave PR ubiquitin from substrates. Interfering with DupA-ubiquitin binding switches its activity toward SidE-type ligase. Given the high affinity of DupA to PR-ubiquitinated substrates, we exploited a catalytically inactive DupA mutant to trap and identify more than 180 PR-ubiquitinated host proteins in Legionella-infected cells. Proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fragmentation and membrane recruitment to Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCV) emerged as major SidE targets. The global map of PR-ubiquitinated substrates provides critical insights into host-pathogen interactions during Legionella infection.","['Shin D', 'Mukherjee R', 'Liu Y', 'Gonzalez A', 'Bonn F', 'Liu Y', 'Rogov VV', 'Heinz M', 'Stolz A', 'Hummer G', 'Dötsch V', 'Luo ZQ', 'Bhogaraju S', 'Dikic I']",2020,77,1,Mol Cell,"Shin D, et al.

31726393,"Presence of Legionella spp. in cooling towers: the role of microbial diversity, Pseudomonas, and continuous chlorine application.","Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a severe pneumonia caused by several species of the genus Legionella, most frequently by Legionella pneumophila. Cooling towers are the most common source for large community-associated outbreaks. Colonization, survival, and proliferation of L. pneumophila in cooling towers are necessary for outbreaks to occur. These steps are affected by the chemical and physical parameters of the cooling tower environment. We hypothesize that the bacterial community residing in the cooling tower could also affect the presence of L. pneumophila. A 16S rRNA gene targeted amplicon sequencing approach was used to study the bacterial community of cooling towers and its relationship with the Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila communities. The results indicated that the water source shaped the bacterial community of cooling towers. Several taxa were enriched and positively correlated with Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila. In contrast, Pseudomonas showed a strong negative correlation with Legionella spp. and several other genera. Most importantly, continuous chlorine application reduced microbial diversity and promoted the presence of Pseudomonas creating a non-permissive environment for Legionella spp. This suggests that disinfection strategies as well as the resident microbial population influences the ability of Legionella spp. to colonize cooling towers.","['Paranjape K', 'Bédard É', 'Whyte LG', 'Ronholm J', 'Prévost M', 'Faucher SP']",2020,169,,Water Res,"Paranjape K, et al.

The symbiont confers resistance to Legionella pneumophila on its host; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this resistance is not completely understood. Genome analyses have been crucial for understanding the complicated host-symbiont relationship but segregating the host's genome DNA from the symbiont's DNA is often challenging. In this study, we successfully identified a bimodal genomic structure in Neochlamydia strain S13 using PacBio RS II supported by ultra-long reads derived from MinION. One mode consisted of circular sequences of 2,586,667 and 231,307 bp; the other was an integrated sequence of the two via long homologous regions. They encoded 2175 protein-coding regions, some of which were implied to be acquired via horizontal gene transfer. They were specifically conserved in the genus Neochlamydia and formed a cluster in the genome, presumably by multiplication through genome replication. Moreover, it was notable that the sequenced DNA was obtained without segregating the symbiont DNA from the host. This is an easy and versatile technique that facilitates the characterization of diverse hosts and symbionts in nature.","['Yamagishi J', 'Hayashida K', 'Matsuo J', 'Okubo T', 'Kuroda M', 'Nagai H', 'Sekizuka T', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Sugimoto C']",2020,65,1,J Hum Genet,"Yamagishi J, et al.

However, the roles of the LC3 interacting region (LIR) motifs in RavZ function remain unclear. In this study, we show that a membrane-targeting (MT) domain or the LIR motifs of RavZ play major or minor roles in RavZ function. A RavZ mutant that does not bind to mATG8 delipidated all forms of mATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as efficiently as did wild-type RavZ. However, a RavZ mutant with a deletion of the MT domain selectively delipidated mATG8-PE less efficiently than did wild-type RavZ.

31719622,Monitoring LC3- or GABARAP-positive autophagic membranes using modified RavZ-based probes.,"Xenophagy is a selective lysosomal degradation pathway for invading pathogens in host cells. However, invading bacteria also develop survival mechanisms to inhibit host autophagy. RavZ is a protein secreted by Legionella that irreversibly delipidates mammalian autophagy-related protein 8 (mATG8) on autophagic membranes in host cells via efficient autophagic membrane targeting. In this study, we leveraged the autophagic membrane-targeting mechanism of RavZ and generated a new autophagosome probe by replacing the catalytic domain of RavZ with GFP. This probe is efficiently localized to mATG8-positive autophagic membranes via a synergistic combination between mATG8 protein-binding mediated by the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs and phosphoinositide-3-phosphate (PI3P) binding mediated by the membrane-targeting (MT) domain. Furthermore, the membrane association activity of this new probe with an MT domain was more efficient than that of probes with a hydrophobic domain that were previously used in LIR-based autophagosome sensors. Finally, by substituting the LIR motifs of RavZ with selective LIR motifs from Fyco1 or ULK2, we developed new probes for detecting LC3A/B- or GABARAP subfamily-positive autophagic membranes, respectively. We propose that these new RavZ-based sensors will be useful for monitoring and studying the function of mATG8-positive autophagic membranes in different cellular contexts for autophagy research.","['Park SW', 'Jeon P', 'Jun YW', 'Park JH', 'Lee SH', 'Lee S', 'Lee JA', 'Jang DJ']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Park SW, et al.

31707135,The relevance of molecular genotyping to allocate cases in a suspected outbreak of Legionella pneumonia in patients with prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.,"Three cases of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) in immunosuppressed patients with repeated hospitalization were suspected as a healthcare-associated cluster. The environmental investigation did not reveal the presence of legionellae in the hospital patient rooms. Water samples collected from the homes of two patients were also negative for Legionella spp. In the absence of environmental strains potentially involved in the infections, we proceeded to genotype environmental Lp1 strains isolated in the hospital during routine water sampling during the decade 2009-2019 and recovered after long-term storage at -20°C. These 'historical' strains exhibited a high grade of similarity and stability over time, regardless of the disinfection systems. The different molecular profiles shown among the clinical and environmental strains excluded a nosocomial outbreak. The study suggests that the application of molecular typing may be a useful tool to discriminate hospital vs community-acquired cases, mostly for severely immunosuppressed patients in whom the symptomatology could be insidious and the incubation period could be prolonged. Moreover, the genotyping allowed us to exclude any link between the cases.","['Borella P', 'Vecchi E', 'Incerti F', 'Marchesi I', 'Meacci M', 'Frezza G', 'Fregni Serpini G', 'Mansi A', 'Paduano S', 'Bargellini A']",2020,91,,Int J Infect Dis,"Borella P, et al.

31705486,Leave it to Lefamulin: A Pleuromutilin Treatment Option in Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia.,"Lefamulin (BC-3781) is the first systemic pleuromutilin antibiotic found to be safe and effective in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in humans. This novel antibiotic was developed to combat the increasing incidence of bacterial resistance to current therapies. As the first semisynthetic pleuromutilin for systemic use in humans, lefamulin has demonstrated efficacy against the most common bacteria responsible for CABP, including strains exhibiting resistance to macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, vancomycin, and beta-lactams. In vitro studies have demonstrated efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophilia, and Moraxella catarrhalis at MIC values lower than those of currently available therapies. Two phase III trials (LEAP-1 and LEAP-2) have demonstrated similar findings, meeting non-inferiority criteria for CABP with a minimal side-effect profile. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations have shown sufficient drug levels in plasma, subcutaneous adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and epithelial lining fluid, warranting further investigation for other clinical uses. Lefamulin was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 19 August 2019 for the treatment of CABP.","['Lee YR', 'Jacobs KL']",2019,79,17,Drugs,Lee YR and Jacobs KL.

31704413,Metagenomic analysis of sludge and early-stage biofilm communities of a submerged membrane bioreactor.,"Biofilm formation on membranes in activated sludge membrane bioreactors (MBR), commonly identified as biofouling, is a significant problem for MBR operations. A better understanding of microbial species involved in the biofilm formation is needed to develop anti-biofilm measures. A read-based and genome-resolved shotgun metagenomic approach was applied to characterize the composition and functional potential of the sludge and early stage biofilm microbial communities in an MBR process. Read-based analysis revealed that the prevalence of different phyla are relatively similar in both the sludge and biofilm samples, with Proteobacteria as the most dominant, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes. However, the relative abundance of these phyla slightly varies between the sludge and biofilm. Phyla such as Actinobacteria, bacterial candidate phyla, Chlamydiae, Cyanobacteria/Melainabacteria and Firmicutes are 2 to 4 times more abundant in the biofilm than in the sludge. At the genus level, genera belonging to Proteobacteria (Legionella, Caulobacter, Sphingomonas, Acinetobacter and Rhizobium), Cyanobacteria (Hassallia), and Spirochaetes (Turneriella) are at least twice more abundant in the biofilm. These genera, especially those belonging to Phylum Proteobacteria, are known to play an important role in the formation of biofilms on surfaces. The Alpha diversity is found slightly higher in the biofilm, compared with sludge samples. Functional classification of reads through the SEED subsystem shows that functional classes such as those involved in the metabolism of various molecules are significantly different in the biofilm and sludge. A phylogenomic analysis of the six extracted metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) shows that three MAGs belong to Proteobacteria, and one MAG belong to each of Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes. The relative abundance of the MAG belonging to Alphaproteobacteria is higher in the biofilm. A functional potential analysis of the MAGs reveals their potential to metabolize carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes.","['Rehman ZU', 'Fortunato L', 'Cheng T', 'Leiknes T']",2020,701,,Sci Total Environ,"Rehman ZU, et al.

We examined the role of the multifunctional enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine/Methylthioadenosine (SAH/MTA) nucleosidase (Pfs) in the virulence of S. enterica var Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) in mice, using a defined Pfs deletion mutant (i.e. Δpfs). Pfs was essential for growth of S. Typhimurium in M9 minimal medium, in tissue cultured cells, and in mice. Studies to resolve which of the three known functions of Pfs were key to murine virulence suggested that downstream production of autoinducer-2, spermidine and methylthioribose were non-essential for Salmonella virulence in a highly sensitive murine model. Mass spectrometry revealed the accumulation of SAH in S. Typhimurium Δpfs and complementation of the Pfs mutant with the specific SAH hydrolase from Legionella pneumophila reduced SAH levels, fully restored growth ex vivo and the virulence of S. Typhimurium Δpfs for mice. The data suggest that Pfs may be a legitimate target for antimicrobial development, and that the key role of Pfs in bacterial virulence may be in reducing the toxic accumulation of SAH which, in turn, suppresses an undefined methyltransferase.","['Husna AU', 'Wang N', 'Wilksch JJ', 'Newton HJ', 'Hocking DM', 'Hay ID', 'Cobbold SA', 'Davies MR', 'McConville MJ', 'Lithgow T', 'Strugnell RA']",2019,476,22,Biochem J,"Husna AU, et al.

Increasingly, point-of-use (POU) filters are being used to prevent exposure to these pathogens. This study provides efficacy and performance specifications (membrane size, pore size, and use restrictions), which will aid in selecting POU filters.
METHODS: New faucet and shower filters rated for 62 days of use were evaluated at an acute care facility in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Five faucets and 5 showers served as controls or were equipped with filters. Hot water samples were collected weekly for 12 weeks and cultured for Legionella, heterotrophic plate count, and Pseudomonas. Literature searches for articles on POU filters used in health care settings were performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Filter specifications from 5 manufacturers were also compared.
RESULTS: The 62-day POU filters installed on both faucets and showers eliminated Legionella and reduced heterotrophic plate count concentrations for 12 weeks. No Pseudomonas was recovered during this study. Twenty peer-reviewed studies are summarized, and 21 features of 53 POU filters have been compiled.
CONCLUSIONS: The information provides infection preventionists and facility engineers with information to verify claims from manufacturers and compare differences among POU products, including validated efficacy, filter design, and operational specifications.","['Parkinson J', 'Baron JL', 'Hall B', 'Bos H', 'Racine P', 'Wagener MM', 'Stout JE']",2020,48,2,Am J Infect Control,"Parkinson J, et al.

31638905,The clinical presentation of Legionella arthritis reveals the mode of infection and the bacterial species: case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: While Legionella is a common cause of pneumonia, extrapulmonary infections like arthritis are scarce. Here, we describe a case of monoarthritis due to Legionella bozemanii, with no history of pneumonia. We provide a literature review of the 9 previously published Legionella arthritis and highlight a dichotomous epidemiology suggesting different physiopathological pathways leading to joint infection.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year old woman under immunosuppressive treatment by oral and intra-articular corticosteroids, methotrexate, and tocilizumab for an anti-synthetase syndrome was hospitalized for worsening pain and swelling of the left wrist for 3 days. Clinical examination showed left wrist synovitis and no fever. The arthritis occurred a few days after an accidental fall on wet asphalt responsible for a cutaneous wound followed by a corticosteroid intra-articular injection. Due to both the negativity of conventional culture of articular fluid and suspicion of infection, 16S rRNA and specific PCRs were performed leading to the identification of L. bozemanii. Legionella-specific culture of the articular fluid was performed retrospectively and isolated L. bozemanii. The empiric antibiotic therapy was switched for oral levofloxacin and rifampin and the patient recovered after a 12-week treatment.
CONCLUSION: We report a case of L. bozemanii monoarthritis in an immunosuppressed woman, following a fall on wet asphalt and intra-articular corticosteroid injection. The review of the literature found that the clinical presentation reveals the mode of infection and the bacterial species. Monoarthritis more likely occurred after inoculation in patients under immunosuppressive therapy and were associated with non-Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) strains that predominate in the environment. Polyarthritis were more likely secondary legionellosis localizations after blood spread of Lp1, the most frequently found in pneumonia. In both settings, 16S rRNA and Legionella-specific PCR were key factors for the diagnosis.","['Ibranosyan M', 'Beraud L', 'Lemaire H', 'Ranc AG', 'Ginevra C', 'Jarraud S', 'Descours G']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Ibranosyan M, et al.

31635303,Public Health Risks Associated with Heavy Metal and Microbial Contamination of Drinking Water in Australia.,"Recently in Australia concerns have been raised regarding the contamination of municipal drinking water supplies with lead. This is of particular concern to children due to the impact of lead exposure on cognitive development and as such these findings have received much media attention. The response from legislators has been swift, and The Victorian School Building Authority has announced that all new schools and school upgrade works will only use lead-free tapware and piping systems. However, while the immediate replacement of lead-containing brass fittings may seem a logical and obvious response, it does not consider the potential implications on microbial contamination. This is particularly concerning given the increasing public health threat posed by opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens (OPPPs). This commentary explores this public health risk of lead exposure from plumbing materials compared to the potential public health risks from OPPPs. Non-tuberculous mycobacterium was chosen as the example OPPP, and the influence on plumbing material and its public health burden in Australia is explored. This commentary highlights the need for future research into the influence of plumbing material on OPPPs prior to any changes in legislation regarding plumbing material.","['Molino PJ', 'Bentham R', 'Higgins MJ', 'Hinds J', 'Whiley H']",2019,16,20,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Molino PJ, et al.

31614239,Can incorporation of UVC LEDs into showerheads prevent opportunistic respiratory pathogens? - Microbial behavior and device design considerations.,"Respiratory infections from opportunistic bacterial pathogens (OBPs) have heightened research interests in drinking water distribution systems, premise plumbing, and point-of-use technologies. In particular, biofilm growth in showerheads increases OBP content, and inhalation of shower aerosols is a major exposure route for Legionellae and Mycobacteria infections. Incorporation of UVC LEDs into showerheads has thus been proposed as a point-of-use option for healthcare facilities. Herein we have examined incongruities between the nature of OBP contamination in shower water and the hypothetical application of conventional UV disinfection engineering concepts. Effective UV dosing within showerheads must overcome significant shielding effects imparted by the biological matrices in which common OBPs reside, including biofilm particles and protozoan hosts. Furthermore, prevention of biofilm growth in showerhead interiors requires a different UV irradiation approach and is lacking in established design parameters. Development of showerhead devices is also likely to face a trade-off between bathing functionality and simpler form factors that are more conducive to internal UV irradiation.","['Cates EL', 'Torkzadeh H']",2020,168,,Water Res,Cates EL and Torkzadeh H.

31600856,Lightening in a bottle: comparison of ultraviolet light to traditional sterilization in saline irrigations bottles.,"BACKGROUND: Nasal saline irrigations (NSIs) are commonplace in treatment of patients with sinonasal disorders. Contamination of both the water source and delivery bottle remains a challenge with this therapy. The goal of this study was to optimize a disinfection technique with various methods of preparation, disinfection, and delivery of NSIs.
METHODS: Distilled and tap water sources in NSI bottles were contaminated by 4 bacterial strains: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila. Contaminated bottles were cleaned with tap water, tap water with detergent, or microwave and swabbed for culture. Water-source disinfection was performed with reverse osmosis, distillation, activated carbon filtration, boiling, or ultraviolet (UV) light treatment. Test samples from each experimental group (n = 3/group) were cultivated on the appropriate media with colony-forming units (CFUs) reported.
RESULTS: All methods of bottle cleaning with tap water with/without detergent and microwave significantly reduced bacterial load (CFUs) by >99% (p < 0.05). Distillation and boiling of the contaminated water source eliminated 100% of bacteria, whereas reverse osmosis and activated carbon filtration did not. A single UV treatment of contaminated water within a bottle eliminated 99% of bacteria within the water and 100% in the bottle.
CONCLUSION: Cleansing of NSI bottles with tap water with/without detergent or microwave produced robust bacterial disinfection. Distillation and boiling of a contaminated water source completely eliminated all bacteria. UV light treatment was capable of simultaneous disinfection of both the water source and bottle, suggesting this may be a convenient, 1-step method of preparing NSIs for patients.","['Husain Q', 'Banks C', 'Woodworth BA', 'Bleier BS']",2020,10,1,Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,"Husain Q, et al.

31576744,NosP Modulates Cyclic-di-GMP Signaling in Legionella pneumophila.,"Biofilms form when bacteria adhere to a surface and secrete an extracellular polymeric substance. Bacteria embedded within a biofilm benefit from increased resistance to antibiotics, host immune responses, and harsh environmental factors. Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that can modulate communal behavior, including biofilm formation, in many bacteria. In many cases, NO-induced biofilm dispersal is accomplished through signal transduction pathways that ultimately lead to a decrease in intracellular cyclic-di-GMP levels. H-NOX (heme nitric oxide/oxygen binding domain) proteins are the best characterized bacterial NO sensors and have been implicated in NO-mediated cyclic-di-GMP signaling, but we have recently discovered a second family of NO-sensitive proteins in bacteria named NosP (NO sensing protein); to date, a clear link between NosP signaling and cyclic-di-GMP metabolism has not been established. Here we present evidence that NosP (Lpg0279) binds to NO and directly affects cyclic-di-GMP production from two-component signaling proteins Lpg0278 and Lpg0277 encoded within the NosP operon.

Our recent studies revealed that climatic parameters can increase the number of reported cases of community-acquired Legionnaires' disease. Here, we evaluated the presence of Legionella in water networks and the distribution of Legionnaires' disease cases associated with touristic-recreational facilities in the Apulia region (southern Italy) during the period 2001-2017 using geostatistical and climatic analyses. Geostatistical analysis data revealed that the area with the highest concentration of Legionella in water systems also had the greatest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with touristic-recreational facilities. Climatic analysis showed that higher daily temperature excursion (difference between maximum and minimum temperature) on the day of sampling was more often associated with Legionella-positive samples than Legionella-negative samples. In addition, our data highlighted an increased risk of Legionnaires' disease with increases in precipitation and average temperature and with decreases in daily temperature excursion (difference between maximum and minimum temperature over the course of 24 h in the days of incubation period of disease) and minimum temperature. Healthcare professionals should be aware of this phenomenon and be particularly vigilant for cases of community-acquired pneumonia during such climatic conditions and among the tourist population.

Using this optimized protocol, identification of peptides and proteins for different Gram-positive and Gram-negative species can be dramatically increased and, reliable quantification can also be ensured. This adapted method is compared to already established strain-specific sample processing protocols for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus suis, and Legionella pneumophila. The highest species-specific increase in identifications is observed using the adapted method with L. pneumophila samples by increasing protein and peptide identifications up to 300% and 620%, respectively. This increase is accompanied by an improvement in reproducibility of protein quantification and data completeness between replicates.

31525518,A real-time PCR for specific detection of the Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 ST1 complex.,"OBJECTIVE: Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) sequence type (ST) 1 is globally widespread in the environment and accounts for a significant proportion of Legionella infections, including nosocomial Legionnaires' disease (LD). This study aimed to design a sensitive and specific detection method for Lp ST1 that will underpin epidemiological investigations and risk assessment.
METHODS: A total of 628 Lp genomes (126 ST1s) were analyzed by comparative genomics. Interrogation of more than 900 accessory genes revealed seven candidate targets for specific ST1 detection and specific primers and hydrolysis probes were designed and evaluated. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the seven primer and probe sets were evaluated on serially diluted DNA extracted from the reference strain CIP107629 and via qPCR applied on 200 characterized isolates. The diagnostic performance of the assay was evaluated on 142 culture-proven clinical samples from LD cases and a real-life investigation of a case cluster.
RESULTS: Of seven qPCR assays that underwent analytical validation, one PCR target (lpp1868) showed higher sensitivity and specificity for ST1 and ST1-like strains. The diagnostic performance of the assay using respiratory samples corresponded to a sensitivity of 95% (19/20) (95% CI (75.1-99.9)) and specificity of 100% (122/122) (95% CI (97-100)). The ST1 PCR assay could link two out of three culture-negative hospitalized LD cases to ST1 during a real-time investigation.
CONCLUSION: Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, we developed and validated a sensitive and specific qPCR assay for the detection of Lp1 belonging to the ST1 clonal complex by amplification of the lpp1868 gene. The ST1 qPCR is expected to deliver an added value for Lp control and prevention, in conjunction with other recently developed molecular assays.","['Ginevra C', 'Chastang J', 'David S', 'Mentasti M', 'Yakunin E', 'Chalker VJ', 'Chalifa-Caspi V', 'Valinsky L', 'Jarraud S', 'Moran-Gilad J', 'ESCMID Study Group for Legionella Infections (ESGLI)']",2020,26,4,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Ginevra C, et al.

31504472,Evolutionary Dissection of the Dot/Icm System Based on Comparative Genomics of 58 Legionella Species.,"The Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system of Legionella pneumophila is essential for its pathogenesis by delivering >300 effector proteins into the host cell. However, their precise secretion mechanism and which components interact with the host cell is only partly understood. Here, we undertook evolutionary analyses of the Dot/Icm system of 58 Legionella species to identify those components that interact with the host and/or the substrates. We show that high recombination rates are acting on DotA, DotG, and IcmX, supporting exposure of these proteins to the host. Specific amino acids under positive selection on the periplasmic region of DotF, and the cytoplasmic domain of DotM, support a role of these regions in substrate binding. Diversifying selection acting on the signal peptide of DotC suggests its interaction with the host after cleavage. Positive selection acts on IcmR, IcmQ, and DotL revealing that these components are probably participating in effector recognition and/or translocation. Furthermore, our results predict the participation in host/effector interaction of DotV and IcmF. In contrast, DotB, DotO, most of the core subcomplex elements, and the chaperones IcmS-W show a high degree of conservation and not signs of recombination or positive selection suggesting that these proteins are under strong structural constraints and have an important role in maintaining the architecture/function of the system. Thus, our analyses of recombination and positive selection acting on the Dot/Icm secretion system predicted specific Dot/Icm components and regions implicated in host interaction and/or substrate recognition and translocation, which will guide further functional analyses.","['Gomez-Valero L', 'Chiner-Oms A', 'Comas I', 'Buchrieser C']",2019,11,9,Genome Biol Evol,"Gomez-Valero L, et al.

Other Francisella species are known but less is understood about their virulence factors. The role of environmental amoebae in the life-cycle of Francisella is still under discussion. Francisella sp. strain W12-1067 (F-W12) is an environmental Francisella isolate recently identified in Germany which is negative for the Francisella pathogenicity island, but exhibits a putative alternative type VI secretion system. Putative virulence factors have been identified in silico in the genome of F-W12. In this work, we established a ""scatter screen"", used earlier for pathogenic Legionella, to verify experimentally and identify candidate fitness factors using a transposon mutant bank of F-W12 and Acanthamoeba lenticulata as host organism.

31409320,"Immunoglobulin M profile of viral and atypical pathogens among children with community acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Luzhou, China.","BACKGROUND: Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (CA-LRTIs) are the primary cause of hospitalization among children globally. A better understanding of the role of atypical pathogen infections in native conditions is essential to improve clinical management and preventive measures. The main objective of this study was to detect the presence of 7 respiratory viruses and 2 atypical pathogens among hospitalized infants and children with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Luzhou via an IgM test.
METHODS: Overall, 6623 cases of local hospitalized children with 9 pathogen-IgM results from 1st July 2013 to 31st Dec 2016 were included; multidimensional analysis was performed.
RESULTS: 1) Out of 19,467 hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections, 6623 samples were collected, for a submission ratio of 33.96% (6623 /19467). Of the total 6623 serum samples tested, 5784 IgM stains were positive, for a ratio of 87.33% (5784 /6623). Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) was the dominant pathogen (2548 /6623, 38.47%), with influenza B (INFB) (1606 /6623, 24.25%), Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1) (485 /6623, 7.32%) and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3(PIVs) (416 /6623, 6.28%) ranking second, third and fourth, respectively. 2) The distribution of various pathogen-IgM by age group was significantly different (χ
CONCLUSIONS: The dominant positive IgM in the area was MP, followed by INFB, either of which prefers to infect children between 2 years and 5 years in autumn. The presence of atypical pathogens should not be underestimated clinically as they were common infections in the respiratory tract of children in the hospital.","['Chen A', 'Song L', 'Chen Z', 'Luo X', 'Jiang Q', 'Yang Z', 'Hu L', 'He J', 'Zhou L', 'Yu H']",2019,19,1,BMC Pediatr,"Chen A, et al.

31385942,Severe transient left ventricular dysfunction in a patient with Legionella pneumophila pneumonia.,"UNLABELLED: Legionella pneumophila infection (legionellosis) usually presents as a multisystemic disease, predominantly affecting the lungs (Legionnaires' disease - LD). Immunodeficiency, chemotherapy or chronic steroids use increase the risk of developing LD. Extrapulmonary manifestations of LD include cardiac complications: myocarditis, pericarditis or endocarditis.
A CASE REPORT: The authors describe a case of a 51-year-old female with a history of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Sjögren syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was admitted due to a high fever, fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea and cough. Chest X-ray and CT showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrations and pleural effusion. LD was diagnosed on positive L. pneumophila urinary antigen test. Echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with substantially decreased ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain (GLS), with a pattern resembling reverse takotsubo syndrome (rTTS). The coronary arteries in non-invasive coronary angiography were normal. During therapy with levofloxacin and intravenous immunoglobulins as well as with carvedilol, ramipril and diuretics, gradual clinical improvement with complete normalization of LV function was observed within 5 weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) performed on day 35 revealed only small intramural foci of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with localization not corresponding to the most decreased regional longitudinal strain in the initial echocardiographic examination. The authors suggest that the mechanism of transient LV dysfunction in the case presented may have been of complex nature, including LD myocarditis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy (with the prevalence of the latter) which has not so far been reported in the literature.","['Elikowski W', 'Małek-Elikowska M', 'Greberska W', 'Fertała N', 'Zawodna M', 'Marchlewska J', 'Dudziak J']",2019,47,277,Pol Merkur Lekarski,"Elikowski W, et al.

31385671,Legionellosis in Poland in 2017.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the epidemiological situation of legionellosis in Poland in 2017 in comparison with previous years.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis is based on national surveillance data published in the annual bulletin: “Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2017” and bulletins from previous years along with data from legionellosis case reports collected and sent to the Department of Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases and Surveillance NIPH – NIH by Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations.
RESULTS: In Poland, both cases of Legionnaires’ disease (an acute form of infection with pneumonia) and Pontiac fever (a mild, influenza-like form of infection) are routinely reported to the surveillance system. In 2017, a total of 39 cases of legionellosis were registered, including 38 cases of Legionnaires’ disease and 1 case of Pontiac fever; the annual incidence rate 0.102 (per 100,000 population) has increased by almost 50 percent since previous year (0.070) and is almost three times higher than the median incidence (0.036) for 2011-2015. The infections were reported in fourteen voivodeships; only one voivodeship (Świętokrzyskie) did not register any case in last years. The incidence in men (0.129 per 100,000) was higher compared to women (0.076); the highest incidence (0.323) was noted in men aged 50-59. All reported cases were sporadic and were hospitalised. The Sanitary Inspection reported nine fatal cases – 6 women and 3 men. Thirty three cases were autochthonous including four cases linked with contaminated water systems in health-care settings. Six cases were associated with travels abroad (to Egypt, Albania, Italy and Crete).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: Although in recent years number of reported cases continues to rise, the incidence of legionellosis in Poland remains one of the lowest in the entire EU. Also draws attention variation of incidence between provinces and a high mortality among reported cases. Our data suggest significant under-diagnosis of legionellosis. A priority remains to improve early diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease in health care settings.","['Stypulkowska-Misiurewicz H', 'Czerwiński M']",2019,73,2,Przegl Epidemiol,Stypulkowska-Misiurewicz H and Czerwiński M.

31342243,Investigation of atmospheric conditions fostering the spreading of legionnaires' disease in outbreaks related to cooling towers.,"Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a severe lung infection caused by the bacteria Legionella pneumophila which is usually associated with water managing installations like cooling towers. Several outbreaks of LD have been linked to individual sources of bioaerosol in the past. However, the transmission pathways as well as the influence of meteorological factors in the spreading of such bioaerosols remain unclear. Using the meteorological data near 12 LD outbreaks in Europe for the period 2000-2016, the correlation between key meteorological factors and the occurrence of LD was assessed. Temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, precipitation, cloud cover and, for the first time, fog occurrence were included as potential risk factors. It was found that the occurrence of fog was related to four of the LD outbreaks, suggesting that the presence of fog droplets and/or the thermal inversions associated with fog may play a role in the disease spreading. This finding can contribute to outbreak investigations and to the prevention of future outbreaks.","['Villanueva D', 'Schepanski K']",2019,63,10,Int J Biometeorol,Villanueva D and Schepanski K.

METHODS: Seventy-nine isolates of L. pneumophila were collected from environmental and clinical sources, including cooling towers, hot springs, bath water, fountains, and patients, and identified with 16S rRNA gene analysis and serum agglutination assay. The isolates were then typed by Sequence-Based Typing (SBT), and Genotyping of forty-two LP1 strains were analyzed by means of multiple-locus VNTR analysis with 8 loci (MLVA-8). All strains were further analyzed for two virulence genes: Legionella vir homologue (lvh) and repeats in structural toxin (rtxA). The intracellular growth ability of 33 selected isolates was determined by examining their interaction with J774 cells.
RESULTS: All isolates were identified to L. pneumophila including 11 serogroups, among which the main serogroup were LP1, accounting for 54.43%. Thirty-three different sequence types (STs) from five main clonal groups and five singletons were identified, along with 8 different MLVA patterns.

31313992,Colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa of dental unit waterlines and its relationship with other bacteria: suggestions for microbiological monitoring.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental bacterium, ubiquitous in aquatic habitats and water distribution systems, including dental unit waterlines (DUWLs). We investigated the prevalence of P. aeruginosa in DUWLs from private dental settings. We also analyzed the relationship between P. aeruginosa contamination and the presence of Legionella spp. and total viable count (TVC) in order to suggest a simple and inexpensive protocol to test the quality of water from DUWLs. We detected and quantified P. aeruginosa both by culture and by a PMA (propidium monoazide)-qPCR method. Overall, we detected P. aeruginosa in 17 samples using the PMA-qPCR and in 11 samples using the culture. All culture-positive samples were positive with the PMA-qPCR too, with an agreement between the two methods of 93% and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of κ = 0.747 (good concordance). Comparing results with results of our previous study, we noted that (a) P. aeruginosa was isolated only from DUWLs with high TVC and (b) five out of six Legionella-positive samples were negative for Pseudomonas spp. Our final suggestion is that the cleanliness of DUWLs should be assessed by TVC because it is a good indicator of the presence of pathogens such as Legionella spp. and P. aeruginosa.","['Ditommaso S', 'Giacomuzzi M', 'Ricciardi E', 'Memoli G', 'Zotti CM']",2019,17,4,J Water Health,"Ditommaso S, et al.

31304634,In situ imaging of the bacterial flagellar motor disassembly and assembly processes.,"The self-assembly of cellular macromolecular machines such as the bacterial flagellar motor requires the spatio-temporal synchronization of gene expression with proper protein localization and association of dozens of protein components. In Salmonella and Escherichia coli, a sequential, outward assembly mechanism has been proposed for the flagellar motor starting from the inner membrane, with the addition of each new component stabilizing the previous one. However, very little is known about flagellar disassembly. Here, using electron cryo-tomography and sub-tomogram averaging of intact Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shewanella oneidensis cells, we study flagellar motor disassembly and assembly in situ. We first show that motor disassembly results in stable outer membrane-embedded sub-complexes. These sub-complexes consist of the periplasmic embellished P- and L-rings, and bend the membrane inward while it remains apparently sealed. Additionally, we also observe various intermediates of the assembly process including an inner-membrane sub-complex consisting of the C-ring, MS-ring, and export apparatus. Finally, we show that the L-ring is responsible for reshaping the outer membrane, a crucial step in the flagellar assembly process.","['Kaplan M', 'Subramanian P', 'Ghosal D', 'Oikonomou CM', 'Pirbadian S', 'Starwalt-Lee R', 'Mageswaran SK', 'Ortega DR', 'Gralnick JA', 'El-Naggar MY', 'Jensen GJ']",2019,38,14,EMBO J,"Kaplan M, et al.

Active, well-planned clinical and environmental surveillance in hospitals is the most important instrument of prevention.
AIMS AND METHODS: The aim of the present article was to outline the state of the art in legionellosis control and prevention among Italian health care facilities by reporting some experiences in the field.
RESULTS: Our results showed that Legionella spp. are largely reported as both hospital water system contaminants and etiological agents in water-related health care-associated infections (HCAI) in Italy. Among the numerous sources of HCAI, water is the most investigated, although it has been demonstrated that air sampling may provide additional information for risk assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: More appropriate risk assessment is needed, especially in large facilities. In addition, more sensitive diagnostic tests should be used and dedicated training courses should be implemented in health care facilities.","['Napoli C', 'De Giglio O', 'Bertamino E', 'Montagna MT']",2019,31,5,Ann Ig,"Napoli C, et al.

31273307,Characterization of bacterial communities in wastewater with enhanced taxonomic resolution by full-length 16S rRNA sequencing.,"Wastewater treatment is crucial to environmental hygiene in urban environments. However, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) collect chemicals, organic matter, and microorganisms including pathogens and multi-resistant bacteria from various sources which may be potentially released into the environment via WWTP effluent. To better understand microbial dynamics in WWTPs, we characterized and compared the bacterial community of the inflow and effluent of a WWTP in Berlin, Germany using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences, which allowed for species level determination in many cases and generally resolved bacterial taxa. Significantly distinct bacterial communities were identified in the wastewater inflow and effluent samples. Dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) varied both temporally and spatially. Disease associated bacterial groups were efficiently reduced in their relative abundance from the effluent by the WWTP treatment process, except for Legionella and Leptospira species which demonstrated an increase in relative proportion from inflow to effluent. This indicates that WWTPs, while effective against enteric bacteria, may enrich and release other potentially pathogenic bacteria into the environment. The taxonomic resolution of full-length 16S rRNA genes allows for improved characterization of potential pathogenic taxa and other harmful bacteria which is required to reliably assess health risk.","['Numberger D', 'Ganzert L', 'Zoccarato L', 'Mühldorfer K', 'Sauer S', 'Grossart HP', 'Greenwood AD']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Numberger D, et al.

31268152,Legionnaires' Disease Mortality in Guinea Pigs Involves the p45 Mobile Genomic Element.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella can cause Legionnaires' disease, a potentially fatal form of pneumonia that occurs as sporadic epidemics. Not all strains display the same propensity to cause disease in humans. Because Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is responsible for >85% of infections, the majority of studies have examined this serogroup, but there are 3 commonly used laboratory strains: L pneumophila serogroup 1 Philadelphia (Phil-1)-derived strains JR32 and Lp01 and 130b-derived strain AA100.
METHODS: We evaluated the ability of Phil-1, JR32, Lp01, and AA100 to cause disease in guinea pigs.
RESULTS: We found that, although Phil-1, JR32, and AA100 cause an acute pneumonia and death by 4 days postinfection (100%), strain Lp01 does not cause mortality (0%). We also noted that Lp01 lacks a mobile element, designated p45, whose presence correlates with virulence. Transfer of p45 into Lp01 results in recovery of the ability of this strain to cause mortality, leads to more pronounced disease, and correlates with increased interferon-γ levels in the lungs and spleens before death.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest a mechanism of Legionnaires' disease pathogenesis due to the presence of type IVA secretion systems that cause higher mortality due to overinduction of a proinflammatory response in the host.","['Christensen LM', 'Sule P', 'Cirillo SLG', 'Strain M', 'Plumlee Q', 'Adams LG', 'Cirillo JD']",2019,220,10,J Infect Dis,"Christensen LM, et al.

31252216,"Intracellular parasitism, the driving force of evolution of Legionella pneumophila and the genus Legionella.","Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen that causes a severe pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease that is often fatal when not promptly diagnosed and treated. Legionella parasitize aquatic protozoa with which it co-evolved over an evolutionary long time. The close relationship between hosts and pathogens, their co-evolution, led to molecular interactions such as the exchange of genetic material through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Genome sequencing of L. pneumophila and of the entire genus Legionella that comprises over 60 species revealed that Legionellae have co-opted genes and thus cellular functions from their eukaryotic hosts to a surprisingly high extent. Acquisition and loss of these eukaryotic-like genes and domains is an on-going process underlining the highly dynamic nature of the Legionella genomes. Although the large amount and diversity of HGT in Legionella seems to be unique in the prokaryotic world the analyses of more and more genomes from environmental organisms and symbionts of amoeba revealed that such genetic exchanges occur among all amoeba associated bacteria and also among the different microorganisms that infect amoeba. This dynamic reshuffling and gene-acquisition has led to the emergence of Legionella as human pathogen and may lead to the emergence of new human pathogens from the environment.","['Gomez-Valero L', 'Buchrieser C']",2019,21,5-6,Microbes Infect,"Gomez-Valero L and Buchrieser C.

The NAIP5/NLRC4 inflammasome detects bacterial flagellin and is essential for resistance to the flagellated intracellular bacterium Legionella pneumophila. The effectors required downstream of NAIP5/NLRC4 to restrict bacterial replication remain unclear. Upon NAIP5/NLRC4 activation, CASP1 cleaves and activates the pore-forming protein Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) and the effector caspase-7 (CASP7). However, Casp1-/- (and Casp1/11-/-) mice are only partially susceptible to L. pneumophila and do not phenocopy Nlrc4-/-mice, because NAIP5/NLRC4 also activates CASP8 for restriction of L. pneumophila infection. Here we show that CASP8 promotes the activation of CASP7 and that Casp7/1/11-/- and Casp8/1/11-/- mice recapitulate the full susceptibility of Nlrc4-/- mice. Gsdmd-/- mice exhibit only mild susceptibility to L. pneumophila, but Gsdmd-/-Casp7-/- mice are as susceptible as the Nlrc4-/- mice.

31246988,Legionella pneumophila p45 element influences host cell entry and sensitivity to sodium.,"Legionella pneumophila are environmental bacteria found ubiquitously in both natural and man-made water reservoirs, sometimes as constituents of biofilm communities, but mostly intracellularly within protozoal hosts. In the event that Legionella become aerosolized in water droplets and inhaled by humans, they can cause a potentially fatal form of pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. Strains of L. pneumophila have highly plastic genomes that harbor numerous inter- and intra-genomic elements, enhancing their ability to live under diverse environmental conditions. One such mobile genomic element, p45 carries ~45 kbp of genes, including the Lvh (Legionella Vir homolog) type IVa secretion system. This element was evaluated for its contribution to L. pneumophila environmental resilience and virulence-related characteristics by comparing clinically isolated strain Philadelphia-1 that carries p45, Lp01 that lacks p45, and Lp01 with p45 reintroduced, Lp01+p45.

31242293,Slowly or Nonresolving Legionnaires' Disease: Case Series and Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND: Rarely, Legionnaires' disease (LD) can progress into a slowly or nonresolving form.
METHODS: A nationwide retrospective study was conducted by the French National Reference Center for Legionella (2013-2017) including cases of slowly or nonresolving LD defined as persistent clinical symptoms, computed tomography (CT) scan abnormalities, and Legionella detection in lower respiratory tract specimens by culture and/or real-time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) >30 days after symptom onset.
RESULTS: Twelve cases of community-acquired slowly or nonresolving LD were identified among 1686 cases of culture-positive LD. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 63 (29-82) years. Ten (83.3%) patients had ≥1 immunosuppressive factor. Clinically, 9 patients transiently recovered before further deterioration (median [IQR] symptom-free interval, 30 [18-55] days), 3 patients had uniformly persistent symptoms (median [IQR] time, 48 [41.5-54] days). Two patients had >2 recurrences. CT scan imagery found lung abscess in 5 (41.6%) cases. Slowly or nonresolving LD was diagnosed on positive Legionella cultures (n = 10, 83.3%) at 49.5 (IQR, 33.7-79) days. Two cases were documented through positive Legionella RT PCR at 52 and 53 days (cycle threshold detection of 21.5 and 33.7, respectively). No genomic microevolution and no Legionella resistance to antibiotics were detected. The median (IQR) duration of treatment was 46.5 (21-92.5) days. Two empyema cases required thoracic surgery. At a median (IQR) follow-up of 26 (14-41.5) months, LD-attributable mortality was 16.6% (n = 2).

To clarify this discrepancy, we analysed the results of mandatory water sample testing conducted as part of risk assessments in 206 buildings in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2015. Of the 6171 samples analysed, 16.2% exceeded the Dutch drinking water standard for Legionella spp. of 100 CFU/litre. In buildings with ≤50 tap points, the average percentage of samples containing ≥100 CFU/litre was 28.2%, and from buildings with >50 tap points, it was 12.2%. Analysis of serial samples (taken every 6 months) from each building showed that 33.2% of all buildings tested positive for at least one sample every 6 months. The overall increase was 4.4% per year. Analysis of Legionella subgroups showed that while the majority of positive samples contained L. non-pneumophila (96.9%), some samples did contain L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (1.0%) and serogroups 2-14 (2.1%). Our data suggest that the Dutch mandatory risk assessment and drinking water management plan is not sufficiently effective in preventing the proliferation of Legionella spp. and may even contribute to proliferation.

31223008,[Colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip for rapid detection of Haemophilus influenzae].,"To establish a novel colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) for rapid, sensitive and accurate detection of Haemophilus influenzae infection by using the outer membrane protein P6 as detection target. First, the linear antigen epitope located in the extracellular domain of the P6 protein (GenBank accession number: AGH02799) was predicted by bioinformatics analysis. The region (62-75 aa of the protein) with strong antigen specificity was chosen and synthesized. Two rabbits were then immunized by the polypeptides (14 aa) for production of polyclonal antibodies. Then, the recombinant P6 proteins were also obtained to produce polyclonal antibodies. Finally, based on the two antibodies, a novel colloidal GICA for detection of Haemophilus influenzae infection was established and the specificity, sensitivity, repeatability and stability of this method were evaluated. At the same time, the method was tested in clinical simulation, and the plate culture method was used to verify its accuracy. The test strip for Haemophilus influenzae infection was successfully prepared. The detection limit of the test strip was as low as 1×105 CFU/mL and the whole process can be completed within 15 minutes. The strip specifically recognized Haemophilus influenzae and did not react with nine of other common respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and Legionella pneumophila. And the strips could be stored at 25 °C for at least 6 months without losing sensitivity or specificity. The coincidence rate between the results of 200 clinical samples and the plate culture method was 90.5%. Haemophilus influenzae protein P6, which possessed a high degree of surface antigen accessibility and antigencity, could be used as a marker for Haemophilus influenzae detection. The immunochromatographic colloidal gold test strip which bears the features of rapidity, convenience and sensitivity provides a unique tool for the on-site surveillance and diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae infection in clinical test.","['Tao Y', 'Hao H', 'Li J', 'Wang M', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang G', 'Hu Z']",2019,35,5,Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,"Tao Y, et al.

31196812,The burden of Legionnaires' disease in New Zealand (LegiNZ): a national surveillance study.,"BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease is under-diagnosed because of inconsistent use of diagnostic tests and uncertainty about whom to test. We assessed the increase in case detection following large-scale introduction of routine PCR testing of respiratory specimens in New Zealand.
METHODS: LegiNZ was a national surveillance study done over 1-year in which active case-finding was used to maximise the identification of cases of Legionnaires' disease in hospitals. Respiratory specimens from patients of any age with pneumonia, who could provide an eligible lower respiratory specimen, admitted to one of 20 participating hospitals, covering a catchment area of 96% of New Zealand's population, were routinely tested for legionella by PCR. Additional cases of Legionnaires' disease in hospital were identified through mandatory notification.
FINDINGS: Between May 21, 2015, and May 20, 2016, 5622 eligible specimens from 4862 patients were tested by PCR. From these, 197 cases of Legionnaires' disease were detected. An additional 41 cases were identified from notification data, giving 238 cases requiring hospitalisation. The overall incidence of Legionnaires' disease cases in hospital in the study area was 5·4 per 100 000 people per year, and Legionella longbeachae was the predominant cause, found in 150 (63%) of 238 cases.
INTERPRETATION: The rate of notified disease during the study period was three-times the average over the preceding 3 years. Active case-finding through systematic PCR testing better clarified the regional epidemiology of Legionnaires' disease and uncovered an otherwise hidden burden of disease. These data inform local Legionnaires' disease testing strategies, allow targeted antibiotic therapy, and help identify outbreaks and effective prevention strategies. The same approach might have similar benefits if applied elsewhere in the world.

31195295,DVC-FISH to identify potentially pathogenic Legionella inside free-living amoebae from water sources.,"Despite all safety efforts, drinking and wastewater can still be contaminated by Legionella and free-living amoebae (FLA) since these microorganisms are capable of resisting disinfection treatments. An amoebae cyst harboring pathogenic Legionella spp. can be a transporter of this organism, protecting it and enhancing its infection abilities. Therefore, the aim of this work is to identify by DVC-FISH viable Legionella spp and Legionella pneumophila cells inside FLA from water sources in a specific and rapid way with the aim of assessing the real risk of these waters. A total of 55 water samples were processed, 30 reclaimed wastewater and 25 drinking water. FLA presence was detected in 52.7% of the total processed water samples. When DVC-FISH technique was applied, the presence of viable internalized Legionella spp. cells was identified in 69.0% of the total FLA-positive samples, concretely in 70.0% and 66.7% of wastewater and drinking water samples, respectively. L. pneumophila was simultaneously identified in 48.3% of the total FLA-positive samples, specifically in 50.0% and 44.4% of wastewater and drinking water samples, respectively. By culture, potentially pathogenic Legionella cells were recovered in 27.6% of the total FLA-positive bacteria, particularly in 35.0% and 11.1% of wastewater and drinking water samples, respectively. These findings demonstrate that FLA may promote resistance of bacteria to the performed disinfection treatments for drinking as well as for wastewater. So, in addition to the risk for the presence of pathogenic FLA in water it is necessary to take into account that these can be transporters of the pathogenic bacteria Legionella, which are able to survive inside them. The DVC-FISH method described here has been proved to be a rapid and specific tool to identify pathogenic Legionella spp. and L. penumophila viable cells harboured by FLA in these water sources, posing particular public health concern.","['Moreno Y', 'Moreno-Mesonero L', 'García-Hernández J']",2019,176,,Environ Res,"Moreno Y, et al.

31166887,"Assessing the impact, genomics and evolution of type II secretion across a large, medically important genus: the Legionella type II secretion paradigm.","The type II secretion system (T2SS) plays a major role in promoting bacterial survival in the environment and in human hosts. One of the best characterized T2SS is that of Legionella pneumophila, the agent of Legionnaires' disease. Secreting at least 25 proteins, including degradative enzymes, eukaryotic-like proteins and novel effectors, this T2SS contributes to the ability of L. pneumophila to grow at low temperatures, infect amoebal and macrophage hosts, damage lung tissue, evade the immune system, and undergo sliding motility. The genes encoding the T2SS are conserved across the genus Legionella, which includes 62 species and >30 pathogens in addition to L. pneumophila. The vast majority of effectors associated with L. pneumophila are shared by a large number of Legionella species, hinting at a critical role for them in the ecology of Legionella as a whole. However, no other species has the same repertoire as L. pneumophila, with, as a general rule, phylogenetically more closely related species sharing similar sets of effectors. T2SS effectors that are involved in infection of a eukaryotic host(s) are more prevalent throughout Legionella, indicating that they are under stronger selective pressure. The Legionella T2SS apparatus is closest to that of Aquicella (another parasite of amoebae), and a significant number of L. pneumophila effectors have their closest homologues in Aquicella. Thus, the T2SS of L. pneumophila probably originated within the order Legionellales, with some of its effectors having arisen within that Aquicella-like progenitor, while other effectors derived from the amoebal host, mimiviruses, fungi and less closely related bacteria.","['White RC', 'Cianciotto NP']",2019,5,6,Microb Genom,"White RC and Cianciotto NP.

Clusters vary in size and scope, are associated with a diverse range of aerosol-producing devices, including exposures such as whirlpool spas and hotel water systems typically associated with travel, and can occur without an easily identified exposure source. Recently, jurisdictions have begun to use SaTScan spatio-temporal analysis software prospectively as part of routine cluster surveillance. We used data collected by the Active Bacterial Core surveillance platform to assess the ability of SaTScan to detect Legionnaires' disease clusters. We found that SaTScan analysis using traditional surveillance data and geocoded residential addresses was unable to detect many common Legionnaires' disease cluster types, such as those associated with travel or a prolonged time between cases. Additionally, signals from an analysis designed to simulate a real-time search for clusters did not align with clusters identified by traditional surveillance methods or a retrospective SaTScan analysis. A geospatial analysis platform better tailored to the unique characteristics of Legionnaires' disease epidemiology would improve cluster detection and decrease time to public health action.","['Edens C', 'Alden NB', 'Danila RN', 'Fill MA', 'Gacek P', 'Muse A', 'Parker E', 'Poissant T', 'Ryan PA', 'Smelser C', ""Tobin-D'Angelo M"", 'Schrag SJ']",2019,14,5,PLoS One,"Edens C, et al.

31125730,Can bacterial indicators of a grassy woodland restoration inform ecosystem assessment and microbiota-mediated human health?,"Understanding how microbial communities change with environmental degradation and restoration may offer new insights into the understudied ecology that connects humans, microbiota, and the natural world. Immunomodulatory microbial diversity and 'Old Friends' are thought to be supplemented from biodiverse natural environments, yet deficient in anthropogenically disturbed or degraded environments. However, few studies have compared the microbiomes of natural vs. human-altered environments and there is little knowledge of which microbial taxa are representative of ecological restoration-i.e. the assisted recovery of degraded ecosystems typically towards a more natural, biodiverse state. Here we use novel bootstrap-style resampling of site-level soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene environmental DNA data to identify genus-level indicators of restoration from a 10-year grassy eucalypt woodland restoration chronosequence at Mt Bold, South Australia. We found two key indicator groups emerged: 'opportunistic taxa' that decreased in relative abundance with restoration and more stable and specialist, 'niche-adapted taxa' that increased. We validated these results, finding seven of the top ten opportunists and eight of the top ten niche-adapted taxa displayed consistent differential abundance patterns between human-altered vs. natural samples elsewhere across Australia. Extending this, we propose a two-dimensional mapping for ecosystem condition based on the proportions of these divergent indicator groups. We also show that restoring a more biodiverse ecosystem at Mt Bold has increased the potentially immune-boosting environmental microbial diversity. Furthermore, environmental opportunists including the pathogen-containing genera Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, Legionella and Pseudomonas associated with disturbed ecosystems. Our approach is generalizable with potential to inform DNA-based methods for ecosystem assessment and help target environmental interventions that may promote microbiota-mediated human health gains.","['Liddicoat C', 'Weinstein P', 'Bissett A', 'Gellie NJC', 'Mills JG', 'Waycott M', 'Breed MF']",2019,129,,Environ Int,"Liddicoat C, et al.

However, their monitoring is not required in current water potability standards and they have been poorly studied in a full-scale network. In this study, we quantified, by qPCR, three opportunistic pathogens, Mycobacterium spp., Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa throughout the Paris drinking water network over a one-year sampling campaign. While Mycobacteria spp. seemed ubiquitous whatever the distribution system and the time of the year, the occurrence of L. pneumophila and P. aeruginosa showed seasonal variations.

The variation in microbial numbers did not demonstrate any correlations with temperature, pH, chlorine, conductivity, orthophosphate or nitrate levels. In conclusion, Mycobacterium spp. are common inhabitants of the Paris network while L. pneumophila and P. aeruginosa presence fluctuate over space and time.

31074841,Two sequential layers of antibody-mediated control of Legionella pneumophila infection.,"Protective immunity against intracellular pathogens, including bacteria, usually relies on cellular immunity. However, antibodies are also implicated in mediating protection against intracellular bacteria. In case of airway infection with Legionella pneumophila (Lpn), the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, pre-existing Lpn-specific antibodies were shown to afford protection within two days of infection. Here we dissected the early kinetics of Ab-mediated protection against airway Lpn infection and observed two kinetically and mechanistically distinct phases of protection by passively administered antibodies. Within the first hour of infection, Lpn-opsonizing antibodies provided almost 10-fold protection in an antibody Fc-dependent, but FcR-independent manner. Later on, by two days post infection, Lpn-specific Ab-mediated protection strictly involved FcγR, Syk kinase activity in alveolar macrophages and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The findings presented here contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of Ab-mediated control of Lpn infection in actively or passively immunized individuals.","['Weber SS', 'Stoycheva D', 'Nimmerjahn F', 'Oxenius A']",2019,49,9,Eur J Immunol,"Weber SS, et al.

Although culture was negative, 17 BAL (36%) were positive for Legionella by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, most of which were in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Pneumocystis jirovecii co-infected patients, and included L. anisa (n = 6), L. bozemanae (n = 4), L. pneumophila (n = 3), and L. micdadei (n = 2). All L. bozemanae and L. micdadei associated with Pneumocystis, while all L. pneumophila associated with M. tuberculosis. Legionella probable cases had more complications and higher mortality rates (P = 0.02) and were rarely administered empirical anti-Legionella therapy while in hospital.

31053752,"Intracellular parasitism, the driving force of evolution of Legionella pneumophila and the genus Legionella.","Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen that causes a severe pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease that is often fatal when not promptly diagnosed and treated. However, L. pneumophila is mainly an environmental pathogen of protozoa. This bacterium parasitizes free-living amoeba and other aquatic protozoa with which it co-evolved over an evolutionary long time. Due to the close relationship between hosts and pathogens, their co-evolution leads to molecular interactions such as the exchange of genetic material through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Those genes that confer an advantage to the bacteria were fixed in their genomes and help these pathogens to subvert host functions to their advantage. Genome sequencing of L. pneumophila and recently of the entire genus Legionella that comprises over 60 species revealed that Legionellae have co-opted genes and thus cellular functions from their eukaryotic hosts to a surprisingly high extent never observed before for an prokaryotic organism. Acquisition and loss of these eukaryotic-like genes and eukaryotic domains is an ongoing process underlining the highly dynamic nature of the Legionella genomes. Although the large amount and diversity of HGT that occurred between Legionella and their protozoan hosts seems to be unique in the prokaryotic world, the analyses of more and more genomes from environmental organisms and symbionts of amoeba revealed that such genetic exchanges occur among all amoeba-associated bacteria and also among the different microorganisms that infect amoeba such as viruses. This dynamic reshuffling and gene-acquisition has led to the emergence of major human pathogens such as Legionella and may lead to the emergence of new human pathogens from the environment.","['Gomez-Valero L', 'Buchrieser C']",2019,20,5,Genes Immun,"Gomez-Valero L and Buchrieser C.

31048196,Viability and infectivity of viable but nonculturable Legionella pneumophila strains induced at high temperatures.,"Thermal disinfection is commonly used to prevent the proliferation of culturable Legionella in engineered water systems (EWS). In response to such stress, culturable Legionella populations can switch into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. The importance of such VBNC Legionella cells is currently hotly debated. Here, we investigated the stress response patterns and transitions of the bacteria to the VBNC state at 55 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C on two L. pneumophila strains for >80 days using a combination of cell-based viability indicators. Complete loss of culturability at 55 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C occurred after 3-8 h, 60 min and <2 min, respectively. In contrast, L. pneumophila strains required 9 days at 55 °C, 8 h at 60 °C and 20 min at 70 °C to achieve a 2 log reduction in cells with intact membranes and high esterase activity; a 4 log reduction was achieved only after 150, 8-15 and 1-4 days, respectively. In parallel, the presence of diagnostic outer-membrane epitopes (OMEs) and changes in the infectivity patterns of the two strains towards amoebae and THP-1 cells were assessed. OMEs were more persistent than viability indicators, showing their potential as targets for VBNC Legionella detection. L. pneumophila strains infected amoebae and THP-1 cells for at least 85 days at 55 °C and 60 °C and for up to 8 days at 70 °C. However, they did so with reduced efficiency, requiring prolonged co-incubation times with the hosts and higher Legionella cell numbers in comparison to culturable cells. Consequently, infection of amoebae by thermally induced VBNC L. pneumophila with lowered virulence can be expected in EWS. Although the gold standard method cannot detect VBNC Legionella, it provides important information about the most virulent bacterial subpopulations. Our results indicate that a prolonged thermal regime ≥60 °C at the central parts of warm water systems is not only effective against culturable L. pneumophila but in the long run even against VBNC cells.","['Cervero-Aragó S', 'Schrammel B', 'Dietersdorfer E', 'Sommer R', 'Lück C', 'Walochnik J', 'Kirschner A']",2019,158,,Water Res,"Cervero-Aragó S, et al.

31038127,[Local public health services: a descriptive study of the municipalities of Catalonia in 2016].,"OBJECTIVE: The health system in Spain rests mostly in the Autonomous Communities (similar to the states in the US). The public health activities of many local governments are little studied. The objective of this work was to bring knowledge about the public health activities of the municipalities, providing information obtained from a recent survey in Catalonia.
METHODS: Descriptive study based on a survey to public health officers in the 119 municipalities above 10,000 population in Catalonia, excluding the city of Barcelona. The survey was conducted between May and October 2016, with 103 municipalities (86.6%) reporting on their services in 2015, prior to the survey. Data were collected and descriptive analyses performed.
RESULTS: A consolidation of both political and professional public health structures of the municipalities was observed. Most frequent activities in health protection were related to legionella control, the control of urban pests and the management of complaints and requests by citizens. Most frequent activities in the field of health promotion were related to physical activity and health, prevention in tobacco and alcohol, food and nutrition. There were relatively few changes reported in public health structures and their officers, as well as in human resources.
CONCLUSIONS: In Catalonia, municipalities above 10,000 population have a remarkable level of activity in public health. Both the areas of health protection (with mandatory minimum services for local governments) and of health promotion show high levels of activity. The system seems stable regarding political changes and budget constraints. There are opportunities for improvement in the training of professionals and service accreditation. It would be desirable to find ways to improve coordination among these services.","['Chamorro C', 'Díaz-Echenique L', 'Oliván J', 'Villalbí JR']",2019,93,,Rev Esp Salud Publica,"Chamorro C, et al.

31025623,Manipulation of Host Cell Organelles by Intracellular Pathogens.,"In this article, we explore the unique adaptations of intracellular bacterial pathogens that manipulate conserved cellular pathways, organelles, and cargo to convert the phagosome into a pathogen-containing vacuole (PCV). The phagosome is a degradative organelle that rapidly acidifies as it delivers cargo to the lysosome to destroy microbes and cellular debris. However, to avoid this fate, intracellular bacterial pathogens hijack the key molecular modulators of intracellular traffic: small GTPases, phospholipids, SNAREs, and their associated effectors. Following uptake, pathogens that reside in the phagosome either remain associated with the endocytic pathway or rapidly diverge from the preprogrammed route to the lysosome. Both groups rely on effector-mediated mechanisms to meet the common challenges of intracellular life, such as nutrient acquisition, vacuole expansion, and evasion of the host immune response.

We have developed NestLink, a binder selection and identification technology able to biophysically characterize thousands of library members at once without the need to handle individual clones at any stage of the process. NestLink uses genetically encoded barcoding peptides termed flycodes, which were designed for maximal detectability by mass spectrometry and support accurate deep sequencing. We demonstrate NestLink's capacity to overcome the current limitations of binder-generation methods in three applications. First, we show that hundreds of binder candidates can be simultaneously ranked according to kinetic parameters. Next, we demonstrate deep mining of a nanobody immune repertoire for membrane protein binders, carried out entirely in solution without target immobilization. Finally, we identify rare binders against an integral membrane protein directly in the cellular environment of a human pathogen. NestLink opens avenues for the selection of tailored binder characteristics directly in tissues or in living organisms.","['Egloff P', 'Zimmermann I', 'Arnold FM', 'Hutter CAJ', 'Morger D', 'Opitz L', 'Poveda L', 'Keserue HA', 'Panse C', 'Roschitzki B', 'Seeger MA']",2019,16,5,Nat Methods,"Egloff P, et al.

Electron cryotomography mapped the location of the core and accessory components of the Legionella core transmembrane subcomplex, revealing a well-ordered central channel that opens into a large, windowed secretion chamber with an unusual 13-fold symmetry. Immunofluorescence microscopy deciphered an early-stage assembly process that begins with the targeting of Dot/Icm components to the bacterial poles. Polar targeting of this T4BSS is mediated by two Dot/Icm proteins, DotU and IcmF, that, interestingly, are homologues of the T6SS membrane complex components TssL and TssM, suggesting that the Dot/Icm T4BSS is a hybrid system.

30992549,Antimicrobial agent susceptibilities of Legionella pneumophila MLVA-8 genotypes.,"Legionella pneumophila causes human lung infections resulting in severe pneumonia. High-resolution genotyping of L. pneumophila isolates can be achieved by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA-8). Legionella infections in humans occur as a result of inhalation of bacteria-containing aerosols, thus, our aim was to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities of different MLVA-8 genotypes to ten commonly used antimicrobial agents in legionellosis therapy. Epidemiological cut-off values were determined for all antibiotics. Significant differences were found between the antimicrobial agents' susceptibilities of the three studied environmental genotypes (Gt4, Gt6, and Gt15). Each genotype exhibited a significantly different susceptibility profile, with Gt4 strains (Sequence Type 1) significantly more resistant towards most studied antimicrobial agents. In contrast, Gt6 strains (also Sequence Type 1) were more susceptible to six of the ten studied antimicrobial agents compared to the other genotypes. Our findings show that environmental strains isolated from adjacent points of the same water system, exhibit distinct antimicrobial resistance profiles. These differences highlight the importance of susceptibility testing of Legionella strains. In Israel, the most extensively used macrolide for pneumonia is azithromycin. Our results point at the fact that clarithromycin (another macrolide) and trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole (SXT) were the most effective antimicrobial agents towards L. pneumophila strains. Moreover, legionellosis can be caused by multiple L. pneumophila genotypes, thus, the treatment approach should be the use of combined antibiotic therapy. Further studies are needed to evaluate specific antimicrobial combinations for legionellosis therapy.","['Sharaby Y', 'Nitzan O', 'Brettar I', 'Höfle MG', 'Peretz A', 'Halpern M']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Sharaby Y, et al.

30969279,Implementation of Legionella Prevention Policy in Health Care Facilities: The United States Veterans Health Administration Experience.,"CONTEXT: The Veterans Health Administration requires implementation of Legionella prevention policy in potable water systems at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities across the United States and territories.
PROGRAM: The Veterans Health Administration Central Office program offices with expertise in engineering and clinical aspects of Legionella prevention policy have provided joint, structured on-site assistance to VA medical facilities for consultation on policy implementation. Site visits included review of facility documentation and data, discussions with staff, touring of buildings, and development of recommendations.
IMPLEMENTATION: Information obtained from on-site consultative assistance provided to VA medical facilities from December 2012 through January 2018 was reviewed to identify engineering and clinical challenges and lessons from implementation of Legionella prevention policy in VA health care buildings. Fifteen consultative site visits were conducted during this period regarding implementation of Legionella prevention and validation of effectiveness.
EVALUATION: It was found that implementation of Legionella prevention policy in potable water systems was complex and practices varied for each building. Common implementation challenges included capability of applying engineering controls, water stagnation, and assessment of health care association of Legionella cases. Process challenges included routine verification of actions, methods for assessing environmental validation data, and documentation of requirements. It was found that consistent and data-driven implementation of policy is crucial for an effective program.
DISCUSSION: Guidance and standards documents in the community for Legionella prevention in building water systems are often general in nature, but implementation requires specific decisions and routine assessments and modifications to optimize outcomes. This real-world review of challenges and lessons from a large health care system with a detailed primary Legionella prevention policy informs future development of guidance and policy, both within and external to VA, and can provide insight to other health care facilities planning to implement practices for water safety.","['Ambrose M', 'Kralovic SM', 'Roselle GA', 'Kowalskyj O', 'Rizzo V', 'Wainwright DL', 'Gamage SD']",2020,26,2,J Public Health Manag Pract,"Ambrose M, et al.

Collectively, the T4SSs translocate DNA and monomeric and multimeric protein substrates to bacterial and eukaryotic cell types. T4SSs are composed of two large subfamilies, the conjugation machines and the effector translocators that transmit their cargoes through establishment of direct donor-target cell contacts, and a third small subfamily capable of importing or exporting substrates from or to the milieu. This review summarizes recent mechanistic and structural findings that are shedding new light on how T4SSs have evolved such functional diversity. Translocation signals are now known to be located C terminally or embedded internally in structural folds; these signals in combination with substrate-associated adaptor proteins mediate the docking of specific substrate repertoires to cognate VirD4-like receptors.

Culture, though routinely used to quantify L. pneumophila, has several disadvantages including long turnaround time, low sensitivity, and inter-laboratory variability. In this study, we validated the performance of an on-site quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection system for L. pneumophila in accordance with International Standards Organization Technical Specification 12869:2012. We evaluated specificity, limit of detection and quantification, and calibration curve linearity. Additionally, we evaluated whole system recovery and robustness using samples taken from taps and evaporative cooling towers. We then compared the system's performance against laboratory culture and laboratory qPCR across 53 cooling towers in a 12-week in-field study. We found that concordance between on-site qPCR and culture was both laboratory- and site/sample-dependent. Comparison of laboratory qPCR with on-site qPCR revealed that laboratory results were highly variable and showed little concordance. Some discordance may be explained by time delay between sample collection and testing ('shipping effect') which may lead to inaccurate reporting. Overall, our study highlights the value of on-site qPCR detection of L. pneumophila, demonstrates that laboratories are prone to misreporting results due to shipping effects, and reveals significant discordance between laboratory qPCR and culture.","['Ahmed S', 'Liwak-Muir U', 'Walker D', 'Zoldowski A', 'Mears A', 'Golovan S', 'Mohr S', 'Lem P', 'Harder C']",2019,17,2,J Water Health,"Ahmed S, et al.

30942147,"Investigation of healthcare infection risks from water-related organisms: Summary of CDC consultations, 2014-2017.","OBJECTIVE: Water exposures in healthcare settings and during healthcare delivery can place patients at risk for infection with water-related organisms and can potentially lead to outbreaks. We aimed to describe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) consultations involving water-related organisms leading to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
METHODS: We reviewed internal CDC records from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2017, using water-related terms and organisms, excluding Legionella, to identify consultations that involved potential or confirmed transmission of water-related organisms in healthcare. We determined plausible exposure pathways and routes of transmission when possible.
RESULTS: Of 620 consultations during the study period, we identified 134 consultations (21.6%), with 1,380 patients, that involved the investigation of potential water-related HAIs or infection control lapses with the potential for water-related HAIs. Nontuberculous mycobacteria were involved in the greatest number of investigations (n = 40, 29.9%). Most frequently, investigations involved medical products (n = 48, 35.8%), and most of these products were medical devices (n = 40, 83.3%). We identified a variety of plausible water-exposure pathways, including medication preparation near water splash zones and water contamination at the manufacturing sites of medications and medical devices.
CONCLUSIONS: Water-related investigations represent a substantial proportion of CDC HAI consultations and likely represent only a fraction of all water-related HAI investigations and outbreaks occurring in US healthcare facilities. Water-related HAI investigations should consider all potential pathways of water exposure. Finally, healthcare facilities should develop and implement water management programs to limit the growth and spread of water-related organisms.","['Perkins KM', 'Reddy SC', 'Fagan R', 'Arduino MJ', 'Perz JF']",2019,40,6,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,"Perkins KM, et al.

30935236,Drip irrigation biofouling with treated wastewater: bacterial selection revealed by high-throughput sequencing.,"Clogging of drippers due to the development of biofilms weakens the advantages and impedes the implementation of drip irrigation technology. The objective of this study was to characterise the bacterial community of biofilms that develop in a drip irrigation system supplied with treated wastewater. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons indicated that the bacterial community composition differed between drippers and pipes, mainly due to changes in the abundance of the genus Aquabacterium. Cyanobacteria were found to be involved in the biological fouling of drippers. Moreover, bacterial genera including opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Legionella and Pseudomonas were more abundant in dripper and pipe biofilms than in the incoming water. Some genera such as Pseudomonas were mostly recovered from drippers, while others (ie Bacillus, Brevundimonas) mainly occurred in pipes. Variations in the hydraulic conditions and properties of the materials likely explain the shift in bacterial communities observed between pipes and drippers.","['Lequette K', 'Ait-Mouheb N', 'Wéry N']",2019,35,2,Biofouling,"Lequette K, et al.

30925374,Legionella pneumophila levels and sequence-type distribution in hospital hot water samples from faucets to connecting pipes.,"Recent studies have reported increased levels of Legionella pneumophila (Lp) at points of use compared to levels in primary and secondary components of hot water systems, suggesting possible selection by environmental conditions. In this study, concentrations of Lp in a hospital hot water system were evaluated by profile sampling, collecting successive water samples to determine the prevalence at the faucet (distal) and upstream piping before and after a system intervention to increase temperature. Lp strain diversity was compared between different points of use and different areas of the hot water system (i.e., tap, intermediate piping and main upflow piping). In total, 47 isolates were recovered from 32 positive hot water samples collected from designated taps, showers and recirculation loops; these isolates were subsequently analyzed by sequence-based typing (SBT). Lp levels were comparable between first draw (500 mL) and flushed (2 and 5 min) samples, whereas a decrease was observed in the amount of culturable cells (1 log). Two sequence types (STs) were identified throughout the system. ST378 (sg4/10) was present in 91% of samples, while ST154-like (sg1) was present in 41%; both STs were simultaneously recovered in 34% of samples. Isolated STs displayed comparable tolerance to copper (0.8-5 mg/L) and temperature (55 °C, 1 h) exposure. The ability to replicate within THP1 cells and Acanthamoeba castellanii was similar between the two STs and a comparative environmental outbreak strain. The low Lp diversity and the detection of both Lp sequence types in repeated subsequent samples collected from positive faucets in a hospital wing suggest a minimal impact of the distal conditions on strain selection for the sampled points, as well as a possible adaptation to stressors present in the system, leading to the predominance of a few strains.","['Bédard E', 'Paranjape K', 'Lalancette C', 'Villion M', 'Quach C', 'Laferrière C', 'Faucher SP', 'Prévost M']",2019,156,,Water Res,"Bédard E, et al.

30893701,Identification of MazF Homologue in Legionella pneumophila Which Cleaves RNA at the AACU Sequence.,"MazF is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that is widely conserved in bacteria and archaea. Here, we found an MazF homologue (MazF-lp; LPO-p0114) in Legionella pneumophila. The mazF-lp gene overlaps 14 base pairs with the upstream gene mazE-lp (MazE-lp; LPO-p0115). The induction of mazF-lp caused cell growth arrest, while mazE-lp co-induction recovered cell growth in Escherichia coli. In vivo and in vitro primer extension experiments showed that MazF-lp is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease cleaving RNA at AACU. The endoribonuclease activity of purified MazF-lp was inhibited by purified MazE-lp. We found that MazE-lp and the MazEF-lp complex specifically bind to the palindromic sequence present in the 5'-untranslated region of the mazEF-lp operon. MazE-lp and MazEF-lp both likely function as a repressor for the mazEF-lp operon and for other genes, including icmR, whose gene product functions as a secretion chaperone for the IcmQ pore-forming protein, by specifically binding to the palindromic sequence in 5'-UTR of these genes.","['Shaku M', 'Park JH', 'Inouye M', 'Yamaguchi Y']",2018,28,6,J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol,"Shaku M, et al.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using quantitative PCR, the occurrence and persistence of L. pneumophila, L. pneumophila serogroup (Sg)1 and M. avium were evaluated in drinking water samples from 108 cold water taps (residences: n = 43) and (office buildings: n = 65). Mycobacterium avium, L. pneumophila and L. pneumophila Sg1 were detected 45, 41 and 25% of all structures respectively. Two occurrence patterns were evaluated: sporadic (a single detection from the three samplings) and persistent (detections in two or more of the three samples).
CONCLUSIONS: The micro-organism's occurrence was largely sporadic. Office buildings were prone to microbial persistence independent of building age and square footage. Microbial persistence at residences was observed in those older than 40 years for L. pneumophila and was rarely observed for M. avium. The microbial occurrence was evenly distributed between structure types but there were differences in density and persistence.

A total of 194 patients with ECLS for Legionella pneumophila infection who received ECLS were included in the analysis. Overall survival was 71%. Lower body weight and VA ECLS were associated with lower survival. ECLS complications including central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pulmonary infection, and documented infections were rare but more common among nonsurvivors. Mortality in children (64%) was significantly higher than for adults (27%, p = 0.015). Infants fared very poorly with a mortality of 88%. As demonstrated, ECLS can successfully support patients with severe respiratory failure caused by L. pneumophila infection. Consideration should be given to its use in high-risk pediatric patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure of unclear etiology.

Core genome multi locus sequence typing grouped non-invasive outbreak isolates and isolates obtained from related food samples into a single cluster, but clearly separated genetically close isolates obtained from invasive listeriosis cases. A comparative genomic approach identified a premature stop codon in the chiB gene, encoding one of the two L. monocytogenes chitinases, which clustered with disease outcome. Correction of this premature stop codon in one representative gastroenteritis outbreak isolate restored chitinase production, but effects in infection experiments were not found. While the exact role of chitinases in virulence of L. monocytogenes is still not fully understood, our results now clearly show that ChiB-derived activity is not required to establish L. monocytogenes gastroenteritis in humans.

30850059,Purification and functional characterization of the DUB domain of SdeA.,"Intracellular pathogens like Legionella pneumophila hijack the host ubiquitination network in order to create a facultative niche for their survival by means of effector molecules secreted into the host cell. Some of these effectors function as ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinases, among other types of enzymes. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers from conjugated substrates to regulate various cellular processes. Members of the SidE effector family from the L. pneumophila pathogen harbor multiple functional domains that possess discrete biochemical activities impinging on host ubiquitin signaling. At the N-terminal end of these ~1500-residue proteins is a ~200-residue conserved DUB domain capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and the NEDD8 Ubl. SdeA, a member of the SidE family, plays an important role in intracellular bacterial replication. Downstream domains in this protein also catalyze substrate ubiquitination via a phosphoribosyl linkage. Several mammalian Rab proteins (Rab1, Rab30, and Rab33) have been shown to be targeted. The novel mechanism is independent of the classical E1 and E2 ubiquitin ligation machinery and does not require ATP. The N-terminal DUB domain, which does not appear to affect this ubiquitination activity, but it catalyzes cleavage of three different types of polyubiquitination chains (K11, K48, and K63) commonly found in host cells. This chapter describes methods, including purification of recombinant SdeA (full-length and DUB domain alone), and enzymatic assays that have been utilized to characterize the deubiquitination activity of SdeA.","['Puvar K', 'Iyer S', 'Sheedlo MJ', 'Das C']",2019,618,,Methods Enzymol,"Puvar K, et al.

30850050,Methods to study phosphoribosylated ubiquitin ligation and removal.,"Ubiquitination is a prevalent protein modification catalyzed by E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that activate, conjugate, and ligate, respectively, the ubiquitin protein to substrate protein. In order to establish a mutualistic or parasitic relationship with their eukaryotic hosts, many microorganisms hijack different aspects of the ubiquitination machinery using bacterial proteins that function as E3 ligases or as enzymes that modify E2s or ubiquitin. Recently, the SidE family of effector proteins (SidEs) from the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila was found to catalyze ubiquitination by a mechanism unrelated to the classical three-enzyme cascade. Instead of utilizing ATP, SidEs-catalyzed ubiquitination reactions are energized by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Ubiquitin is first activated by ADP-ribosylation at residue Arg42 to form ADP-ribosylated ubiquitin (ADPR-Ub). ADPR-Ub is then cleaved by an activity conferred by a phosphodiesterase (PDE)-related domain also embedded in the SidE family proteins. ADPR-Ub cleavage is coupled to covalent attachment of phosphoribosylated ubiquitin to serine residues of target proteins and the release of AMP. Furthermore, SidE-induced ubiquitination can be reversed by SidJ, another virulence factor from L. pneumophila. Here, we describe the experimental details for SdeA-induced ubiquitination of the small GTPase Rab33b and its reversal by SidJ.","['Qiu J', 'Luo ZQ']",2019,618,,Methods Enzymol,Qiu J and Luo ZQ.

The aim of this study was to investigate microbial contamination of water from supplies and dental units before and after the implementation of a protocol for microbial quality improvement and maintenance of dental unit water. The microbial load was evaluated in water from 27 taps and dental units (reservoirs, air-water syringes and highspeed outputs without handpieces) using the PetrifilmT system (total aerobic bacteria and fungi) and conventional culture media (enterobacteria and Legionella spp.).

30827827,A Legionella pneumophila Kinase Phosphorylates the Hsp70 Chaperone Family to Inhibit Eukaryotic Protein Synthesis.,"Legionella pneumophila (L.p.), the microbe responsible for Legionnaires' disease, secretes ∼300 bacterial proteins into the host cell cytosol. A subset of these proteins affects a wide range of post-translational modifications (PTMs) to disrupt host cellular pathways. L.p. has 5 conserved eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr effector kinases, LegK1-4 and LegK7, which are translocated during infection. Using a chemical genetic screen, we identified the Hsp70 chaperone family as a direct host target of LegK4. Phosphorylation of Hsp70s at T495 in the substrate-binding domain disrupted Hsp70's ATPase activity and greatly inhibited its protein folding capacity. Phosphorylation of cytosolic Hsp70 by LegK4 resulted in global translation inhibition and an increase in the amount of Hsp70 on highly translating polysomes. LegK4's ability to inhibit host translation via a single PTM uncovers a role for Hsp70 in protein synthesis and directly links it to the cellular translational machinery.","['Moss SM', 'Taylor IR', 'Ruggero D', 'Gestwicki JE', 'Shokat KM', 'Mukherjee S']",2019,25,3,Cell Host Microbe,"Moss SM, et al.

Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular Gram-positive bacteria and a major cause of food-borne disease. However, important knowledge on the interactions between L. monocytogenes and the immune system is still missing. Here, we report that Listeria DNA is sorted into extracellular vesicles (EVs) in infected cells and delivered to bystander cells to stimulate the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. This was also observed during infections with Francisella tularensis and Legionella pneumophila. We identify the multivesicular body protein MVB12b as a target for TANK-binding kinase 1 phosphorylation, which is essential for the sorting of DNA into EVs and stimulation of bystander cells. EVs from Listeria-infected cells inhibited T-cell proliferation, and primed T cells for apoptosis. Collectively, we describe a pathway for EV-mediated delivery of foreign DNA to bystander cells, and suggest that intracellular bacteria exploit this pathway to impair antibacterial defence.","['Nandakumar R', 'Tschismarov R', 'Meissner F', 'Prabakaran T', 'Krissanaprasit A', 'Farahani E', 'Zhang BC', 'Assil S', 'Martin A', 'Bertrams W', 'Holm CK', 'Ablasser A', 'Klause T', 'Thomsen MK', 'Schmeck B', 'Howard KA', 'Henry T', 'Gothelf KV', 'Decker T', 'Paludan SR']",2019,4,4,Nat Microbiol,"Nandakumar R, et al.

In this work, we present a rapid and simple method for bulk preparation of microarrays on polycarbonate sheets. Succinylated Jeffamine® ED-2003 was screen printed on polycarbonate sheets to create a polyfunctional shielding layer by baking at 100 °C. After microdispension of capture probes (antibodies, oligonucleotides, or small molecules) in a microarray format, chips were assembled with a flow cell from double-sided tape. It was shown that the shielding layer was firmly coated and suppressed unspecific binding of proteins. Universal applicability was demonstrated by transferring established flow-based chemiluminescence microarray measurement principles from glass slides to polycarbonate chips without loss of analytical performance. Higher chemiluminescence signals could be generated by performing heterogeneous asymmetric recombinase polymerase amplification on polycarbonate chips. Similar results could be shown for sandwich microarray immunoassays.

METHODS: The studies reporting L. pneumophila prevalence in Iranian clinical samples that were published between January 2000 and July 2016 were recruited. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software (version 3.3.070) was used for quantitative data analysis. Because of high heterogeneity between the studies according to the Cochrane Q and I
RESULTS: Sixteen studies encompassing 1956 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of L. pneumophila was 9.6% in clinical samples obtained from the Iranian patients. The age spectrum ranged from 6 months to 80 years old. Dyspnea and cough comprised the most common clinical manifestations. In the subgroup analysis, the prevalence of L. pneumophila was higher in studies with sample size ≤100 (12.9%) in comparison with studies with sample size >100 (8.4%). In addition, the prevalence of L. pneumophila was higher in the years 2009-2016 (9.2%) compared with 2000-2008 (0.7%).

30702192,The Legionella pneumophila effector WipA disrupts host F-actin polymerisation by hijacking phosphotyrosine signalling.,"The major virulence determinant of Legionella pneumophila is the type IVB secretion system (T4BSS), which delivers approximately 330 effector proteins into the host cell to modulate various cellular processes. However, the functions of most effector proteins remain unclear. WipA, an effector, was the first phosphotyrosine phosphatase of Legionella with unknown function. In this study, we found that WipA induced relatively strong growth defects in yeast in a phosphatase activity-dependent manner. Phosphoproteomics data showed that WipA was likely involved into endocytosis, FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, tight junction, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways. Western blotting further confirmed WipA dephosphorylates several proteins associated with actin polymerisation, such as p-N-WASP, p-ARP3, p-ACK1, and p-NCK1. Thus, we hypothesised that WipA targets N-WASP/ARP2/3 complex signalling pathway, leading to disturbance of actin polymerisation. Indeed, we demonstrated that WipA inhibits host F-actin polymerisation by reducing the G-actin to F-actin transition during L. penumophila infection. Furthermore, the intracellular proliferation of wipA/legK2 double mutant was significantly impaired at the late stage of infection, although the absence of WipA does not confer any further effect on actin polymerisation to the legK2 mutant. Collectively, this study provides unique insights into the WipA-mediated regulation of host actin polymerisation and assists us to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of L. pnuemophila infection.","['He L', 'Lin Y', 'Ge ZH', 'He SY', 'Zhao BB', 'Shen D', 'He JG', 'Lu YJ']",2019,21,6,Cell Microbiol,"He L, et al.

C. elegans nematodes have several appealing attributes as a host organism; they are inexpensive, have robust genetic analysis tools, have a simple anatomy yet display a wide range of complex behaviors, and, as invertebrates, do not require animal ethics protocols. Use of C. elegans as a host model complements cell-based models, providing additional support and consistency of the experimental data obtained from multiple models. The C. elegans innate immune system functions similarly to that of the alveolar macrophage including the apoptosis [a.k.a. programmed cell death (PCD)] pathway located within the germline. The digestive tract of C. elegans is a primary interface between the innate immune system and bacterial pathogens. Thus, the C. elegans host model provides an alternative approach to investigate L. pneumophila immunopathogenesis, particularly in the view of the recent discovery of Legionella-containing vacuoles within the gonadal tissues of Legionella-colonized nematodes supporting the plausible evolutionary origin of the strategies employed by L. pneumophila to counteract macrophage cellular responses.","['Brassinga AKC', 'Sifri CD']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,Brassinga AKC and Sifri CD.

Since then additional microbial pathogens that can be studied in D. discoideum have been reported. The organism has various advantages for the dissection of the complex cross-talk between a host and a pathogen. A fully sequenced and well-curated genome is available, there are excellent molecular genetic tools on the market, and the generation of targeted multiple gene knock-outs as well as the realization of untargeted genetic screens is generally straightforward. Dictyostelium also offers easy cultivation, and the cells are suitable for cell biological studies, which in combination with in vivo expression of fluorescence-tagged proteins allows the investigation of the dynamics of bacterial uptake and infection. Furthermore, a large mutant collection is available at the Dictyostelium stock center, favoring the identification of host resistance or susceptibility genes.

30694503,The Galleria mellonella Infection Model for Investigating the Molecular Mechanisms of Legionella Virulence.,"Legionella species evolved virulence factors to exploit protozoa as replicative niches in the environment. Cell culture infection models demonstrated that many of these factors also enable the bacteria to thrive in human macrophages; however, these models do not recapitulate the complex interactions between macrophages, lung epithelial, and additional immune cells, which are crucial to control bacterial infections. Thus, suitable infection models are required to understand which bacterial factors are important to trigger disease. Guinea pigs and, most frequently, mice have been successfully used as mammalian model hosts; however, ethical and economic considerations impede their use in high-throughput screening studies of Legionella isolates or small molecule inhibitors.Here, we describe the larvae of the lepidopteran Galleria mellonella as insect model of Legionella pathogenesis. Larvae can be obtained from commercial suppliers in large numbers, maintained without the need of specialized equipment, and infected by injection. Although lacking the complexity of a mammalian immune system, the larvae mount humoral and cellular immune responses to infection. L. pneumophila strain 130b and other prototype isolates withstand these responses and use the Defective in organelle trafficking/Intracellular multiplication (Dot/Icm) type IV secretion system (T4SS ) to inject effectors enabling survival and replication in hemocytes, insect phagocytes, ultimately leading to the death of the larvae. Differences in virulence between L. pneumophila isolates or gene deletion mutants can be analyzed using indicators of larval health and immune induction, such as pigmentation, mobility, histopathology, and survival. Bacterial replication can be measured by plating hemolymph or by immunofluorescence microscopy of isolated circulating hemocytes from infected larvae. Combined, these straightforward experimental readouts make G. mellonella larvae a versatile model host to rapidly assess the virulence of different Legionella isolates and investigate the role of specific virulence factors in overcoming innate host defense mechanisms.","['Frankel G', 'Schroeder GN']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,Frankel G and Schroeder GN.

30694502,Infection of Human Lung Tissue Explants (HLTEs) with Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionnaires' disease is a severe pneumonia caused by inhalation of Legionella pneumophila. Although powerful infection models ranging from monocellular host systems to mammals were developed, numerous intra- and extracellular interactions of L. pneumophila factors with human lung tissue structures remain unknown. Therefore, we developed and applied a novel infection model for Legionnaires' disease comprising living human lung tissue explants (HLTEs). This model allows analyzing Legionella infections at a unique level of complexity and narrows the gap between current infection models and postmortem histopathology analyses of infected patients. Here we describe the infection of tumor-free pulmonary tissue samples from patients undergoing lobe- or pneumectomy because of lung cancer. The method comprises bacterial cultivation, preparation of HLTEs, and infection of HLTEs. The infected tissue samples allow to characterize tissue damage, bacterial localization, dissemination and growth kinetics, and the host's molecular response.","['Scheithauer L', 'Steinert M']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,Scheithauer L and Steinert M.

30694501,Inflammasome Activation in Legionella-Infected Macrophages.,"Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that infects many species of unicellular protozoa in freshwater environments. The human infection is accidental, and the bacteria may not have evolved strategies to bypass innate immune signaling in mammalian macrophages. Thus, L. pneumophila triggers many innate immune pathways including inflammasome activation. The inflammasomes are multimolecular platforms assembled in the host cell cytoplasm and lead to activation of inflammatory caspases. Inflammasome activation leads to secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, and an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis, which initiates with the induction of a pore in the macrophage membranes. In this chapter we provide detailed protocols to evaluate Legionella-induced inflammasome activation in macrophages, including real-time pore formation assay, western blotting to detect activation of inflammatory caspases (cleavage and pulldown), and the measurement of inflammatory cytokines.","['Mascarenhas DPA', 'Zamboni DS']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,Mascarenhas DPA and Zamboni DS.

30694499,Purification and Analysis of Effector Glucosyltransferase Lgt1 from Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for legionellosis, a severe lung disease in humans. This bacterium uses a type 4b secretion system to deliver various effector proteins into the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic target cell. Among those is the glucosyltransferase Lgt1. This effector modifies serine-53 in eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) by mono-O-glucosylation. Modification of eEF1A results in inhibition of protein synthesis and death of the eukaryotic cell, processes which are thought to contribute to Legionella infection. Here we describe a protocol for isolation of the glucosyltransferase Lgt1 from L. pneumophila culture followed by assaying its enzymatic activity using ","['Levanova N', 'Tabakova I', 'Jank T', 'Belyi Y']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,"Levanova N, et al.

30694498,Methods for Noncanonical Ubiquitination and Deubiquitination Catalyzed by Legionella pneumophila Effector Proteins.,"Protein ubiquitination is one of the most prevalent posttranslational modifications; it regulates a wide range of critical cellular processes in eukaryotes. This modification occurs by covalent attachment of the ubiquitin molecule to other proteins via an isopeptide bond in reactions typically catalyzed by sequential actions of three enzymes, including ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). Ubiquitination is a reversible process catalyzed by a group of proteins known as deubiquitinase (DUB), which specifically cleaves the isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and modified proteins. Recently, a novel form of ubiquitination catalyzed by the SidE family of effectors from the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila was reported. These proteins ubiquitinate structurally diverse host proteins such as reticulons and ER-associated Rab small GTPases by a two-step mechanism that uses NAD as the energy source for ubiquitin activation prior to being transferred to serine residues in target proteins. This process bypasses the need for E1 and E2 enzymes. Intriguingly, ubiquitination induced by SidEs is regulated by SidJ, another L. pneumophila effector protein which reverses the modification by functioning as an unconventional DUB. Here, we summarize the experimental details of Rab small GTPases (use Rab33b as an example) ubiquitination catalyzed by SidEs (use SdeA as an example) as well as deubiquitination catalyzed by SidJ.","['Qiu J', 'Luo ZQ']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,Qiu J and Luo ZQ.

30694497,In Situ Imaging and Structure Determination of Bacterial Toxin Delivery Systems Using Electron Cryotomography.,"Determining the three-dimensional structure of biomacromolecules at high resolution in their native cellular environment is a major challenge for structural biology. Toward this end, electron cryotomography (ECT) allows large bio-macromolecular assemblies to be imaged directly in their hydrated physiological milieu to ~4 nm resolution. Combining ECT with other techniques like fluorescent imaging, immunogold labeling, and genetic manipulation has allowed the in situ investigation of complex biological processes at macromolecular resolution. Furthermore, the advent of cryogenic focused ion beam (FIB) milling has extended the domain of ECT to include regions even deep within thick eukaryotic cells. Anticipating two audiences (scientists who just want to understand the potential and general workflow involved and scientists who are learning how to do the work themselves), here we present both a broad overview of this kind of work and a step-by-step example protocol for ECT and subtomogram averaging using the Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) as a case study. While the general workflow is presented in step-by-step detail, we refer to online tutorials, user's manuals, and other training materials for the essential background understanding needed to perform each step.","['Ghosal D', 'Kaplan M', 'Chang YW', 'Jensen GJ']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,"Ghosal D, et al.

30694495,Perturbation of Legionella Cell Infection by RNA Interference.,"Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular bacterium, which grows in amoebae as well as in macrophages and epithelial cells. Depletion of genes of interest by RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be a robust and economic technique to study L. pneumophila-host cell interactions. Predesigned and often validated double-stranded (ds) RNA oligonucleotides that silence specific genes are commercially available. RNAi results in a reduced level of distinct proteins, which allows studying the specific role of host cell components involved in L. pneumophila infection. Here, we describe how to assess RNAi-mediated protein depletion efficiency and cytotoxic effects in human A549 lung epithelial cells and murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrate how RNAi can be used to screen for novel host cell proteins involved in the formation of the Legionella-containing vacuole and intracellular replication of the pathogen.","['Steiner B', 'Swart AL', 'Hilbi H']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,"Steiner B, et al.

30694493,Single Cell Analysis of Legionella and Legionella-Infected Acanthamoeba by Agarose Embedment.,"Legionella pneumophila resides in multispecies biofilms, where it infects and replicates in environmental protozoa such as Acanthamoeba castellanii. Studies on L. pneumophila physiology and host-pathogen interactions are frequently conducted using clonal bacterial populations and population level analysis, overlooking the remarkable differences in single cell behavior. The fastidious nutrient requirements of extracellular L. pneumophila and the extraordinary motility of Acanthamoeba castellanii hamper an analysis at single cell resolution. In this chapter, we describe a method to study L. pneumophila and its natural host A. castellanii at single cell level by using an agarose embedment assay. Agarose-embedded bacteria and infected cells can be monitored over several hours up to several days. Using properly adapted flow chambers, agarose-embedded specimens can be subjected to a wide range of fluctuating conditions.","['Personnic N', 'Striednig B', 'Hilbi H']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,"Personnic N, et al.

30694492,Sorting of Phagocytic Cells Infected with Legionella pneumophila.,"The ability of Legionella pneumophila to colonize host cells and to form a replicative vacuole depends on its ability to counteract the host cell response by secreting more than 300 effectors. The host cell responds to this bacterial invasion with extensive intracellular signaling to counteract the replication of the pathogen. When studying L. pneumophila infection in vitro, only a small proportion of the cell lines or primary cells used to analyze the host response are infected; the study of such a mixed cell population leads to unprecise results. In order to study the multitude of pathogen-induced phenotypic changes occurring in the host cell, the separation of infected from uninfected cells is a top priority. Here we describe a highly efficient FACS-derived protocol to separate cells infected with a L. pneumophila strain encoding a fluorescent protein. Indeed, the highly infected, homogenous cell population obtained after sorting is the best possible starting point for the studies of infection-induced effects.","['Rolando M', 'Buchrieser C']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,Rolando M and Buchrieser C.

30694491,Quantitative Imaging Flow Cytometry of Legionella-Containing Vacuoles in Dually Fluorescence-Labeled Dictyostelium.,"Legionella pneumophila enters and replicates within protozoan and mammalian phagocytes by forming through a conserved mechanism a specialized intracellular compartment termed the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). This compartment avoids fusion with bactericidal lysosomes but communicates extensively with different cellular vesicle trafficking pathways and ultimately interacts closely with the endoplasmic reticulum. In order to delineate the process of pathogen vacuole formation and to better understand L. pneumophila virulence, an analysis of markers of the different trafficking pathways on the pathogen vacuole is crucial. Here, we describe a method for rapid, objective and quantitative analysis of different fluorescently tagged proteins or probes on the LCV. To this end, we employ an imaging flow cytometry approach and use the D. discoideum -L. pneumophila infection model. Imaging flow cytometry enables quantification of many different parameters by fluorescence microscopy of cells in flow, rapidly producing statistically robust data from thousands of cells. We also describe the generation of D. discoideum strains simultaneously producing two different fluorescently tagged probes that enable visualization of compartments and processes in parallel. The quantitative imaging flow technique can be corroborated and enhanced by laser scanning confocal microscopy.","['Welin A', 'Weber S', 'Hilbi H']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,"Welin A, et al.

30694490,Genetic Manipulation of Non-pneumophila Legionella: Protocols Developed for Legionella longbeachae.,"Current biomedical research into Legionnaires' disease is dominated by studies of Legionella pneumophila, largely because this pathogen is responsible for approximately 90% of clinical disease worldwide. However, in certain geographical regions, infections with non-pneumophila species are responsible for a significant proportion of diagnosed Legionnaires' disease. Understanding the pathogenesis of these non-pneumophila species of Legionella is an important step toward clinical intervention. The capacity to genetically manipulate these pathogens is essential in order to understand the genetic factors that contribute to infection and the environmental life cycle of these bacteria. The capacity to delete, mutate, and relocate genetic regions of interest allows molecular research into gene function and importance. In this chapter, methods are outlined to introduce plasmids into Legionella by electroporation. This technique is particularly useful as it is often the essential preliminary step to experiments that observe the behavior of the bacterium under altered conditions, for example, the transformation of bacteria with reporter plasmids to monitor Dot/Icm effector translocation. Electroporation is a well-established method for transformation of competent bacteria, and here specific protocols are provided, suiting a range of materials and conditions that have been successfully applied to L. longbeachae and L. dumoffii. Additionally, a homologous recombination approach to delete genetic regions of interest in L. longbeachae is outlined. The application of these techniques allows for identification of the genetic determinants of non-pneumophila Legionella virulence and for important comparative studies with other Legionella species.","['Korevaar E', 'Khoo CA', 'Newton HJ']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,"Korevaar E, et al.

30694489,Screening Targeted Legionella pneumophila Mutant Libraries In Vivo Using INSeq.,"Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that can cause a severe inflammatory pneumonia in humans called Legionnaires' disease, which results from bacterial replication within alveolar macrophages. L. pneumophila replication within macrophages is dependent on hundreds of individual protein virulence factors. Understanding how these virulence factors contribute to disease in an animal model is important to reveal aspects of host-pathogen interactions. High-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based screens using transposon (Tn) mutagenesis are powerful approaches to identify bacterial genes important for host-pathogen interactions. Since large libraries of Tn mutants are at risk of bottleneck effects, phenotypic screening of smaller numbers of targeted mutants is an effective alternative. Insertion sequencing (INSeq) is a method that enables production of targeted Tn mutant libraries and has been used successfully to identify L. pneumophila virulence phenotypes. In this chapter, a protocol is described for using INSeq to generate an arrayed L. pneumophila Tn mutant library and for subsequent screening of targeted mutant pools in a mouse model of infection.",['Shames SR'],2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,Shames SR.

30694488,Querying Legionella Genomes Using Transposition-Sequencing.,"Transposition-sequencing (Tn-seq) has recently emerged as a powerful technique to query bacterial genomes. Tn-seq can be used to query the bacterial genome with unprecedented resolution, allowing the identification of small genes (e.g., noncoding RNA) that may be missed in conventional screening approaches. Tn-seq can be used to predict genes essential for in vitro growth and to directly identify genetic requirements for survival under multiple conditions. For instance, Tn-seq can be applied to determine the genes, and cellular processes, required to resist an antibacterial treatment or to acquire new resistance genes, to adapt to intracellular life or to compete with other bacteria. Virtually any assay that involves a selection pressure can be used to identify the associated genetic determinants. So far, genome-wide Tn-seq has not been applied to Legionella species. Here, we provide a protocol covering all the different steps to conduct a Tn-seq analysis in L. pneumophila. This includes generating a high-density library of insertional mutants, setting up a selection screen, sequencing the libraries, mapping the insertion sites, and analyzing the data to obtain the list of genes involved in surviving the applied selection.","['Hardy L', 'Charpentier X']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,Hardy L and Charpentier X.

Here, we described a two-step protocol relevant in Legionella pneumophila. This efficient two-step protocol uses the natural transformability of L. pneumophila and linear DNA fragments as substrates for recombination without the necessity of intermediate hosts to amplify targeted DNA. Based on a suicide cassette strategy, this genetic toolbox enables to generate clean scar-free deletions, single-nucleotide mutation, transcriptional or translational fusions, as well as insertion at any chosen place in L. pneumophila chromosome, therefore enabling multiple mutations with no need of multiple selection markers.","['Bailo N', 'Kanaan H', 'Kay E', 'Charpentier X', 'Doublet P', 'Gilbert C']",2019,1921,,Methods Mol Biol,"Bailo N, et al.

30682021,Using an optimal set of features with a machine learning-based approach to predict effector proteins for Legionella pneumophila.,"Type IV secretion systems exist in a number of bacterial pathogens and are used to secrete effector proteins directly into host cells in order to change their environment making the environment hospitable for the bacteria. In recent years, several machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict effector proteins, potentially facilitating experimental verification. However, inconsistencies exist between their results. Previously we analysed the disparate sets of predictive features used in these algorithms to determine an optimal set of 370 features for effector prediction. This study focuses on the best way to use these optimal features by designing three machine learning classifiers, comparing our results with those of others, and obtaining de novo results. We chose the pathogen Legionella pneumophila strain Philadelphia-1, a cause of Legionnaires' disease, because it has many validated effector proteins and others have developed machine learning prediction tools for it. While all of our models give good results indicating that our optimal features are quite robust, Model 1, which uses all 370 features with a support vector machine, has slightly better accuracy. Moreover, Model 1 predicted 472 effector proteins that are deemed highly probable to be effectors and include 94% of known effectors. Although the results of our three models agree well with those of other researchers, their models only predicted 126 and 311 candidate effectors.","['Esna Ashari Z', 'Brayton KA', 'Broschat SL']",2019,14,1,PLoS One,"Esna Ashari Z, et al.

30679570,Legionella SBT applied directly to respiratory samples as a rapid molecular epidemiological tool.,"Legionnaires' disease (LD) is an atypical pneumonia caused by the inhalation of Legionella. The methods used for the diagnosis of LD are direct culture of respiratory samples and urinary antigen detection. However, the sensitivity of culture is low, and the urinary antigen test is specific only for L. pneumophila sg1. Moreover, as no isolates are obtained, epidemiological studies cannot be performed. The implementation of Nested-sequence-based typing (Nested-SBT) makes it possible to carry out epidemiological studies while also confirming LD, especially in cases caused by non-sg 1. Sixty-two respiratory samples from patients with Legionella clinically confirmed by positive urinary antigen tests were cultured and tested by Nested-SBT, following the European Study Group for Legionella Infections (ESGLI) protocol. Only 2/62 (3.2%) respiratory samples were culture-positive. Amplification and sequencing of Nested-SBT genes were successfully performed in 57/62 samples (91.9%). The seven target genes were characterised in 39/57 (68.4%) respiratory samples, and the complete sequence type (ST) was obtained. The mip gene was the most frequently amplified and sequenced. Nested-SBT is a useful method for epidemiological studies in culture-negative samples, achieving a 28.7-fold improvement over the results of culture studies and reducing the time needed to obtain molecular epidemiological results.","['Quero S', 'Párraga-Niño N', 'Sabria M', 'Barrabeig I', 'Sala MR', 'Jané M', 'Mateu L', 'Sopena N', 'Pedro-Botet ML', 'Garcia-Nuñez M']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Quero S, et al.

To date, only 11 cases of Legionnaire's Disease in pregnancy have been reported, though this small number could possibly be attributed to underdiagnoses and under documentation. Case Presentation: In this paper, we present a 31-year-old Hispanic female, gravida 4, para 1 from the southwest United States who presented with a 3-week history of fever, worsening cough, dyspnea on exertion, and hypoxemia. Chest x-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates, with positive serology for Legionella IgM and IgG (1:250 and 1:640 respectively), as well as positive urinary antigen. Despite appropriate treatment with azithromycin 500 mg, she continued to have dyspnea and mild respiratory distress. Conclusion: Upon follow up, mother and fetus initially remained stable without any signs of sequelae from Legionnaire's disease, but the patient miscarried 5 weeks after the second admission to the hospital.

GpsB is a cytosolic protein that affects cell wall synthesis by binding cytoplasmic mini-domains of peptidoglycan synthases to ensure their correct subcellular localisation. Here, we describe critical structural features for the interaction of GpsB with peptidoglycan synthases from three bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and suggest their importance for cell wall growth and viability in L. monocytogenes and S. pneumoniae. We use these structural motifs to identify novel partners of GpsB in B. subtilis and extend the members of the GpsB interactome in all three bacterial species. Our results support that GpsB functions as an adaptor protein that mediates the interaction between membrane proteins, scaffolding proteins, signalling proteins and enzymes to generate larger protein complexes at specific sites in a bacterial cell cycle-dependent manner.","['Cleverley RM', 'Rutter ZJ', 'Rismondo J', 'Corona F', 'Tsui HT', 'Alatawi FA', 'Daniel RA', 'Halbedel S', 'Massidda O', 'Winkler ME', 'Lewis RJ']",2019,10,1,Nat Commun,"Cleverley RM, et al.

30648305,Aurantimycin resistance genes contribute to survival of Listeria monocytogenes during life in the environment.,"Bacteria can cope with toxic compounds such as antibiotics by inducing genes for their detoxification. A common detoxification strategy is compound excretion by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which are synthesized upon compound contact. We previously identified the multidrug resistance ABC transporter LieAB in Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive bacterium that occurs ubiquitously in the environment, but also causes severe infections in humans upon ingestion. Expression of the lieAB genes is strongly induced in cells lacking the PadR-type transcriptional repressor LftR, but compounds leading to relief of this repression in wild-type cells were not known. Using RNA-Seq and promoter-lacZ fusions, we demonstrate highly specific repression of the lieAB and lftRS promoters through LftR. Screening of a natural compound library yielded the depsipeptide aurantimycin A - synthesized by the soil-dwelling Streptomyces aurantiacus - as the first known naturally occurring inducer of lieAB expression. Genetic and phenotypic experiments concordantly show that aurantimycin A is a substrate of the LieAB transporter and thus, lftRS and lieAB represent the first known genetic module conferring and regulating aurantimycin A resistance. Collectively, these genes may support the survival of L. monocytogenes when it comes into contact with antibiotic-producing bacteria in the soil.","['Hauf S', 'Herrmann J', 'Miethke M', 'Gibhardt J', 'Commichau FM', 'Müller R', 'Fuchs S', 'Halbedel S']",2019,111,4,Mol Microbiol,"Hauf S, et al.

30646071,Legionnaires Disease Surveillance in US Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Facilities and Assessment of Health Care Facility Association.,"IMPORTANCE: Legionnaires disease (LD) incidence is increasing in the United States. Health care facilities are a high-risk setting for transmission of Legionella bacteria from building water systems to occupants. However, the contribution of LD in health care facilities to national LD rates is not well characterized.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the burden of LD in US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients and to assess the amount of LD with VA exposure.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of reported LD data in VA medical facilities in a national VA LD surveillance system from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016. The study population included total veteran enrollees and enrollees who used the VA health care system.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was assessment of annual LD rates, categorized by VA and non-VA exposure. Legionnaires disease rates for cases with VA exposure were determined on both population and exposure potential levels. Rates by VA exposure potential were calculated using inpatient bed days of care, long-term care resident days, or outpatient encounters. In addition, types and amounts of LD diagnostic testing were calculated. Case and testing data were analyzed nationally and regionally.
RESULTS: There were 491 LD cases in the case report surveillance system from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016. Most cases (447 [91%]) had no VA exposure or only outpatient VA exposure. The remaining 44 cases had VA exposure from overnight stays. Total LD rates from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, increased for all VA enrollees (from 1.5 to 2.0 per 100 000 enrollees; P = .04) and for users of VA health care (2.3 to 3.0 per 100 000 enrollees; P = .04). The LD rate for the subset who had no VA exposure also increased (0.90 to 1.47 per 100 000 enrollees; P < .001). In contrast, the LD rate for patients with VA overnight stay decreased on a population level (5.0 to 2.3 per 100 000 enrollees; P < .001) and an exposure level (0.31 to 0.15 per 100 000 enrollees; P < .001). Regionally, the eastern United States had the highest LD rates. The urine antigen test was the most used LD diagnostic method; 49 805 tests were performed in 2015-2016 with 335 positive results (0.67%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Data in the VA LD databases showed an increase in overall LD rates over the 3 years, driven by increases in rates of non-VA LD. Inpatient VA-associated LD rates decreased, suggesting that the VA's LD prevention efforts have contributed to improved patient safety.","['Gamage SD', 'Ambrose M', 'Kralovic SM', 'Simbartl LA', 'Roselle GA']",2018,1,2,JAMA Netw Open,"Gamage SD, et al.

30638676,Overview and comparison of Legionella regulations worldwide.,"BACKGROUND: Legionnaires disease occurs worldwide. Many authorities have guidelines and regulations to prevent and control Legionella in water systems. These regulations are based on often very limited field and laboratory observations and measurements. They are, therefore, very different from country to country. This article aims to map the existing regulatory framework of worldwide Legionella control to assess the feasibility of regulatory unification.
METHODS: This article gives an overview of the different standards, guidelines, and recommendations as well as how various authorities and/or countries deal with Legionella infection. A 3-step process is followed to identify current regulations.
RESULTS: Although Legionella is a global concern with a common scientific base, the regulatory framework is different from country to country. The current guidelines and standards are not the best possible. Despite different regulatory frameworks, there is still broad unification of underlying principles. Common principles across regulations are avoiding and monitoring critical spots, avoiding water stagnation, and maintaining sufficiently high temperature (above 60°C, below 25°C). Differences between regulations are target group and dangerous Legionella concentration levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparative analysis of the framework is a good starting point for reaching future regulatory unification based on common ground.","['Van Kenhove E', 'Dinne K', 'Janssens A', 'Laverge J']",2019,47,8,Am J Infect Control,"Van Kenhove E, et al.

Despite potentially widespread exposure, human disease is relatively uncommon, except under circumstances where pathogen concentrations are high, host immunity is low, or exposure to small-diameter aerosols occurs. Water quality guidance values for Legionella are available for building managers but are generally not based on technical criteria. To address this gap, a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was conducted using target risk values in order to calculate corresponding critical concentrations on a per-fixture and aggregate (multiple fixture exposure) basis. Showers were the driving indoor exposure risk compared to sinks and toilets. Critical concentrations depended on the dose response model (infection vs clinical severity infection, CSI), risk target used (infection risk vs disability adjusted life years [DALY] on a per-exposure or annual basis), and fixture type (conventional vs water efficient or ""green""). Median critical concentrations based on exposure to a combination of toilet, faucet, and shower aerosols ranged from ∼10","['Hamilton KA', 'Hamilton MT', 'Johnson W', 'Jjemba P', 'Bukhari Z', 'LeChevallier M', 'Haas CN', 'Gurian PL']",2019,53,8,Environ Sci Technol,"Hamilton KA, et al.

30623561,The pleiotropic Legionella transcription factor LvbR links the Lqs and c-di-GMP regulatory networks to control biofilm architecture and virulence.,"The causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, Legionella pneumophila, colonizes amoebae and biofilms in the environment. The opportunistic pathogen employs the Lqs (Legionella quorum sensing) system and the signalling molecule LAI-1 (Legionella autoinducer-1) to regulate virulence, motility, natural competence and expression of a 133 kb genomic ""fitness island"", including a putative novel regulator. Here, we show that the regulator termed LvbR is an LqsS-regulated transcription factor that binds to the promoter of lpg1056/hnox1 (encoding an inhibitor of the diguanylate cyclase Lpg1057), and thus, regulates proteins involved in c-di-GMP metabolism. LvbR determines biofilm architecture, since L. pneumophila lacking lvbR accumulates less sessile biomass and forms homogeneous mat-like structures, while the parental strain develops more compact bacterial aggregates. Comparative transcriptomics of sessile and planktonic ΔlvbR or ΔlqsR mutant strains revealed concerted (virulence, fitness island, metabolism) and reciprocally (motility) regulated genes in biofilm and broth respectively. Moreover, ΔlvbR is hyper-competent for DNA uptake, defective for phagocyte infection, outcompeted by the parental strain in amoebae co-infections and impaired for cell migration inhibition. Taken together, our results indicate that L. pneumophila LvbR is a novel pleiotropic transcription factor, which links the Lqs and c-di-GMP regulatory networks to control biofilm architecture and pathogen-host cell interactions.","['Hochstrasser R', 'Kessler A', 'Sahr T', 'Simon S', 'Schell U', 'Gomez-Valero L', 'Buchrieser C', 'Hilbi H']",2019,21,3,Environ Microbiol,"Hochstrasser R, et al.

Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila remain the major etiological agents and are responsible for a significant proportion of CAP mortality. Among diagnostic tests for CAP, urine antigen detection of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila is widely accepted due to the simplicity of collection and the rapidity of the test results. Areas covered: This comprehensive review outlines the urinary antigen tests available, discusses their sensitivity and specificity, and assesses the usefulness of their results as the basis for targeted therapy. Expert commentary: There have been advances in urine antigen detection tests for patients with CAP. New methodologies show greater sensitivity, detect S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in a single test, and also detect pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, urine antigen detection tests have shown a high specificity, which means that a positive result practically indicates the causative pathogen of CAP. Therefore, a positive result can lead to a targeted therapy that is likely to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of resistance and adverse events.

30594092,Impact of blending for direct potable reuse on premise plumbing microbial ecology and regrowth of opportunistic pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria.,"Little is known about how introducing recycled water intended for direct potable reuse (DPR) into distribution systems and premise plumbing will affect water quality at the point of use, particularly with respect to effects on microbial communities and regrowth. The examination of potential growth of opportunistic pathogens (OPs) and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), each representing serious and growing public health concerns, by introducing DPR water has not previously been evaluated. In this study, the impact of blending purified DPR water with traditional drinking water sources was investigated with respect to treatment techniques, blending location, and blending ratio. Water from four U.S. utility partners was treated in bench- and pilot-scale treatment trains to simulate DPR with blending. Water was incubated in simulated premise plumbing rigs made of PVC pipe containing brass coupons to measure regrowth of total bacteria (16S rRNA genes, heterotrophic plate count), OPs (Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ARGs (qnrA, vanA), and an indicator of horizontal gene transfer and multi-drug resistance (intI1). The microbial community composition was profiled and the resistome (i.e., all ARGs present) was characterized in select samples using next generation sequencing. While regrowth of total bacteria (16S rRNA genes) from the start of the incubation through week eight consistently occurred across tested scenarios (Wilcoxon, p ≤ 0.0001), total bacteria were not more abundant in the water or biofilm of any DPR scenario than in the corresponding conventional potable condition (p ≥ 0.0748). Regrowth of OP marker genes, qnrA, vanA, and intI1 were not significantly greater in water or biofilm for any DPR blends treated with advanced oxidation compared to corresponding potable water (p ≥ 0.1047).

30594053,Occurrence of Legionella in groundwater used for sprinkler irrigation in Southern Italy.,"Legionellae are opportunistic bacteria that cause various conditions after exposure to contaminated aerosols, ranging from a serious type of pneumonia to a mild case of an influenza-like illness. Despite the risks of exposure, little is known about the occurrence of Legionella in natural environments and, even though studies have shown that there is a potential risk of transmission via inhalation, it does not have to be detected in groundwater that is used for irrigation. The culture methods traditionally used to detect Legionella have several limits that can be partly solved by applying molecular techniques. Samples from 177 wells in Apulia, Southern Italy, were collected twice, in winter and in summer, and analyzed. When compared with the guidelines, 145 (81.9%) of the sampled wells were suitable for irrigation use. The culture-based method highlighted the presence of different species and serogroups of Legionella in 31 (21.2%) of the 145 wells that were shown to be suitable for irrigation use. A greater number of wells returned positive results for Legionella in summer than in winter (p = 0.023), and the median concentrations were mostly higher in summer (500 CFU/L) than in winter (300 CFU/L). The median temperature in the Legionella positive well waters was significantly higher than that in the negative ones, both in winter and in summer (p < 0.001). Using molecular techniques, Legionella non-pneumophila was found in 37 of the 114 wells earlier detected as suitable for irrigation use but negative for Legionella by the culture-based methods. The distribution of Legionella differ significantly in porous aquifers compared to the karst-fissured ones both with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (p = 0.0004) and viable cells by propidium monoazide (PMA-qPCR) (p = 0.0000). Legionella concentrations were weakly correlated with temperature of water both with qPCR (ρ = 0.47, p = 0.0033) and PMA-qPCR (ρ = 0.41, p = 0.0126). Our data suggest that water that aerosolizes when sprinkled on plants represents a potential source of Legionellosis, with a higher risk from exposure in summer. On a practical level, this finding is important for workers (farmers and gardeners) who are in contact with waters used for irrigation.","['De Giglio O', 'Napoli C', 'Apollonio F', 'Brigida S', 'Marzella A', 'Diella G', 'Calia C', 'Scrascia M', 'Pacifico C', 'Pazzani C', 'Uricchio VF', 'Montagna MT']",2019,170,,Environ Res,"De Giglio O, et al.

30591389,Epidemiological surveillance and wild-type MIC distribution of Legionella pneumophila in north-western Spain. 2003-2016.,"PURPOSE: To perform epidemiological surveillance of Legionella pneumophila in recreational swimming pools in the city of Valladolid (Spain), an area with a continental climate and low incidence of legionella-associated infections. Additionally, wild-type minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions for eight antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of legionellosis were calculated from the isolates obtained.
METHODS: Twelve recreational pools were enrolled between June 2003 and December 2016 and 7221 water samples were taken from three different points of the water network (tank, tap and shower). Legionella culture was performed according to ISO 11731 and 11731-2 standards. MICs of antibiotics were obtained by a gradient test.
RESULTS: 1.44% of the water samples were positive for L. pneumophila. 60 strains (57.69%) were isolated from showers, 26 (25.00%) from tanks and 18 (17.31%) from taps. L. pneumophila counts were <100CFU/L in 75 samples (72.12%), 100-1000CFU/L in 17 (16.35%) and >1000CFU/L in 12 (11.54%). The MIC
CONCLUSIONS: The use of showers in recreational pools can become a potential pathway for exposure to L. pneumophila, even in cold climates. The wild-type MIC distributions presented in this article may be useful for a better detection of antibiotic resistance and can contribute to improvements in the choice of the antibiotic treatment of legionellosis.","['March GA', 'Gutiérrez MP', 'López I', 'Muñoz MF', 'Ortiz de Lejarazu R', 'Simarro M', 'Orduña A', 'Bratos MÁ']",2019,37,8,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin (Engl Ed),"March GA, et al.

30587144,New approach to environmental investigation of an explosive legionnaires´ disease outbreak in Spain: early identification of potential risk sources by rapid Legionella spp immunosensing technique.,"BACKGROUND: An explosive outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (LD) was identified on 11 December 2015 in Manzanares, Ciudad Real, Spain, and was declared closed by 03 February 2016. The number of declared cases was 593 with 277 confirmed cases so that it can be considered as one of the outbreaks with highest attack rate. This rate could be attributed to the ageing of the population, among others, in addition to various risk factors and habits, and the meteorological conditions (thermal inversion) maintained in this municipality at the time. The Public Health Services succeeded in breaking the bacterial transmission. Several facilities were early identified by microbiological analysis, including a cooling tower and a decorative fountain, as possible infectious sources. Rapid analytical techniques for rapid Legionella detection and the shutdown and preventative closure of positive installations have been considered key elements in the control of this outbreak.
RESULTS: Rapid microbiological analysis helped to the early identification of potential risk sources in a Legionnaires´ disease outbreak, reducing decision-making processes according to the actual needs of the intervention in public health and shortening the exposure of the population.
CONCLUSIONS: Protocolized and immediate intervention in an outbreak is a crucial issue to reduce their effects on public health. For this, identification and control of the suspicious sources able to disseminate the bacteria and cause the illness is required. Rapid analytical techniques like immunomagnetic separation (IMS) method based on the whole bacterial cell detection are shown as excellent tools to investigate all the potential sources of risk.","['Cebrián F', 'Montero JC', 'Fernández PJ']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Cebrián F, et al.

30563504,Atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia: a worldwide perspective.,"BACKGROUND: Empirical antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has long been debated, mainly because of a lack of epidemiological data. We aimed to assess both testing for atypical pathogens and their prevalence in hospitalized patients with CAP worldwide, especially in relation with disease severity.
METHODS: A secondary analysis of the GLIMP database, an international, multicentre, point-prevalence study of adult patients admitted for CAP in 222 hospitals across 6 continents in 2015, was performed. The study evaluated frequency of testing for atypical pathogens, including L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and their prevalence. Risk factors for testing and prevalence for atypical pathogens were assessed through univariate analysis.
RESULTS: Among 3702 CAP patients 1250 (33.8%) underwent at least one test for atypical pathogens. Testing varies greatly among countries and its frequency was higher in Europe than elsewhere (46.0% vs. 12.7%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Detection of L. pneumophila urinary antigen was the most common test performed worldwide (32.0%). Patients with severe CAP were less likely to be tested for both atypical pathogens considered together (30.5% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.009) and specifically for legionellosis (28.3% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.003) than the rest of the population. Similarly, L. pneumophila testing was lower in ICU patients. At least one atypical pathogen was isolated in 62 patients (4.7%), including M. pneumoniae (26/251 patients, 10.3%), L. pneumophila (30/1186 patients, 2.5%), and C. pneumoniae (8/228 patients, 3.5%). Patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens were significantly younger, showed less cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic comorbidities in comparison to adult patients hospitalized due to non-atypical pathogen CAP.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing for atypical pathogens in patients admitted for CAP in poorly standardized in real life and does not mirror atypical prevalence in different settings. Further evidence on the impact of atypical pathogens, expecially in the low-income countries, is needed to guidelines implementation.","['Gramegna A', 'Sotgiu G', 'Di Pasquale M', 'Radovanovic D', 'Terraneo S', 'Reyes LF', 'Vendrell E', 'Neves J', 'Menzella F', 'Blasi F', 'Aliberti S', 'Restrepo MI', 'GLIMP Study Group']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Gramegna A, et al.

METHODS: Legionnaires&rsquo; disease cases were defined according to Swiss and European (ELDSNet) consensus guidelines. An outbreak investigation task force was put in place. Patients were interviewed, when feasible, with a standard questionnaire. A Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen test was performed in all cases. Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens were collected for culture, polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) assay, monoclonal antibody subtyping and sequenced-based typing (SBT). Multiple environmental samples were collected. Case geographical mapping was performed and local meteorological data were obtained.
RESULTS: Thirty-four confirmed cases of Legionnaires&rsquo; disease were identified between 20 June 2017 and 16 September 2017, including 28 patients living in the Canton of Geneva and 6 cases in neighbouring cantons and France. The case fatality rate was 8.8%. The urinary antigen test was positive in 32/34 (94.1%) cases. Among the 17/34 (50%) cases with available LRT specimens, 8 (47.1%) were culture/PCR positive, 5 (29.4%) were PCR positive only, and 4 (23.5%) were culture/PCR negative. Monoclonal antibody subtyping and SBT on 12 samples allowed subtype identification of 8 samples, with a predominance of L. pneumophila serogroup-1 subtype-France/Allentown ST23 among clinical isolates. A specific city area was identified as a possible outbreak epicentre in 25/34 (73.5%) cases, although molecular analysis of clinical and environmental specimens revealed heterogeneous subtypes of L. pneumophila.

In order to prevent the disease, immunogenicity and the level of the induction of protective immunity from the recombinant peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (rPAL) against Legionella pneumophila in BALB/c mice was examined. Mice immunized with (rPAL) rapidly increased an antibody response in serum and also displayed a strong activation of both innate and adaptive cell-mediated immunity as determined by antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation, an early production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and in the splenocyte cultures. Infection with a primary sublethal does of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, strain paris, caused resistance to a lethal challenge infection in the animals with 100% survival rate. However, mice treated with rPAL survived with 60% rate in 10 days after a lethal i.v challenge with L. pneumophila. All of the control animals receiving PBS died within 24 h. The present study indicates that recombinant protein PAL of Legionella pneumophila is strongly immunogenic and capable to elicit early innate and adaptive immune responses and lasting immunity against a lethal dose of Legionella pneumophila challenge. Antigenic characterization and immune protection of recombinant protein PAL would be of considerable value in comprehension the immune-pathogenesis of the disease and in development possible vaccine against the Legionella.","['Mobarez AM', 'Rajabi RA', 'Salmanian AH', 'Khoramabadi N', 'Hosseini Doust SR']",2019,128,,Microb Pathog,"Mobarez AM, et al.

30537070,What role does pyroptosis play in microbial infection?,"Pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death mediated by gasdermin, is characterized by the swelling and rupture of cells, release of cellular contents and a strong inflammatory response, which is critical for controlling microbial infection. Pattern recognition receptors recognize the intracellular and extracellular pathogenic microbial components and stimulate the organism's inflammatory response by activating the pyroptosis signaling pathway and releasing interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-18, and other inflammatory factors to promote pathogen clearance and prevent infection. In the process of continuous evolution, pathogens have developed multiple strategies to modulate the occurrence of pyroptosis and thus enhance their ability to induce disease; that is, the competition between host cells and pathogens controls the occurrence of pyroptosis. Competition can directly affect tissue inflammation outbreaks and even alter cell survival. Studies have shown that various bacterial infections, including Shigella flexneri, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and Legionella pneumophila, can lead to pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is associated with the occurrence and development of various diseases caused by microbial infection, and the identification of molecules related to the pyroptosis signaling pathway may provide new drug targets for the treatment of related diseases. This study reviews the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis and the role of pyroptosis in microbial infection-related diseases.","['Xia X', 'Wang X', 'Zheng Y', 'Jiang J', 'Hu J']",2019,234,6,J Cell Physiol,"Xia X, et al.

30536542,Removal Efficacy of Opportunistic Pathogens and Bacterial Community Dynamics in Two Drinking Water Treatment Trains.,"Drinking water treatment processes (DWTPs) impact pathogen colonization and microbial communities in finished water; however, their efficacies against opportunistic pathogens are not fully understood. In this study, the effects of treatment steps on the removal of Legionella spp., Legionella pneumophila, nontuberculous mycobacteria, Mycobacterium avium, and two amoeba hosts (Vermamoeba vermiformis, Acanthamoeba) are evaluated in two parallel trains of DWTPs equipped with different pretreatment units. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrates significantly reduced numbers of total bacteria, Legionella, and mycobacteria during ozonation, followed by a rebound in granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration, whereas sand filtration exerts an overarching effect in removing microorganisms in both treatment trains. V. vermiformis is more prevalent in biofilm (34%) than water samples (7.7%), while Acanthamoeba is not found in the two trains of DWTPs. Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes reveals significant community shifts at different treatment steps, as well as distinct bacterial community structures in water and biofilm samples in parallel units (e.g., ozonation, GAC, sand filtration) between the two trains (analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), p < 0.05), implying the potential influence of different pretreatment steps in shaping the downstream microbiome.

This research aimed at establishing a new oligonucleotide combination that allows for a better exclusion of dead Legionella pneumophila on basis of the mip gene. Propidium monoazide (PMA) was chosen as viability dye. An oligonucleotide combination for the amplification of a 633 bp sequence was established with 100% specificity for different Legionella pneumophila strains compared with 17 other Legionella species tested. Apart from increasing amplicon length, the study aimed at optimizing dye incubation time and temperature. An incubation temperature of 45 °C for 10 min was found optimal. Dye treatment of heat-killed bacteria in the presence of EDTA improved signal suppression, whereas deoxycholate also affected signals from live intact bacteria. Suppression of signals from heat-treated bacteria was found to be approx. twice as efficient compared to a commercial kit, although the detection sensitivity is superior when targeting short amplicons. With a limit of detection of 10 genome copies per PCR well and a 6-log signal reduction of bacteria killed at 80 °C, the assay appears useful for applications where pathogen numbers are not limiting and where the priority is on the distinction between intact and damaged Legionella pneumophila for the evaluation of hygienic risk and of disinfection efficiency.","['Kontchou JA', 'Nocker A']",2019,156,,J Microbiol Methods,Kontchou JA and Nocker A.

We report a case of recurrent Legionnaires' disease in an 86-year-old female patient infected with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, monoclonal antibody-subtype Knoxville, sequence type unknown. Between the two disease incidents the patient had completely recovered. Legionella pneumophila was detected with the monoclonal antibody-subtype Knoxville, sequence type 182, in the drinking water of the patient's apartment. Exposure to contaminated drinking water was interrupted after the first incident exposure through the application of point-of-use water filters. The filters were later removed due to low water pressure, and the second illness occurred thereafter. It is unclear if immunological predisposition has contributed to this case of probable reinfection of Legionnaires' disease. Clinical, microbiological and epidemiological information combined suggest this is a case of reinfection of Legionnaires' disease. In cases of recurrent Legionnaires' disease complete collection of patient and water samples is necessary to differentiate relapse from reinfection cases, to implicate the source of infection and to gain more evidence for the role of immunological predisposition.","['Buchholz U', 'Reber F', 'Lehfeld AS', 'Brodhun B', 'Haas W', 'Schaefer B', 'Stemmler F', 'Otto C', 'Gagell C', 'Lück C', 'Gamradt R', 'Heinig M', 'Meisel C', 'Kölsch U', 'Eisenblätter M', 'Jahn HJ']",2019,222,2,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Buchholz U, et al.

30514915,Novel type of pilus associated with a Shiga-toxigenic E. coli hybrid pathovar conveys aggregative adherence and bacterial virulence.,"A large German outbreak in 2011 was caused by a locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-negative enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strain of the serotype O104:H4. This strain harbors markers that are characteristic of both EHEC and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), including aggregative adhesion fimbriae (AAF) genes. Such rare EHEC/EAEC hybrids are highly pathogenic due to their possession of a combination of genes promoting severe toxicity and aggregative adhesion. We previously identified novel EHEC/EAEC hybrids and observed that one strain exhibited aggregative adherence but had no AAF genes. In this study, a genome sequence analysis showed that this strain belongs to the genoserotype O23:H8, MLST ST26, and harbors a 5.2 Mb chromosome and three plasmids. One plasmid carries some EAEC marker genes, such as aatA and genes with limited protein homology (11-61%) to those encoding the bundle-forming pilus (BFP) of enteropathogenic E. coli. Due to significant protein homology distance to known pili, we designated these as aggregate-forming pili (AFP)-encoding genes and the respective plasmid as pAFP. The afp operon was arranged similarly to the operon of BFP genes but contained an additional gene, afpA2, which is homologous to afpA. The deletion of the afp operon, afpA, or a nearby gene (afpR) encoding an AraC-like regulator, but not afpA2, led to a loss of pilin production, piliation, bacterial autoaggregation, and importantly, a >80% reduction in adhesion and cytotoxicity toward epithelial cells. Gene sets similar to the afp operon were identified in a variety of aatA-positive but AAF-negative intestinal pathogenic E. coli. In summary, we characterized widely distributed and novel fimbriae that are essential for aggregative adherence and cytotoxicity in a LEE-negative Shiga-toxigenic hybrid.","['Lang C', 'Fruth A', 'Holland G', 'Laue M', 'Mühlen S', 'Dersch P', 'Flieger A']",2018,7,1,Emerg Microbes Infect,"Lang C, et al.

We aimed to define the burden and clinical features of invasive group B streptococcal disease in infants younger than 90 days in the UK and Ireland, together with the characteristics of disease-causing isolates.
METHODS: Prospective, active national surveillance of invasive group B streptococcal disease in infants younger than 90 days was done from April 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015, through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit, microbiology reference laboratories, and national public health agencies in the UK and Ireland. Early onset was defined as disease in the first 6 days of life and late onset was defined as 7-89 days of life. Incidence was calculated using livebirths in 2014 (after adjustment for the 13-month surveillance period). Isolates were characterised by serotyping, multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
FINDINGS: 856 cases of group B streptococcus were identified in 2014-15, an incidence of 0·94 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0·88-1·00). Incidence for early-onset disease (n=517) was 0·57 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0·52-0·62), and for late-onset disease (n=339) was 0·37 per 1000 livebirths (0·33-0·41). 53 infants died (case fatality rate 6·2%), of whom 27 had early-onset disease (case fatality rate 5·2%) and 26 had late-onset disease (case fatality rate 7·7%). The predominant serotypes were III (241 [60%] of 402 serotyped isolates) and Ia (69 [17%]); five serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, V) accounted for 377 (94%) of all serotyped isolates.
INTERPRETATION: The incidence of invasive infant group B streptococcal disease in the UK and Ireland has increased since a comparable study done in 2000-01. The burden of early-onset disease has not declined despite the introduction of national prevention guidelines. New strategies for prevention are required.

30479037,The structure of Legionella effector protein LpnE provides insights into its interaction with Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) protein.,"Legionella pneumophila is a freshwater bacterium that replicates in predatory amoeba and alveolar macrophage. The ability of L. pneumophila to thrive in eukaryotic host cells is conferred by the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV). Formation and intracellular trafficking of the LCV are governed by an arsenal of effector proteins, many of which are secreted by the Icm/Dot Type 4 Secretion System. One such effector, known as LpnE (L. pneumophila Entry), has been implicated in facilitating bacterial entry into host cells, LCV trafficking, and substrate translocation. LpnE belongs to a subfamily of tetratricopeptide repeat proteins known as Sel1-like repeats (SLRs). All eight of the predicted SLRs in LpnE are required to promote host cell invasion. Herein, we report that LpnE(1-375) localizes to cis-Golgi in HEK293 cells via its signal peptide (aa 1-22). We further verify the interaction of LpnE(73-375) and LpnE(22-375) with Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe protein (OCRL) residues 10-208, restricting the known interacting residues for both proteins. To further characterize the SLR region of LpnE, we solved the crystal structure of LpnE(73-375) to 1.75Å resolution. This construct comprises all SLRs, which are arranged in a superhelical fold. The α-helices forming the inner concave surface of the LpnE superhelix suggest a potential protein-protein interaction interface.

In general, aerobic biological systems provide an optimum environment for the growth of Legionella due to high organic nitrogen and oxygen concentrations, ideal temperatures and the presence of protozoa. However, few studies have investigated the occurrence of Legionella in WWTPs, and many questions in regards to the interacting factors that promote the proliferation and persistence of Legionella in these treatment systems are still unanswered. This critical review summarizes the current knowledge about Legionella in municipal and industrial WWTPs, the conditions that might support their growth, as well as control strategies that have been applied. Furthermore, an overview of current quantification methods, guidelines and health risks associated with Legionella in reclaimed wastewater is also discussed in depth. A better understanding of the conditions promoting the occurrence of Legionella in WWTPs will contribute to the development of improved wastewater treatment technologies and/or innovative mitigation approaches to minimize future Legionella outbreaks.","['Caicedo C', 'Rosenwinkel KH', 'Exner M', 'Verstraete W', 'Suchenwirth R', 'Hartemann P', 'Nogueira R']",2019,149,,Water Res,"Caicedo C, et al.

Bacterial virulence traits and host immune response.,"Gram-negative bacterium Legionella is able to proliferate intracellularly in mammalian host cells and amoeba, which became known in 1976 since they caused a large outbreak of pneumonia. It had been reported that different strains of Legionella pneumophila, Legionella micdadei, Legionella longbeachae, and Legionella feeleii caused human respiratory diseases, which were known as Pontiac fever or Legionnaires' disease. However, the differences of the virulence traits among the strains of the single species and the pathogenesis of the two diseases that were due to the bacterial virulence factors had not been well elucidated. L. feeleii is an important pathogenic organism in Legionellae, which attracted attention due to cause an outbreak of Pontiac fever in 1981 in Canada. In published researches, it has been found that L. feeleii serogroup 2 (ATCC 35849, LfLD) possess mono-polar flagellum, and L. feeleii serogroup 1 (ATCC 35072, WRLf) could secrete some exopolysaccharide (EPS) materials to the surrounding. Although the virulence of the L. feeleii strain was evidenced that could be promoted, the EPS might be dispensable for the bacteria that caused Pontiac fever. Based on the current knowledge, we focused on bacterial infection in human and murine host cells, intracellular growth, cytopathogenicity, stimulatory capacity of cytokines secretion, and pathogenic effects of the EPS of L. feeleii in this review.","['Wang C', 'Chuai X', 'Liang M']",2019,208,1,Med Microbiol Immunol,"Wang C, et al.

Apart from a few isolated cases in viruses, no functional SH2 domain has been identified to date in prokaryotes. Here we identify 93 SH2 domains from Legionella that are distinct in sequence and specificity from mammalian SH2 domains. The bacterial SH2 domains are not only capable of binding proteins or peptides in a Tyr phosphorylation-dependent manner, some bind pTyr itself with micromolar affinities, a property not observed for mammalian SH2 domains. The Legionella SH2 domains feature the SH2 fold and a pTyr-binding pocket, but lack a specificity pocket found in a typical mammalian SH2 domain for recognition of sequences flanking the pTyr residue. Our work expands the boundary of phosphotyrosine signalling to prokaryotes, suggesting that some bacterial effector proteins have acquired pTyr-superbinding characteristics to facilitate bacterium-host interactions.","['Kaneko T', 'Stogios PJ', 'Ruan X', 'Voss C', 'Evdokimova E', 'Skarina T', 'Chung A', 'Liu X', 'Li L', 'Savchenko A', 'Ensminger AW', 'Li SS']",2018,9,1,Nat Commun,"Kaneko T, et al.

30371137,Control of legionellae in a new healthcare facility following implementation of a thermal control strategy.,"INTRODUCTION: The management of the Legionella risk in hospitals is essentially related to preventive measures of the hot-water supplies.
AIM: To monitor the control of legionellae before and after moving to a new hospital facility.
METHODS: We implemented a survey program based on the surveillance of the temperature of the hot-water supply and detection and counting of Legionella pneumophila and Legionella spp. by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and culture methods.
RESULTS: Our survey program revealed that the hot-water system was colonized by L. pneumophila and Legionella spp. before the arrival of the first patients, despite the implementation of preventive measures. Thus, maintenance on the hot-water production system and subsequent cleaning and superheat disinfection of the hot-water supplies were performed, leading to the eradication of L. pneumophila reservoirs and the decrease of Legionella spp. reservoirs. No reservoirs of L. pneumophila and only rare persistent reservoirs of Legionella spp. were detected after the transfer of hospitalized patients to the new healthcare facility and during the following four years, demonstrating the effectiveness of our corrective measures, without using biocides. L. anisa was identified as the only strain of viable and cultivable Legionella spp. and was undetected during the last year.
CONCLUSIONS: The strict application of our survey program before and after moving to the new hospital associated with strict implementation of corrective measures allowed us to efficiently manage the Legionella-linked risk during this period.","['Lecointe D', 'Beauvais R', 'Breton N', 'Cailleret R', 'Pangon B']",2019,51,2,Infect Dis (Lond),"Lecointe D, et al.

30370624,Evasion of phagotrophic predation by protist hosts and innate immunity of metazoan hosts by Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that has evolved to infect and proliferate within amoebae and other protists. It is thought that accidental inhalation of contaminated water particles by humans is what has enabled this pathogen to proliferate within alveolar macrophages and cause pneumonia. However, the highly evolved macrophages are equipped with more sophisticated innate defence mechanisms than are protists, such as the evolution of phagotrophic feeding into phagocytosis with more evolved innate defence processes. Not surprisingly, the majority of proteins involved in phagosome biogenesis (~80%) have origins in the phagotrophy stage of evolution. There are a plethora of highly evolved cellular and innate metazoan processes, not represented in protist biology, that are modulated by L. pneumophila, including TLR2 signalling, NF-κB, apoptotic and inflammatory processes, histone modification, caspases, and the NLRC-Naip5 inflammasomes. Importantly, L. pneumophila infects haemocytes of the invertebrate Galleria mellonella, kill G. mellonella larvae, and proliferate in and kill Drosophila adult flies and Caenorhabditis elegans. Although coevolution with protist hosts has provided a substantial blueprint for L. pneumophila to infect macrophages, we discuss the further evolutionary aspects of coevolution of L. pneumophila and its adaptation to modulate various highly evolved innate metazoan processes prior to becoming a human pathogen.","['Best AM', 'Abu Kwaik Y']",2019,21,1,Cell Microbiol,Best AM and Abu Kwaik Y.

30355641,Effect of childhood pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on invasive disease in older adults of 10 European countries: implications for adult vaccination.,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have the potential to prevent pneumococcal disease through direct and indirect protection. This multicentre European study estimated the indirect effects of 5-year childhood PCV10 and/or PCV13 programmes on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in older adults across 13 sites in 10 European countries, to support decision-making on pneumococcal vaccination policies.
METHODS: For each site we calculated IPD incidence rate ratios (IRR) in people aged ≥65 years by serotype for each PCV10/13 year (2011-2015) compared with 2009 (pre-PCV10/13). We calculated pooled IRR and 95% CI using random-effects meta-analysis and PCV10/13 effect as (1 - IRR)*100.
RESULTS: After five PCV10/13 years, the incidence of IPD caused by all types, PCV7 and additional PCV13 serotypes declined 9% (95% CI -4% to 19%), 77% (95% CI 67% to 84%) and 38% (95% CI 19% to 53%), respectively, while the incidence of non-PCV13 serotypes increased 63% (95% CI 39% to 91%). The incidence of serotypes included in PCV13 and not in PCV10 decreased 37% (95% CI 22% to 50%) in six PCV13 sites and increased by 50% (95% CI -8% to 146%) in the four sites using PCV10 (alone or with PCV13). In 2015, PCV13 serotypes represented 20-29% and 32-53% of IPD cases in PCV13 and PCV10 sites, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Overall IPD incidence in older adults decreased moderately after five childhood PCV10/13 years in 13 European sites.

30322750,The Importance of Revisiting Legionellales Diversity.,"Bacteria of the order Legionellales, such as Legionella pneumophila, the agent of Legionnaires' disease, and Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, are widely recognized as human pathogens. While our view of the Legionellales is often limited to clinical isolates, ecological surveys are continually uncovering new members of the Legionellales that do not fall into the recognized pathogenic species. Here we emphasize that most of these Legionellales are nonpathogenic forms that have evolved symbiotic lifestyles with nonvertebrate hosts. The diversity of nonpathogenic forms remains, however, largely underexplored. We conjecture that its characterization, once contrasted with the data on pathogenic species, will reveal novel highlights on the mechanisms underlying lifestyle transitions of intracellular bacteria, including the emergence of pathogenesis and mutualism, transmission routes, and host specificity.","['Duron O', 'Doublet P', 'Vavre F', 'Bouchon D']",2018,34,12,Trends Parasitol,"Duron O, et al.

30312149,Spatial structuring of a Legionella pneumophila population within the water system of a large occupational building.,"The diversity of Legionella pneumophila populations within single water systems is not well understood, particularly in those unassociated with cases of Legionnaires' disease. Here, we performed genomic analysis of 235 L. pneumophila isolates obtained from 28 water samples in 13 locations within a large occupational building. Despite regular treatment, the water system of this building is thought to have been colonized by L. pneumophila for at least 30 years without evidence of association with Legionnaires' disease cases. All isolates belonged to one of three sequence types (STs), ST27 (n=81), ST68 (n=122) and ST87 (n=32), all three of which have been recovered from Legionnaires' disease patients previously. Pairwise single nucleotide polymorphism differences amongst isolates of the same ST were low, ranging from 0 to 19 in ST27, from 0 to 30 in ST68 and from 0 to 7 in ST87, and no homologous recombination was observed in any lineage. However, there was evidence of horizontal transfer of a plasmid, which was found in all ST87 isolates and only one ST68 isolate. A single ST was found in 10/13 sampled locations, and isolates of each ST were also more similar to those from the same location compared with those from different locations, demonstrating spatial structuring of the population within the water system. These findings provide the first insights into the diversity and genomic evolution of a L. pneumophila population within a complex water system not associated with disease.","['David S', 'Mentasti M', 'Lai S', 'Vaghji L', 'Ready D', 'Chalker VJ', 'Parkhill J']",2018,4,10,Microb Genom,"David S, et al.

However, according to recent findings, there may be another by-product of this man-made crisis. Failure to use anticorrosive material in the water, a practice mandated by the 1978 Clean Water Act, is being linked to an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, an illness detrimental primarily to adults over 65 years of age. While Legionnaires' disease is relatively rare, it is also likely to remain undiagnosed.

30265290,Pneumococcal and Legionella Urinary Antigen Tests in Community-acquired Pneumonia: Prospective Evaluation of Indications for Testing.,"BACKGROUND: Adult, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) include indications for urinary antigen tests (UATs) for Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and Legionella pneumophila (LP). These recommendations were based on expert opinions and have not been rigorously evaluated.
METHODS: We used data from a multicenter, prospective, surveillance study of adults hospitalized with CAP to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the IDSA/ATS UAT indications for identifying patients who test positive. SP and LP UATs were completed on all included patients. Separate analyses were completed for SP and LP, using 2-by-2 contingency tables, comparing the IDSA/ATS indications (UAT recommended vs not recommended) and UAT results (positive vs negative). Additionally, logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of each individual criterion in the IDSA/ATS indications with positive UAT results.
RESULTS: Among 1941 patients, UATs were positive for SP in 81 (4.2%) and for LP in 32 (1.6%). IDSA/ATS indications had 61% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 49-71%) and 39% specificity (95% CI 37-41%) for SP, and 63% sensitivity (95% CI 44-79%) and 35% specificity (95% CI 33-37%) for LP. No clinical characteristics were strongly associated with positive SP UATs, while features associated with positive LP UATs were hyponatremia, fever, diarrhea, and recent travel.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommended indications for SP and LP urinary antigen testing in the IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines have poor sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with positive tests; future CAP guidelines should consider other strategies for determining which patients should undergo urinary antigen testing.","['Bellew S', 'Grijalva CG', 'Williams DJ', 'Anderson EJ', 'Wunderink RG', 'Zhu Y', 'Waterer GW', 'Bramley AM', 'Jain S', 'Edwards KM', 'Self WH']",2019,68,12,Clin Infect Dis,"Bellew S, et al.

Intact LCVs from infected Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae or RAW 264.7 murine macrophages can be purified using a straightforward protocol. In the first step, the LCVs in cell homogenates are tagged with an antibody directed against an L. pneumophila effector protein specifically localizing to the pathogen vacuole membrane and isolated by immunomagnetic separation using a secondary antibody coupled to magnetic beads. In the second step, the LCVs are further enriched by density gradient centrifugation through a Histodenz cushion. LCVs thus purified are analyzed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics and characterized by biochemical and cell biological approaches.","['Manske C', 'Finsel I', 'Hoffmann C', 'Hilbi H']",2018,1841,,Methods Mol Biol,"Manske C, et al.

30242701,Methods for NAD-Dependent Ubiquitination Catalyzed by Legionella pneumophila Effector Proteins.,"Ubiquitination is one of the most important posttranslational modifications in eukaryotic cells where it regulates the activity, cellular localization, and half-life of proteins. Ubiquitination thus affects many essential cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cell cycle, DNA repair, immune response, and protein homeostasis. The ubiquitin system is exclusive to eukaryotes; however, pathogenic bacteria have developed effective strategies to influence the host ubiquitin system for their own benefit. Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia. This bacterium utilizes a type IV secretion system to translocate more than 300 effector proteins into host cells. These virulence factors modulate a wide spectrum of host processes to support its intracellular survival and replication. Hijacking of host ubiquitin system is an important theme in Legionella virulence, and a number of L. pneumophila effector proteins have been shown to possess ubiquitin ligase or deubiquitinase activity. Among these, members of the SidE family effector proteins (SidEs) catalyze ubiquitination of several ER-associated Rab small GTPases by a mechanism that bypasses the requirement of ATP and the E1, E2 enzymes. Here, we summarize the experimental details of Rab small GTPases ubiquitination catalyzed by SdeA, a member of the SidE family.","['Qiu J', 'Luo ZQ']",2018,1844,,Methods Mol Biol,Qiu J and Luo ZQ.

Primary cutaneous and subcutaneous infection caused by Legionella pneumophila is rare and the diagnosis is challenging.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old Thai woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and myasthenia gravis treated with prednisolone and azathioprine presented to our hospital with low-grade fever, diarrhea, and indurated skin lesions on both thighs. Initial examination showed plaques on both inner thighs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed myositis and swelling of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Diagnosis of panniculitis due to L. pneumophila was carried out by histopathology, Gram stain, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing method of tissue biopsy from multiple sites on both thighs. Myocarditis was diagnosed by echocardiography. The final diagnosis was disseminated extrapulmonary legionellosis. Treatment comprised intravenous azithromycin for 3 weeks and the skin lesions, myositis and myocarditis resolved. Oral azithromycin and ciprofloxacin were continued for 3 months to ensure eradication of the organism. The patient's overall condition improved.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we report the first case of L. pneumophila infection manifesting with panniculitis, possible myositis, and myocarditis in the absence of pneumonia. The diagnosis of extrapulmonary Legionella infection is difficult, especially in the absence of pneumonia. A high index of suspicion and appropriate culture with special media or molecular testing are required.

Here, we show that the L. pneumophila effector protein LegK7 hijacks the conserved Hippo signaling pathway by molecularly mimicking host Hippo kinase (MST1 in mammals), which is the key regulator of pathway activation. LegK7, like Hippo/MST1, phosphorylates the scaffolding protein MOB1, which triggers a signaling cascade resulting in the degradation of the transcriptional regulators TAZ and YAP1. Transcriptome analysis revealed that LegK7-mediated targeting of TAZ and YAP1 alters the transcriptional profile of mammalian macrophages, a key cellular target of L. pneumophila infection. Specifically, genes targeted by the transcription factor PPARγ, which is regulated by TAZ, displayed altered expression, and continuous interference with PPARγ activity rendered macrophages less permissive to L. pneumophila intracellular growth. Thus, a conserved L. pneumophila effector kinase exploits the Hippo pathway to promote bacterial growth and infection.","['Lee PC', 'Machner MP']",2018,24,3,Cell Host Microbe,Lee PC and Machner MP.

30204754,Tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales in Iran: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales cause infections that often manifest as undifferentiated fevers that are not easy to distinguish from other causes of acute febrile illnesses clinically. This is partly attributed to difficulty in laboratory confirmation since convalescent sera, specific diagnostic reagents, and the required expertise may not be readily available. As a result, a number of tick-borne zoonoses are underappreciated resulting in unnecessary morbidity, mortality and huge economic loses. In Iran, a significant proportion of human infectious diseases are tick-borne, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that tick-borne zoonoses are widespread but underreported in the country. Epidemiological review is therefore necessary to aid in the effective control and prevention of tick-borne zonooses in Iran. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth and comprehensive overview of anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever group rickettsioses and coxiellosis in Iran.
METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, all relevant publications on tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales in Iran were searched using a number of search terms. The search was confined to authentic resources from repositories of popular data bases among them PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, SpringerLink and SCOPUS. The search items included peer reviewed journals, books and book chapters published between 1996 and 2017.
RESULTS: A total of 1 205 scientific publications and reports were sourced, of which 63 met the search criteria and were reviewed. Of the 63 articles reviewed, 36 (57.1%) reported on coxiellosis, 15 (23.8%) on anaplasmosis, 11 (17.5%) on ehrlichiosis and 1(1.6%) on spotted fever group rickettsiae in a large scale study involving four countries, among them Iran. The existence of tick-borne pathogens in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales was confirmed by molecular, serological and microscopic techniques conducted on samples obtained from sheep, cattle, goats, camels, poultry, animal products (milk and eggs), dogs, ticks and even human subjects in different parts of the country; pointing to a countrywide distribution.
DISCUSSION: Based on the review, coxiellosis, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and SFG rickettsiae can be categorized as emerging tick-borne zoonotic diseases in Iran given the presence of their causiative agents (C. burnetii, A. phagocytophilum, A. marginale, A. bovis, A. ovis, A. central, E. canis, E. ewingii, E. chaffeensis and R. conorii) collectively reported in a variety of domestic animals, animal products, arthropods and human beings drawn from 22 provinces in Iran.
CONCLUSION: Given the asymptomatic nature of some of these zoonoses, there is a high likelihood of silent transmission to humans in many parts of the country, which should be considered a public health concern. Presently, information on the transmission intensity of tick-borne zoonoses caused by pathogens in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales to humans and its public health impact in Iran is scanty.","['Khamesipour F', 'Dida GO', 'Anyona DN', 'Razavi SM', 'Rakhshandehroo E']",2018,12,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Khamesipour F, et al.

30195090,Diagnostic performance of multiplex PCR on pulmonary samples versus nasopharyngeal aspirates in community-acquired severe lower respiratory tract infections.,"BACKGROUND: PCR-based techniques for the diagnosis of community- acquired severe lower respiratory tract infections are becoming the standard of care. However, their relative ability to identify either atypical bacteria or viruses that cause LRTI from clinical samples from various sources is yet to be determined.
OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic yield of nasopharyngeal aspirates with that of pulmonary samples for the etiological diagnosis of severe acute lower respiratory tract infections by multiplex PCR. Patients were adults with community-acquired pneumonia or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
RESULTS: We obtained concordant results for 81 (79%) of the 103 pairs of samples. In 14 of the 22 discordant results, more pathogens were evidenced in the lower respiratory tract samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary samples had a similar diagnostic sensitivity for virus detection by multiplex PCR as nasopharyngeal aspirates. In contrast, in our study, the diagnostic efficacy of pulmonary samples for Legionella pneumophila over simple aspirates was clearly superior.","['Robert S', 'Lhommet C', 'Le Brun C', 'Garot D', 'Legras A', 'Mankikian J', 'Goudeau A']",2018,108,,J Clin Virol,"Robert S, et al.

METHODS: The study group consisted of 94 patients (37 women and 57 men; mean age 42.03 years) transplanted between 2009 and 2016 at the Silesia Center for Heart Diseases (SCCS). Immunosuppressive treatment (induction and maintenance therapy) was assessed. The immunofluorescence methods were used to detect the P. jiroveci, L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae antigens in samples obtained from the respiratory tract.
RESULTS: Thirty-two of 94 graft recipients developed atypical or opportunistic infection. The median time of its occurrence was 178 days after transplantation. P. jiroveci was responsible for 84.38% of first infections. Five patients developed infection with P. jiroveci and C. pneumoniae. None of the infections occurred during induction of immunosuppression. An opportunistic or atypical infection developed in 19.35% of the patients treated with a tacrolimus-based regimen, and in 43.33% of patients on a cyclosporine-based regimen.
CONCLUSION: Infection with P. jiroveci is a recognized problem after lung transplantation and should be monitored.

30172821,"Discovery, Structural and Biochemical Studies of a rare Glu/Asp Specific M1 Class Aminopeptidase from Legionella pneumophila.","Aminopeptidases catalyze the hydrolysis of amino acids from the N-terminus of protein or peptide substrates. M1 family aminopeptidases are important for the pathogenicity of bacteria and play critical role in many physiological processes such as protein maturation, regulation of peptide hormone levels in humans. Most of the M1 family aminopeptidases reported till date display broad substrates specificity, mostly specific to basic and hydrophobic residues. In the current study we report the discovery of a novel M1 class aminopeptidase from Legionella pneumophila (LePepA), which cleaves only acidic residues. Biochemical and structural studies reveal that the S1 pocket is polar and positively charged. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that such active site is unique to only Legionella species and probably evolved for special needs of the microbe. Given its specific activity, LePepA could be useful in specific biotechnological applications.","['Marapaka AK', 'Pillalamarri V', 'Gumpena R', 'Haque N', 'Bala SC', 'Jangam A', 'Addlagatta A']",2018,120,Pt A,Int J Biol Macromol,"Marapaka AK, et al.

30165781,CASP4/caspase-11 promotes autophagosome formation in response to bacterial infection.,"CASP4/caspase-11-dependent inflammasome activation is important for the clearance of various Gram-negative bacteria entering the host cytosol. Additionally, CASP4 modulates the actin cytoskeleton to promote the maturation of phagosomes harboring intracellular pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila but not those enclosing nonpathogenic bacteria. Nevertheless, this non-inflammatory role of CASP4 regarding the trafficking of vacuolar bacteria remains poorly understood. Macroautophagy/autophagy, a catabolic process within eukaryotic cells, is also implicated in the elimination of intracellular pathogens such as Burkholderia cenocepacia. Here we show that CASP4-deficient macrophages exhibit a defect in autophagosome formation in response to B. cenocepacia infection. The absence of CASP4 causes an accumulation of the small GTPase RAB7, reduced colocalization of B. cenocepacia with LC3 and acidic compartments accompanied by increased bacterial replication in vitro and in vivo. Together, our data reveal a novel role of CASP4 in regulating autophagy in response to B. cenocepacia infection.","['Krause K', 'Caution K', 'Badr A', 'Hamilton K', 'Saleh A', 'Patel K', 'Seveau S', 'Hall-Stoodley L', 'Hegazi R', 'Zhang X', 'Gavrilin MA', 'Amer AO']",2018,14,11,Autophagy,"Krause K, et al.

30157982,Comparison of in situ sequence type analysis of Legionella pneumophila in respiratory tract secretions and environmental samples of a hospital in East Jerusalem.,"Legionella pneumophila genotyping is important for epidemiological investigation of nosocomial and community-acquired outbreaks of legionellosis. The prevalence of legionellosis in pneumonia patients in the West Bank was monitored for the first time, and the sequence types (STs) from respiratory samples were compared with STs of environmental samples from different wards of the hospital. Sputum (n = 121) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (n = 74) specimens were cultured for L. pneumophila; genomic DNA was tested by 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Nested PCR sequence-based typing (NPSBT) was implemented on DNA of the respiratory and environmental PCR-positive samples. Only one respiratory specimen was positive for L. pneumophila by culture. BAL gave a higher percentage of L. pneumophila-positive samples, 35% (26/74) than sputum, 15% (18/121) by PCR. NPSBT revealed the following STs: ST 1 (29%, 7/24), ST 461 (21%, 5/24), ST 1037 (4%, 1/24) from respiratory samples, STs from environmental samples: ST 1 (28.5%, 4/14), ST 187 (21.4%, 3/14) and ST 2070, ST 461, ST 1482 (7.1%, 1/14) each.

The impacts of global warming are already being observed, from rising sea levels and melting snow and ice to changing weather patterns. Scientists state unequivocally that these trends cannot be explained by natural variability in climate alone. Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have warmed the earth by dramatically increasing concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere; as these concentrations increase, the more the earth will warm. Climate change and related extreme weather events are being exacerbated sooner than has previously been considered and are already adversely affecting ecosystems and human health by increasing the burden and type of disease at a local level. Changes to the marine environment and freshwater supplies already affect significant parts of the world's population and warmer temperatures, especially in more temperate regions, may see an increased spread and transmission of diseases usually associated with warmer climes including, for example, cholera and malaria; these impacts are likely to become more severe in a greater number of countries.

This organism is worldwide still relatively unknown and consequently underdiagnosed. However, with an increasing number of confirmed infections in Europe and more specifically in the Netherlands, early awareness and diagnostic measurements are indicated. As routine laboratory techniques like the urine antigen test do not detect L. longbeachae, we advocate early use of specific tests for non-pneumophila Legionella species such as PCR.

30124811,Identification of novel Legionella genes required for endosymbiosis in Paramecium based on comparative genome analysis with Holospora spp.,"The relationship between Legionella and protist hosts has a huge impact when considering the infectious risk in humans because it facilitates the long-term replication and survival of Legionella in the environment. The ciliate Paramecium is considered to be a protist host for Legionella in natural environments, but the details of their endosymbiosis are largely unknown. In this study, we determined candidate Legionella pneumophila genes that are likely to be involved in the establishment of endosymbiosis in Paramecium caudatum by comparing the genomes of Legionella spp. and Holospora spp. that are obligate endosymbiotic bacteria in Paramecium spp. Among the candidate genes, each single deletion mutant for five genes (lpg0492, lpg0522, lpg0523, lpg2141 and lpg2398) failed to establish endosymbiosis in P. caudatum despite showing intracellular growth in human macrophages. The mutants exhibited no characteristic changes in terms of their morphology, multiplication rate or capacity for modulating the phagosomes in which they were contained, but their resistance to lysozyme decreased significantly. This study provides insights into novel factors required by L. pneumophila for endosymbiosis in P. caudatum, and suggests that endosymbiotic organisms within conspecific hosts may have shared genes related to effective endosymbiosis establishment.","['Watanabe K', 'Suzuki H', 'Nishida T', 'Mishima M', 'Tachibana M', 'Fujishima M', 'Shimizu T', 'Watarai M']",2018,94,11,FEMS Microbiol Ecol,"Watanabe K, et al.

The Nile is a major north-flowing river in Africa that displays both spatial and temporal variations in its water quality. Here, we present the first microbiome analysis of the Nile River water in two seasons: (1) summer representing the wet season, and (2) winter representing the dry season, as sampled around Cairo, the capital of Egypt. Surface river water samples were collected from selected locations along the path of river, and the microbial composition was analyzed by next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We found a striking stability in the Nile microbiome community structure along the examined geographical urban sites and between the wet and dry seasons as evidenced by the high proportion of shared operational taxonomic unit values among all samples. The community was dominated by the Cyanobacteria (mainly Synechococcus), Actinobacteria candidate family (ACK-M1), and Proteobacteria (mainly family Comamonadaceae). Among these dominant taxa, Synechococcus exhibited seasonal driven variation in relative abundance. Other taxa were predominantly rare across all seasons and locations, including genera members of which have been implicated as pathogens such as Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, and Legionella. In addition, comparisons with data on freshwater microbiome in other world regions suggest that surface water communities in large rivers exhibit limited variation.

30105799,The single-domain response regulator LerC functions as a connector protein in the Legionella pneumophila effectors regulatory network.,"The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila translocates more than 300 effector proteins into host cells during infection. The PmrAB two-component system (TCS) has been shown to activate the expression of a large pool of these effector-encoding genes (EEGs) and the LetAS TCS, as part of the LetAS-RsmYZ-CsrA cascade, has been shown to repress the expression of another pool of EEGs. We identified a single-domain response regulator (SDRR), named LerC, which functions as a connector protein between the PmrAB and the LetAS TCSs. The lerC gene is strongly activated by the PmrAB TCS and the LerC protein inhibits the activity of the LetAS TCS. The LerC protein specifically interacts with the HPT (histidine-phosphotransfer) domain of LetS, leading to reduced expression of the small RNAs RsmY and RsmZ, which leads to a reduced expression of the pool of EEGs regulated by the LetAS-RsmYZ-CsrA cascade. In addition, the conserved aspartic acid located in the LerC receiver domain is essential for its phosphorylation and function, suggesting that LerC functions as a phosphate-sink of LetS. Our results demonstrate a new role for SDRRs as connector proteins in regulatory networks, suggesting that members of this widespread group of proteins might function as connector proteins in other bacterial regulatory networks.","['Feldheim YS', 'Zusman T', 'Kapach A', 'Segal G']",2018,110,5,Mol Microbiol,"Feldheim YS, et al.

30086926,New system for the detection of Legionella pneumophila in water samples.,"Waterborne pathogens are a global concern for public health worldwide. Despite continuing efforts to maintain water safety, water quality is still affected by deterioration and pollution. Legionella pneumophila colonizes man-made water systems and can infect humans causing Legionnaire's disease (LD), pneumonia. The prevention of LD is a public health issue and requires specific systems to control and detect these microorganisms. Culture plate is the only technique currently approved, but requires more than 10 days to obtain results. A rapid test that inform in hours about the presence of Legionella pneumophila in water samples will improve the control of this pathogen colonization. In order to control colonization by L. pneumophila we developed a membrane filter method to capture and immunodetect this microorganism in water samples. This membrane filter is used to retain the bacteria using a nitrocellulose disc inside a home-made cartridge. Subsequently we perform the immunodetection of the bacteria retained in the nitrocellulose (blocking, antibody incubation, washings and developing). On comparing our test with the gold-standard, the most important finding is the considerably reduction in time maintaining the same detection limit. This rapid test is easily automated for L. pneumophila detection allowing a comprehensive surveillance of L. pneumophila in water facilities and reducing the variability in the analyses due to the low need for manipulation. Moreover, corrective measures may be applied the same day of the analysis. This method considerably reduces the detection time compared with the conventional, gold-standard detection culture method that requires more than 10 days, being decisive to prevent outbreaks.","['Párraga-Niño N', 'Quero S', 'Ventós-Alfonso A', 'Uria N', 'Castillo-Fernandez O', 'Ezenarro JJ', 'Muñoz FX', 'Garcia-Nuñez M', 'Sabrià M']",2018,189,,Talanta,"Párraga-Niño N, et al.

We examined retrospective clinical and environmental isolates of Legionella micdadei and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates with identical PFGE DNA fingerprints sampled over the course of up to 18 years. WGS analyses demonstrated that heterogeneous populations of Legionella were present within each facility despite displaying the same PFGE profiles. Additionally, clustering of some clinical isolates with those from a separate but related institution exposed a source of infection not previously detected, underscoring the importance of considering phylogenetic relationships when assessing epidemiological links. The data supported an average substitution rate of 0.80 SNPs per genome per year for L. micdadei but a reliable estimate for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 could not be obtained due to complicating factors such as non-chronological links among isolates and inadequate sampling depths. While the substitution rate for L. micdadei is consistent with previous estimates for L. pneumophila, the lack of a temporal signal in our sequence data for L. pneuomphila serogroup 1 isolates suggests either insufficient change to provide an estimate or variable evolutionary rates, which could reflect the presence of both actively dividing and viable but non-culturable Legionella spp. in the built environment. This study highlights the increased discriminatory power of WGS SNP analysis as compared to PFGE, emphasizes the need for extended sampling, and provides insight into the evolution of Legionella from longitudinal investigations.","['Wells M', 'Lasek-Nesselquist E', 'Schoonmaker-Bopp D', 'Baker D', 'Thompson L', 'Wroblewski D', 'Nazarian E', 'Lapierre P', 'Musser KA']",2018,65,,Infect Genet Evol,"Wells M, et al.

30075013,Clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of pneumonia in patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis.,"BACKGROUND: To elucidate the characteristics of pneumonia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and to assess whether pneumonia in RA patients differs from that in non-RA patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively divided pneumonia patients into two groups, those with RA and those without RA, and compared the two groups. We evaluated the risk factors for mortality with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Among 1549 patients, 71 had RA. The RA patients with pneumonia were 71.0±8.9 years old, 54.9% were female, 40.9% had a smoking history, and 71.8% had underlying respiratory disease. Female sex, non-smoker, and respiratory comorbidities were statistically more frequent in the RA patients than non-RA patients. The most frequent causative microbial agents of pneumonia in the RA patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and influenza virus, whereas those of pneumonia in non-RA patients were S. pneumoniae, influenza virus, M. pneumoniae, Legionella spp., P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Polymicrobial infection were identified as etiologies more frequently in the RA patients than non-RA patients. Although the severity of pneumonia did not differ between the two groups, mortality was statistically higher in the RA patients than non-RA patients. Multivariate analysis showed RA to be an independent risk factor for mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and polymicrobial infection were statistically more frequent etiologies of pneumonia in the RA patients than non-RA patients. RA itself was found to be an independent risk factor for mortality from pneumonia.","['Wakabayashi A', 'Ishiguro T', 'Takaku Y', 'Miyahara Y', 'Kagiyama N', 'Takayanagi N']",2018,13,8,PLoS One,"Wakabayashi A, et al.

30071124,"Structural characterization of the hypothetical protein Lpg2622, a new member of the C1 family peptidases from Legionella pneumophila.","The Legionella pneumophila type II secretion system can promote bacterial growth under a wide variety of conditions and mediates the secretion of more than 25 proteins, including the uncharacterized effector Lpg2622. Here, we determined the crystal structures of apo-Lpg2622 and Lpg2622 in complex with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64. Structural analysis suggests that Lpg2622 belongs to the C1 family peptidases. Interestingly, unlike the other structurally resolved papain-like cysteine proteases, the propeptide of Lpg2622 forms a novel super-secondary structural fold (hairpin-turn-helix) and can be categorized into a new group. In addition, the N-terminal β-sheet of the Lpg2622 propeptide plays a regulatory role on enzymatic activity. This study enhances our understanding of the classification and regulatory mechanisms of the C1 family peptidases.","['Gong X', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang W', 'Wang J', 'Chen X', 'Hameed MF', 'Zhang N', 'Ge H']",2018,592,16,FEBS Lett,"Gong X, et al.

30070968,A Systematic In Silico Analysis of the Legionellaceae Family for Identification of Novel Drug Target Candidates.,"The family Legionellaceae consists of Gram-negative bacteria that are widely distributed in aquatic environments around the world. This family consists of a single genus, Legionella, that is recognized as an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Legionella consists of intracellular pathogens, thus cellular pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of an antibiotic against these bacteria as well as uptake and subcellular distribution into macrophages should be considered for a successful outcome of disease. Treatment strategies for Legionella infection require a combination of multiple antibiotics. Hence, because of the possible development of resistance to the drugs during therapy, a new alternative targeted therapy is yielding promising results. In this study, a comprehensive in silico target identification pipeline was performed on members of the family Legionellaceae to identify the best targets. Using a homology-based computational pipeline method, new drug targets were identified. Of 4,358 analyzed proteins, 18 proteins, including proteins involved in metabolism (amino acid, energy, and lipid metabolisms), cellular transport, cell division, and cell motility, were selected as the final putative drug targets. These proteins play an important role in the survival and propagation of Legionella infection. In conclusion, homology-based methods could improve the identification of novel drug targets and the drug discovery process, which can potentially be effective for the prevention and treatment of Legionella infections.","['Sohrabi SM', 'Mohammadi M', 'Tabatabaiepour SN', 'Tabatabaiepour SZ', 'Hosseini-Nave H', 'Soltani MF', 'Alizadeh H', 'Hadizadeh M']",2019,25,2,Microb Drug Resist,"Sohrabi SM, et al.

30057173,A Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Effector Alters Phagosomal Maturation to Promote Intracellular Growth of Francisella.,"Many pathogenic intracellular bacteria manipulate the host phago-endosomal system to establish and maintain a permissive niche. The fate and identity of these intracellular compartments is controlled by phosphoinositide lipids. By mechanisms that have remained undefined, a Francisella pathogenicity island-encoded secretion system allows phagosomal escape and replication of bacteria within host cell cytoplasm. Here we report the discovery that a substrate of this system, outside pathogenicity island A (OpiA), represents a family of wortmannin-resistant bacterial phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase enzymes with members found in a wide range of intracellular pathogens, including Rickettsia and Legionella spp. We show that OpiA acts on the Francisella-containing phagosome and promotes bacterial escape into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phenotypic consequences of OpiA inactivation are mitigated by endosomal maturation arrest. Our findings suggest that Francisella, and likely other intracellular bacteria, override the finely tuned dynamics of phagosomal PI(3)P in order to promote intracellular survival and pathogenesis.","['Ledvina HE', 'Kelly KA', 'Eshraghi A', 'Plemel RL', 'Peterson SB', 'Lee B', 'Steele S', 'Adler M', 'Kawula TH', 'Merz AJ', 'Skerrett SJ', 'Celli J', 'Mougous JD']",2018,24,2,Cell Host Microbe,"Ledvina HE, et al.

30040385,Microbial Ecology and Water Chemistry Impact Regrowth of Opportunistic Pathogens in Full-Scale Reclaimed Water Distribution Systems.,"Need for global water security has spurred growing interest in wastewater reuse to offset demand for municipal water. While reclaimed (i.e., nonpotable) microbial water quality regulations target fecal indicator bacteria, opportunistic pathogens (OPs), which are subject to regrowth in distribution systems and spread via aerosol inhalation and other noningestion routes, may be more relevant. This study compares the occurrences of five OP gene markers ( Acanthamoeba spp., Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Naegleria fowleri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in reclaimed versus potable water distribution systems and characterizes factors potentially contributing to their regrowth. Samples were collected over four sampling events at the point of compliance for water exiting treatment plants and at five points of use at four U.S. utilities bearing both reclaimed and potable water distribution systems. Reclaimed water systems harbored unique water chemistry (e.g., elevated nutrients), microbial community composition, and OP occurrence patterns compared to potable systems examined here and reported in the literature. Legionella spp. genes, Mycobacterium spp. genes, and total bacteria, represented by 16S rRNA genes, were more abundant in reclaimed than potable water distribution system samples ( p ≤ 0.0001). This work suggests that further consideration should be given to managing reclaimed water distribution systems with respect to nonpotable exposures to OPs.","['Garner E', 'McLain J', 'Bowers J', 'Engelthaler DM', 'Edwards MA', 'Pruden A']",2018,52,16,Environ Sci Technol,"Garner E, et al.

Anti-Gr-1 treatment induced an M1-to-M2 shift of macrophage subtypes in the lungs and weakly in the peripheral blood, which was associated with increased mortality in legionella-infected mice. CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer cells were the dominant sources of IFN-γ in the acute phase, and anti-Gr-1 treatment reduced the number of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T lymphocytes. In the CD3-gated population, most Gr-1-positive cells were CD8+ T lymphocytes in the lungs and lymph nodes (LNs) of infected mice. Additionally, the number of IFN-γ-producing Gr-1+ CD8+ T lymphocytes in the lungs and LNs increased 2 and 4 days after L. pneumophila infection, with anti-Gr-1 treatment attenuating these populations. Antibody staining revealed that Gr-1+ CD8+ T lymphocytes were Ly6C-positive cells rather than Ly6G, a phenotype regarded as memory type cells. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of Gr-1+ CD8+ T lymphocytes induced increases in IFN-γ, M1 shifting and reduced bacterial number in the Legionella pneumonia model. These data identified Ly6C+ CD8+ T lymphocytes as a source of IFN-γ in innate immunity and partially associated with reduced IFN-γ production, M2 polarization, and high mortality in anti-Gr-1 antibody-treated mice with L. pneumophila pneumonia.","['Kusaka Y', 'Kajiwara C', 'Shimada S', 'Ishii Y', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Inase N', 'Standiford TJ', 'Tateda K']",2018,10,4,J Innate Immun,"Kusaka Y, et al.

30016940,Persistent presence of outer membrane epitopes during short- and long-term starvation of five Legionella pneumophila strains.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaire's disease, may enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state triggered by environmental stress conditions. Specific outer-membrane epitopes of L. pneumophila are used in many diagnostic applications and some of them are linked to important virulence-related factors or endotoxins. However, it is not clear how the presence and status of these epitopes are influenced by environmental stress conditions. In this study, changes of outer membrane epitopes for monoclonal antibodies (mAb) from the Dresden panel and the major outer membrane protein MOMP were analysed for five L. pneumophila strains during short- and long-term starvation in ultrapure water.
RESULTS: With ELISA and single cell immuno-fluorescence analysis, we could show that for most of the investigated mAb-strain combinations the total number of mAb-stained Legionella cells stayed constant for up to 400 days. Especially the epitopes of mAb 3/1, 8/5, 26/1 and 20/1, which are specific for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 subtypes, and the mAb 9/1, specific for serogroup 6, showed long-term persistence. For most mAb- stained cells, a high percentage of viable cells was observed at least until 118 days of starvation. At the same time, we observed a reduction of the fluorescence intensity of the stained cells during starvation indicating a loss of epitopes from the cell surface. However, most of the epitopes, including the virulence-associated mAb 3/1 epitope were still present with high fluorescence intensity after 400 days of starvation in up to 50% of the starved L. pneumophila population.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the continuous presence of outer membrane epitopes of L. pneumophila during short-term and long-term starvation. Thus, culture-independent mAb-based diagnostic and detection tools, such as immuno-magnetic separation and microarray techniques are applicable for both L. pneumophila in the culturable and the VBNC state even after long-term starvation but nevertheless require careful testing before application. However, the mere presence of those epitopes is not necessarily an indication of viability or infectivity.","['Schrammel B', 'Petzold M', 'Cervero-Aragó S', 'Sommer R', 'Lück C', 'Kirschner A']",2018,18,1,BMC Microbiol,"Schrammel B, et al.

30012113,Clinical management of respiratory syndrome in patients hospitalized for suspected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the Paris area from 2013 to 2016.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with suspected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection should be hospitalized in isolation wards to avoid transmission. This suspicion can also lead to medical confusion and inappropriate management of acute respiratory syndrome due to causes other than MERS-CoV.
METHODS: We studied the characteristics and outcome of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection in the isolation wards of two referral infectious disease departments in the Paris area between January 2013 and December 2016.
RESULTS: Of 93 adult patients (49 male (52.6%), median age 63.4 years) hospitalized, 82 out of 93 adult patients had returned from Saudi Arabia, and 74 of them were pilgrims (Hajj). Chest X-ray findings were abnormal in 72 (77%) patients. The 93 patients were negative for MERS-CoV RT-PCR, and 70 (75.2%) patients had documented infection, 47 (50.5%) viral, 22 (23.6%) bacterial and one Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Microbiological analysis identified Rhinovirus (27.9%), Influenza virus (26.8%), Legionella pneumophila (7.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.5%), and non-MERS-coronavirus (6.4%). Antibiotics were initiated in 81 (87%) cases, with two antibiotics in 63 patients (67.7%). The median duration of hospitalization and isolation was 3 days (1-33) and 24 h (8-92), respectively. Time of isolation decreased over time (P < 0.01). Two patients (2%) died.
CONCLUSION: The management of patients with possible MERS-CoV infection requires medical facilities with trained personnel, and rapid access to virological results. Empirical treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and an association of antibiotics effective against S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila are the cornerstones of the management of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection.","['Bleibtreu A', 'Jaureguiberry S', 'Houhou N', 'Boutolleau D', 'Guillot H', 'Vallois D', 'Lucet JC', 'Robert J', 'Mourvillier B', 'Delemazure J', 'Jaspard M', 'Lescure FX', 'Rioux C', 'Caumes E', 'Yazdanapanah Y']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Bleibtreu A, et al.

29998560,Characterization of airborne viromes in cheese production plants.,"AIMS: To characterize airborne virus-like particles isolated from two cheese production plants in order to reveal their complexity in terms of viral communities and microbial genes potentially mobilized by viruses.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Airborne virus-like particles have been isolated from Grana Padano and Gorgonzola PDO cheese production plants and ripening cellars. A shotgun metagenomics analysis of the isolated viromes highlighted a high complexity of the viral communities both in terms of viral taxonomy and phage-host associations. Bacterial reads in each of the viromes were confirmed to be abundant and their taxonomy appeared to be associated with the environmental parameters and the technological processes that characterize the sampling area. Antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in each virome thus confirming that phages could be involved in the mobilization of antimicrobial resistances among bacterial populations. Interestingly human viruses were also identified even if the contamination source was not revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: The environmental conditions, which are imposed by the technology of the dairy process, seam to shape the viral populations as a consequence of the adaptation of microbial taxa to those environments. The identification of sequences belonging to Legionella pneumophila and to the human papillomavirus, raised some considerations about the safety of cheese-ripening cellars.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In conclusion, the analysis of the dairy airborne viromes, has revealed a high complexity of the viral communities even if the environments where the samples were collected were confined environments.

29996477,Continuous and Real-Time Detection of Drinking-Water Pathogens with a Low-Cost Fluorescent Optofluidic Sensor.,"Growing access to tap water and consequent expansion of water distribution systems has created numerous challenges to maintaining water quality between the treatment node and final consumer. Despite all efforts to develop sustainable monitoring systems, there is still a lack of low cost, continuous and real time devices that demonstrate potential for large-scale implementation in wide water distribution networks. The following work presents a study of a low-cost, optofluidic sensor, based on Trypthopan Intrinsic Fluorescence.

29982152,Legionella pneumophila recurrently isolated in a Spanish hospital: Two years of antimicrobial resistance surveillance.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to monitor the spread, persistence and antibiotic resistance patterns of Legionella spp. strains found in a hospital water distribution system. These environmental studies are intended to help detect the presence of antibiotic resistant strains before they infect patients.
METHODS: Antimicrobial surveillance tests were performed at 27 different sampling points of the water network of a large Spanish hospital over two years. Water samples were screened for Legionella according to ISO 11731:2007. Legionella spp. isolates were identified by serotyping and by mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF). Epidemiological molecular typing was done by Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and by Sequence-Based Typing (SBT). Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using disk diffusion and ETEST®.
RESULTS: Legionella spp. were recurrently isolated for 2 years. All isolates belonged the same group, L. pneumophila serogroups 2-14. Isolates were all attributed by SBT to sequence type (ST) ST328, although PFGE revealed 5 different patterns. No significant change in antibiotic susceptibility could be observed for this study period, irrespectively of the method used.
CONCLUSION: Colonization of water systems by Legionella spp. is still occurring, although all the prevention rules were strictly followed. Antibiotic resistance monitoring may help us to find resistance in bacteria with environmental reservoirs but difficult to isolate from patients. The knowledge of the antibiotic susceptibility in environmental strains may help us to predict changes in clinical strains. This study might also help reconsidering Legionnaires' disease (LD) diagnostic methods. L. pneumophila serogroups 2-14 present all along the time of the investigation in the water distribution system can cause LD. However, they may not be detected by routine urine tests run on patients, thereby missing an ongoing LD infection.","['Graells T', 'Hernández-García M', 'Pérez-Jové J', 'Guy L', 'Padilla E']",2018,166,,Environ Res,"Graells T, et al.

29980812,Evaluation of Legiolert for Quantification of Legionella pneumophila from Non-potable Water.,"Legiolert® is a new culture method for quantification of Legionella pneumophila, which is the primary species associated with Legionnaires' disease. The test is based on a most probable number approach, and differs significantly from traditional culture methods by providing results at 7 days, rapid sample preparation and analysis, and objective interpretation of test results. In this study, we compared the performance of Legiolert with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) method for detection of L. pneumophila from non-potable samples, primarily comprising cooling tower waters. Our results demonstrated no significant difference between Legiolert and the CDC method for quantification of L. pneumophila. However, Legiolert showed a significant increase in sensitivity when water samples containing higher L. pneumophila concentrations were examined. Cooling tower waters often contain non-Legionella organisms (NLO) that interfere with traditional Legionella test methods, and we observed varying degrees of NLO interference on many CDC method plates. In contrast, Legiolert was resistant to NLO interference and produced a very low rate of false-positive results. Collectively, Legiolert is a sensitive and specific method for quantification of L. pneumophila from non-potable water that provides advantages over the CDC method.","['Rech MM', 'Swalla BM', 'Dobranic JK']",2018,75,10,Curr Microbiol,"Rech MM, et al.

29972777,Constitutive Interferon Maintains GBP Expression Required for Release of Bacterial Components Upstream of Pyroptosis and Anti-DNA Responses.,"Legionella pneumophila elicits caspase-11-driven macrophage pyroptosis through guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) encoded on chromosome 3. It has been proposed that microbe-driven IFN upregulates GBPs to facilitate pathogen vacuole rupture and bacteriolysis preceding caspase-11 activation. We show here that macrophage death occurred independently of microbial-induced IFN signaling and that GBPs are dispensable for pathogen vacuole rupture. Instead, the host-intrinsic IFN status sustained sufficient GBP expression levels to drive caspase-1 and caspase-11 activation in response to cytosol-exposed bacteria. In addition, endogenous GBP levels were sufficient for the release of DNA from cytosol-exposed bacteria, preceding the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING) pathway for Ifnb induction. Mice deficient for chromosome 3 GBPs were unable to mount a rapid IL-1/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) response during Legionella-induced pneumonia, with defective bacterial clearance. Our results show that rapid GBP activity is controlled by host-intrinsic cytokine signaling and that GBP activities precede immune amplification responses, including IFN induction, inflammasome activation, and cell death.","['Liu BC', 'Sarhan J', 'Panda A', 'Muendlein HI', 'Ilyukha V', 'Coers J', 'Yamamoto M', 'Isberg RR', 'Poltorak A']",2018,24,1,Cell Rep,"Liu BC, et al.

29969060,The presence and prevalence of Legionella spp in collected rainwater and its aerosolisation during common gardening activities.,"AIMS: To determine the presence and prevalence of Legionella spp in domestic rainwater storage butts and to quantify its aerosolisation when collected rainwater is used for common gardening activities.
METHODS: Volunteers were asked to take a water sample from their garden rainwater storage butt. The presence of Legionella was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Two new rainwater storage butts were installed on-site at PHE Porton and positioned in sunlight or in the shade. Ambient conditions and those within the two 'experimental' water butts were continually monitored. A cyclone air sampler was used to detect the presence of Legionella in the air when collected rainwater was poured from a watering can or delivered via a hosepipe attached to a submersible water butt pump.
RESULTS: A total of 63 volunteers provided water samples from 113 different rainwater storage butts. Legionella spp was detected in 107 of these samples at a mean concentration of 4.7 × 10
CONCLUSION: In this study, Legionella spp were common contaminants of collected rainwater. However, the use of rainwater for common gardening activities should not be discouraged. Aerosolisation of Legionella when using a watering can is minimal and any increased risk associated with hose pipe use can be mitigated by using a coarse spray setting.","['Steege L', 'Moore G']",2018,138,5,Perspect Public Health,Steege L and Moore G.

29957436,Prevalence of Legionella in retirement homes and group homes water distribution systems.,"BACKGROUND: Although historically the focus has been placed above all on hospital infections and travel-associated outbreaks, most of the cases of Legionella infection are sporadic and occur in community-dwellers.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence and load of Legionella in hot water systems of non-healthcare facilities that host closed communities. Furthermore, we tried to verify the association between Heterotrophic Plate Counts (HPCs) and presence of Legionella.
METHODS: We collected hot water and biofilm samples from the showerheads of retirement homes and group homes. Samples were tested by culture method for the presence of Legionella. Confirmation and identification were carried out through Latex test and PCR. We determined the HPCs at 22 and 37 °C by the pour plate method. Statistics performed through STATA.
RESULTS: We collected 140 hot water and biofilm samples, 95 from 26 retirement homes and 35 from 9 group homes. Legionella was found in 36.8% samples collected from retirement homes and only in 10.3% group homes' samples (p = 0.01). Legionella was identified more frequently in water than in biofilm (29.8% vs 16.9%); just in one case the pathogen was found in the biofilm only. L. pneumophila sg 1 was the pathogen more frequently isolated (65.8%), with an average load of 2720 CFU/L (SD = 8393 CFU/L). We have often noticed a high microbial contamination (67% of HPCs >200 CFU/mL) and identified a higher prevalence of Legionella for intermediate values of HPC 22 °C (p = 0.011). 32% of people hosted in retirement homes were exposed to Legionella.
CONCLUSIONS: Colonization of water-systems of retirement homes and group homes is anything but occasional, and in our survey it mainly affects the former, moreover often due to L. pneumophila sg 1. The search for the pathogen in the biofilm has proved to be of little use. The relationship between HPC and Legionella deserves further studies.","['De Filippis P', 'Mozzetti C', 'Messina A', ""D'Alò GL""]",2018,643,,Sci Total Environ,"De Filippis P, et al.

29934867,NMR resonance assignments for a ProQ homolog from Legionella pneumophila.,"Regulation of gene expression on a post-transcriptional level by small non-coding regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) is very common in bacteria. sRNAs base pair with sequences in their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and thereby regulate translation initiation or mRNA stability. Specialized RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) facilitate these regulatory sRNA/mRNA interactions by acting as RNA chaperones. A well-known example for such an RNA chaperone which is widespread in bacteria is the Hfq protein. Recently, the ProQ/FinO protein family was identified as a new class of RNA chaperones involved in sRNA based regulation. Only a few members of this protein family have been structurally characterized so far.

METHODS: From September 2012 to February 2014, 341 patients with AECOPD attending outpatient clinics were enrolled as part of a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody titers on the first day of the study and at 36 days post-enrollment. Multiplex PCR was used to test sputum samples for the presence of atypical pathogens. A urinary antigen test for L. pneumophila was performed on the first day.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients (5.6%) showed serological evidence of acute infection with M. pneumoniae. Also, one and seven patients (2%) showed serological evidence of acute infection with C. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, respectively. All DNA samples were negative for M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila according to PCR. Only one urine sample was positive for L. pneumophila antigen, but serologic evidence was lacking.
CONCLUSION: Serological testing suggested that infection by atypical pathogens during AECOPD was relatively uncommon. In addition, PCR provided no direct evidence of infection by atypical pathogens. Thus, atypical pathogens may not be a major cause of AECOPD in South Korea.","['Jung CY', 'Choe YH', 'Lee SY', 'Kim WJ', 'Lee JD', 'Ra SW', 'Choi EG', 'Lee JS', 'Park MJ', 'Na JO']",2018,33,5,Korean J Intern Med,"Jung CY, et al.

29894640,Interactions of a Bacterial Cu(I)-ATPase with a Complex Lipid Environment.,"Phospholipids and sterols play multiple roles in cells. In addition to establishing barriers between compartments, they also provide the matrix for assembly and function of a large variety of catalytic processes. Lipid composition is a highly regulated feature of biological membranes, yet its implications for membrane proteins are difficult problems to approach. One obstacle is the inherent complexity of observing and describing these interactions and their dynamics at a molecular and atomic level. However, lipid interactions are pivotal for membrane protein function and should be acknowledged. The enzymatic activity of several different P-type ATPases, one of the major families of ion pumping primary active transporters, has previously been shown to exhibit a strong dependence on phospholipids; however, distinguishing the effects of annular and specific lipid interactions is challenging. Here we show that the hydrolytic activity of a bacterial Cu(I)-transporting P-type ATPase (LpCopA) is stimulated by the bacterial, anionic phospholipid cardiolipin and to some extent by phosphatidylglycerol. Furthermore, multiscale molecular dynamics simulations pinpoint lipid hot spots on the membrane-spanning domain of LpCopA. Thus, using two independent methods, our study shows converging evidence that the lipid membrane composition plays an important role for LpCopA.","['Autzen HE', 'Koldsø H', 'Stansfeld PJ', 'Gourdon P', 'Sansom MSP', 'Nissen P']",2018,57,28,Biochemistry,"Autzen HE, et al.

The students and teachers (17-41 years) shared meals in a hotel. Active case finding revealed further cases among German school groups from North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, staying at the same hotel in February 2017. We conducted two retrospective cohort studies using self-administered questionnaires on clinical symptoms and food consumption. We defined a case as a trip participant in February 2017, staying at the aforementioned hotel and developing diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain during or within ten days after the trip and/or who had a stool sample tested positive for STEC within four weeks after the trip. During the outbreak investigation, Austrian authorities detected that unlabeled raw cow milk delivered by a dairy farm had been offered at the hotel for breakfast during January and February 2017. Stool samples of participants, samples of milk served in the hotel and fecal samples of various animals kept at the milk-delivering farm were examined by culture and polymerase chain reaction. STEC isolates were typed using Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS). All 25 participants from Lower Saxony completed the questionnaire on symptoms and milk consumption; 14 were cases (56%). Thirteen of 20 participants who had consumed cold milk fell ill (risk ratio (RR): 3.25; 95%-confidence interval (CI): 0.55-19.32). Of 159 trip participants from North Rhine-Westphalia, 81 completed the questionnaire (51%), 25 were cases (31%); RR for cold milk was 2.11 (CI: 0.89-5.03). The combined RR for cold milk in both groups was 2.49 (CI: 1.16-5.35). Shiga toxin 1a-gene and eaeA-gene positive STEC O103:H2 were detected in nine of 32 patients' stool samples and in two of 18 dairy farm cattle. Nine isolates from human stool samples and two isolates from cattle fecal samples yielded the same strain with an almost identical PFGE-pattern and WGS-profile. Microbiological and epidemiological evidence identified raw cow milk as the vehicle. Results may have been compromised by misclassification of cases due to a recall bias and mild symptoms. As a result of this outbreak investigation, the Austrian authorities enforced Austrian law in the hotel, to provide milk only when pasteurized. We recommend re-emphasizing the risk of raw milk consumption to providers.","['Mylius M', 'Dreesman J', 'Pulz M', 'Pallasch G', 'Beyrer K', 'Claußen K', 'Allerberger F', 'Fruth A', 'Lang C', 'Prager R', 'Flieger A', 'Schlager S', 'Kalhöfer D', 'Mertens E']",2018,308,5,Int J Med Microbiol,"Mylius M, et al.

29877714,Culture-Independent Analysis of Pediatric Bronchoalveolar Lavage Specimens.,"RATIONALE: The clinical utility of culture-independent testing of pediatric BAL specimens is unknown. In addition, the variability of the pediatric pulmonary microbiome with patient characteristics is not well understood.
OBJECTIVES: To compare testing with 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing to conventional cultures of BAL specimens in children Methods: Study subjects were not more than 22 years old and underwent BAL from May 2013 to August 2015 as part of clinical care. DNA extracted from BAL specimens was used for 16S rRNA gene-based analysis, and results were compared with routine cultures from the same samples. Indices of microbial diversity and relative taxon abundances were compared on the basis of subject characteristics (diagnosis and antibiotic use).
RESULTS: From 81 participants (male, 51%; median age, 9 yr), 89 samples were collected. The 16S rRNA genes of 77 samples (86.5%) from 70 subjects were successfully analyzed. These 70 subjects included 23 with cystic fibrosis, 19 who were immunocompromised, and 28 who were nonimmunocompromised. Of 68 organisms identified in culture, 16S rRNA gene-based analyses detected corresponding taxa in 66 (97.1%) and also identified potentially clinically significant organisms missed by cultures (e.g., Staphylococcus, Legionella, and Pseudomonas). Taxa that varied significantly with diagnosis and antibiotic use included Veillonella, Corynebacterium, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus. The microbiota of cystic fibrosis samples was less diverse. A ""core"" group of 15 taxa present in all three diagnosis groups was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Culture-independent analysis was concordant with routine cultures and showed the potential to detect noncultured pathogens. Although culture-independent testing identified relative changes in organism abundance associated with clinical characteristics, distinct microbiome profiles associated with disease states were not identified.","['Zachariah P', 'Ryan C', 'Nadimpalli S', 'Coscia G', 'Kolb M', 'Smith H', 'Foca M', 'Saiman L', 'Planet PJ']",2018,15,9,Ann Am Thorac Soc,"Zachariah P, et al.

29864633,Control and prevention measures for legionellosis in hospitals: A cross-sectional survey in Italy.,"Risk assessment, environmental monitoring, and the disinfection of water systems are the key elements in preventing legionellosis risk. The Italian Study Group of Hospital Hygiene of the Italian Society of Hygiene, Preventive Medicine, and Public Health and the Italian Multidisciplinary Society for the Prevention of Health Care-Associated Infections carried out a national cross-sectional survey to investigate the measures taken to prevent and control legionellosis in Italian hospitals. A multiple-choice questionnaire was developed, comprising 71 questions regarding hospital location, general characteristics, clinical and environmental surveillance, and control and preventive measures for legionellosis in 2015. Overall, 739 hospitals were enrolled from February to June 2017, and 178 anonymous questionnaires were correctly completed and evaluated (response rate: 24.1%). The survey was conducted using the SurveyMonkey® platform, and the data were analyzed using Stata 12 software. Of the participating hospitals, 63.2% reported at least one case of legionellosis, of which 28.2% were of proven nosocomial origin. The highest case numbers were reported in the Northern Italy, in hospitals with a pavilion structure or cooling towers, and in hospitals with higher numbers of beds, wards and operating theaters. Laboratory diagnosis was performed using urinary antigen testing alone (31.9%), both urinary antigen testing and single antibody titer (17.8%), or with seroconversion also added (21.5%). Culture-based or molecular investigations were performed in 28.8% and 22.1% of the clinical specimens, respectively. The water systems were routinely tested for Legionella in 97.4% of the hospitals, 62% of which detected a positive result (> 1000 cfu/L). Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2-15 was the most frequently isolated species (58.4%). The most common control measures were the disinfection of the water system (73.7%), mostly through thermal shock (37.4%) and chlorine dioxide (34.4%), and the replacement (69.7%) or cleaning (70.4%) of faucets and showerheads. A dedicated multidisciplinary team was present in 52.8% of the hospitals, and 73% of the hospitals performed risk assessment. Targeted training courses were organized in 36.5% of the hospitals, involving nurses (30.7%), physicians (28.8%), biologists (21.5%), technicians (26.4%), and cleaners (11%). Control and prevention measures for legionellosis are present in Italian hospitals, but some critical aspects should be improved. More appropriate risk assessment is necessary, especially in large facilities with a high number of hospitalizations. Moreover, more sensitive diagnostic tests should be used, and dedicated training courses should be implemented.","['Montagna MT', 'De Giglio O', 'Napoli C', 'Diella G', 'Rutigliano S', 'Agodi A', 'Auxilia F', 'Baldovin T', 'Bisetto F', 'Arnoldo L', 'Brusaferro S', 'Busetti M', 'Calagreti G', 'Casini B', 'Cristina ML', 'Di Luzio R', 'Fiorio M', 'Formoso M', 'Liguori G', 'Martini E', 'Molino A', 'Mondello P', 'Mura I', 'Novati R', 'Orsi GB', 'Patroni A', 'Poli A', 'Privitera G', 'Ripabelli G', 'Rocchetti A', 'Rose F', 'Sarti M', 'Savini S', 'Silvestri A', 'Sodano L', 'Spagnolo AM', 'Tardivo S', 'Teti V', 'Torregrossa MV', 'Torri E', 'Veronesi L', 'Zarrilli R', 'Pacifico C', 'Goglio A', 'Moro M', 'Pasquarella C']",2018,166,,Environ Res,"Montagna MT, et al.

29844490,Mammalian Solute Carrier (SLC)-like transporters of Legionella pneumophila.,"Acquisition of nutrients during intra-vacuolar growth of L. pneumophila within macrophages or amoebae is poorly understood. Since many genes of L. pneumophila are acquired by inter-kingdom horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotic hosts, we examined the presence of human solute carrier (SLC)-like transporters in the L. pneumophila genome using I-TASSER to assess structural alignments. We identified 11 SLC-like putative transporters in L. pneumophila that are structurally similar to SLCs, eight of which are amino acid transporters, and one is a tricarboxylate transporter. The two other transporters, LstA and LstB, are structurally similar to the human glucose transporter, SLC2a1/Glut1. Single mutants of lstA or lstB have decreased ability to import, while the lstA/lstB double mutant is severely defective for uptake of glucose. While lstA or lstB single mutants are not defective in intracellular proliferation within Acanthamoeba polyphaga and human monocyte-derived macrophages, the lstA/lstB double mutant is severely defective in both host cells. The two phenotypic defects of the lstA/lstB double mutant in uptake of glucose and intracellular replication are both restored upon complementation of either lstA or lstB. Our data show that the two glucose transporters, LstA and LstB, are redundant and are required for intracellular replication within human macrophages and amoebae.","['Best A', 'Jones S', 'Abu Kwaik Y']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,"Best A, et al.

Legionellae are responsible for Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia in humans with high lethality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The developed method is based on a nutritional stimulation and detection of an increase in precursor 16S rRNA as an indicator for viability. For quantification, DNA was detected by qPCR. This method was compared to the ISO method using water samples obtained from public sports facilities in Switzerland. The sensitivity and specificity were 91 and 97%, respectively, when testing samples for compliance with a microbiological criterion of 1000 cell equivalents per l.
CONCLUSION: The new method is sensitive and specific for Leg. pneumophila and allows results to be obtained within 8 h upon arrival, compared to one week or more by the ISO method.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The method represents a useful tool for a rapid detection of viable Leg. pneumophila of all serogroups in water by molecular biology. It can be used as an alternative to the ISO method for official water analysis for legionellae and particularly when a short test time is required.","['Boss R', 'Baumgartner A', 'Kroos S', 'Blattner M', 'Fretz R', 'Moor D']",2018,125,4,J Appl Microbiol,"Boss R, et al.

29795342,Structural basis of ubiquitin modification by the Legionella effector SdeA.,"Protein ubiquitination is a multifaceted post-translational modification that controls almost every process in eukaryotic cells. Recently, the Legionella effector SdeA was reported to mediate a unique phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination through successive modifications of the Arg42 of ubiquitin (Ub) by its mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (mART) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) domains. However, the mechanisms of SdeA-mediated Ub modification and phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination remain unknown. Here we report the structures of SdeA in its ligand-free, Ub-bound and Ub-NADH-bound states. The structures reveal that the mART and PDE domains of SdeA form a catalytic domain over its C-terminal region. Upon Ub binding, the canonical ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin turn-turn (ARTT) and phosphate-nicotinamide (PN) loops in the mART domain of SdeA undergo marked conformational changes. The Ub Arg72 might act as a 'probe' that interacts with the mART domain first, and then movements may occur in the side chains of Arg72 and Arg42 during the ADP-ribosylation of Ub. Our study reveals the mechanism of SdeA-mediated Ub modification and provides a framework for further investigations into the phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination process.","['Dong Y', 'Mu Y', 'Xie Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Han Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Wang W', 'Liu Z', 'Wu M', 'Wang H', 'Pan M', 'Xu N', 'Xu CQ', 'Yang M', 'Fan S', 'Deng H', 'Tan T', 'Liu X', 'Liu L', 'Li J', 'Wang J', 'Fang X', 'Feng Y']",2018,557,7707,Nature,"Dong Y, et al.

29794542,Legionella: a reemerging pathogen.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review summarizes new knowledge about Legionella epidemiology, clinical characteristics, community-associated and hospital-based outbreaks, molecular typing and molecular epidemiology, prevention, and detection in environmental and clinical specimens.
RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of Legionnaire's disease is rising and the mortality rate remains high, particularly for immunocompromised patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may help support patients with severe respiratory failure. Fluoroquinolones and macrolides appear to be equally efficacious for treating Legionnaires' disease. Whole genome sequencing is an important tool for determining the source for Legionella infections and for understanding routes of transmission and mechanisms by which new pathogenic clones emerge. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing of respiratory specimens may improve our ability to diagnose Legionnaire's disease. The frequency of viable but nonculturable organisms is quite high in some water systems but their role in causing clinical disease has not been defined.
SUMMARY: Legionellosis remains an important public health threat. To prevent these infections, staff of municipalities and large buildings must implement effective water system management programs that reduce Legionella growth and transmission and all Medicare-certified healthcare facilities must have water management policies. In addition, we need better methods for detecting Legionella in water systems and in clinical specimens to improve prevention strategies and clinical diagnosis.","['Herwaldt LA', 'Marra AR']",2018,31,4,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Herwaldt LA and Marra AR.

29787733,"The major outer membrane protein of Legionella pneumophila Lpg1974 shows pore-forming characteristics similar to the human mitochondrial outer membrane pore, hVDAC1.","Legionella pneumophila is an aerobic and nonspore-forming pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium of the genus Legionella. It is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, also known as Legionellosis. The hosts of this organism are diverse, ranging from simple water borne protozoans such as amoebae to more complex hosts such as macrophages in humans. Genome analyses have shown the presence of genes coding for eukaryotic like proteins in several Legionella species. The presence of these proteins may assist L. pneumophila in its adaptation to the eukaryotic host. We studied the characteristics of a protein (Lpg1974) of L. pneumophila that shows remarkable homologies in length of the primary sequence and for the identity/homology of many amino acids to the voltage dependent anion channel (human VDAC1, Porin 31HL) of human mitochondria. Two different forms of Lpg1974 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity: the one containing a putative N-terminal signal sequence and one without it. Reconstituted protein containing the signal sequence formed ion-permeable pores in lipid bilayer membranes with a conductance of approximately 5.4 nS in 1 M KCl. When the predicted N-terminal signal peptide of Lpg1974 comprising an α-helical structure similar to that at the N-terminus of hVDAC1 was removed, the channels formed in reconstitution experiments had a conductance of 7.6 nS in 1 M KCl. Both Lpg1974 proteins formed pores that were voltage-dependent and anion-selective similar to the pores formed by hVDAC1. These results suggest that Lpg1974 of L. pneumophila is indeed a structural and functional homologue to hVDAC1.","['Younas F', 'Soltanmohammadi N', 'Knapp O', 'Benz R']",2018,1860,8,Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,"Younas F, et al.

29770512,X-ray crystal structures of the type IVb secretion system DotB ATPases.,"Human infections by the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila result in a severe form of pneumonia, the Legionnaire's disease. L. pneumophila utilizes a Type IVb secretion (T4bS) system termed ""dot/icm"" to secrete protein effectors to the host cytoplasm. The dot/icm system is powered at least in part by a functionally critical AAA+ ATPase, a protein called DotB, thought to belong to the VirB11 family of proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of DotB at 3.19 Å resolution, in its hexameric form. We observe that DotB is in fact a structural intermediate between VirB11 and PilT family proteins, with a PAS-like N-terminal domain coupled to a RecA-like C-terminal domain. It also shares critical structural elements only found in PilT. The structure also reveals two conformers, termed α and β, with an αβαβαβ configuration. The existence of α and β conformers in this class of proteins was confirmed by solving the structure of DotB from another bacterial pathogen, Yersinia, where, intriguingly, we observed an ααβααβ configuration. The two conformers co-exist regardless of the nucleotide-bound states of the proteins. Our investigation therefore reveals that these ATPases can adopt a wider range of conformational states than was known before, shedding new light on the extraordinary spectrum of conformations these ATPases can access to carry out their function. Overall, the structure of DotB provides a template for further rational drug design to develop more specific antibiotics to tackle Legionnaire's disease.

29748997,The recycling endosome and bacterial pathogens.,"Bacterial pathogens have developed a wide range of strategies to survive within human cells. A number of pathogens multiply in a vacuolar compartment, whereas others can rupture the vacuole and replicate in the host cytosol. A common theme among many bacterial pathogens is the use of specialised secretion systems to deliver effector proteins into the host cell. These effectors can manipulate the host's membrane trafficking pathways to remodel the vacuole into a replication-permissive niche and prevent degradation. As master regulators of eukaryotic membrane traffic, Rab GTPases are principal targets of bacterial effectors. This review highlights the manipulation of Rab GTPases that regulate host recycling endocytosis by several bacterial pathogens, including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Uropathogenic Escherichia coli, and Legionella pneumophila. Recycling endocytosis plays key roles in a variety of cellular aspects such as nutrient uptake, immunity, cell division, migration, and adhesion. Though much remains to be understood about the molecular basis and the biological relevance of bacterial pathogens exploiting Rab GTPases, current knowledge supports the notion that endocytic recycling Rab GTPases are differentially targeted to avoid degradation and support bacterial replication. Thus, future studies of the interactions between bacterial pathogens and host endocytic recycling pathways are poised to deepen our understanding of bacterial survival strategies.","['Allgood SC', 'Neunuebel MR']",2018,20,7,Cell Microbiol,Allgood SC and Neunuebel MR.

29742157,An optimal set of features for predicting type IV secretion system effector proteins for a subset of species based on a multi-level feature selection approach.,"Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell's machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, Legionella pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp, and Bartonella spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.","['Esna Ashari Z', 'Dasgupta N', 'Brayton KA', 'Broschat SL']",2018,13,5,PLoS One,"Esna Ashari Z, et al.

29733858,The Legionella pneumophila Methyltransferase RomA Methylates Also Non-histone Proteins during Infection.,"RomA is a SET-domain containing protein lysine methyltransferase encoded by the Gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila. It is exported into human host cells during infection and has been previously shown to methylate histone H3 at lysine 14 [Rolando et al. (2013), Cell Host Microbe, 13, 395-405]. Here, we investigated the substrate specificity of RomA on peptide arrays showing that it mainly recognizes a G-K-X-(PA) sequence embedded in a basic amino acid sequence context. Based on the specificity profile, we searched for possible additional RomA substrates in the human proteome and identified 34 novel peptide substrates. For nine of these, the corresponding full-length protein or protein domains could be cloned and purified. Using radioactive and antibody-based methylation assays, we showed that seven of them are methylated by RomA, four of them strongly, one moderately, and two weakly. Mutagenesis confirmed for the seven methylated proteins that methylation occurs at target lysine residues fitting to the specificity profile. Methylation of one novel substrate (AROS) was investigated in HEK293 cells overexpressing RomA and during infection with L. pneumophila. Methylation could be detected in both conditions, confirming that RomA methylates non-histone proteins in human cells. Our data show that the bacterial methyltransferase RomA methylates also human non-histone proteins suggesting a multifaceted role in the infection process.","['Schuhmacher MK', 'Rolando M', 'Bröhm A', 'Weirich S', 'Kudithipudi S', 'Buchrieser C', 'Jeltsch A']",2018,430,13,J Mol Biol,"Schuhmacher MK, et al.

29731171,Structural Insights into Non-canonical Ubiquitination Catalyzed by SidE.,"Ubiquitination constitutes one of the most important signaling mechanisms in eukaryotes. Conventional ubiquitination is catalyzed by the universally conserved E1-E2-E3 three-enzyme cascade in an ATP-dependent manner. The newly identified SidE family effectors of the pathogen Legionella pneumophila ubiquitinate several human proteins by a different mechanism without engaging any of the conventional ubiquitination machinery. We now report the crystal structures of SidE alone and in complex with ubiquitin, NAD, and ADP-ribose, thereby capturing different conformations of SidE before and after ubiquitin and ligand binding. The structures of ubiquitin bound to both mART and PDE domains reveal several unique features of the two reaction steps catalyzed by SidE. Further, the structural and biochemical results demonstrate that SidE family members do not recognize specific structural folds of the substrate proteins. Our studies provide both structural explanations for the functional observations and new insights into the molecular mechanisms of this non-canonical ubiquitination machinery.","['Wang Y', 'Shi M', 'Feng H', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu S', 'Gao A', 'Gao P']",2018,173,5,Cell,"Wang Y, et al.

29729999,Environmental sources of community-acquired legionnaires' disease: A review.,"BACKGROUND: Most Legionnaires' disease in the US and abroad is community-acquired and believed to be sporadic, or non-outbreak associated. Most patients are exposed to numerous water sources, thus making it difficult to focus environmental investigations. Identifying known sources of sporadic community-acquired Legionnaires' disease will inform future sporadic Legionnaires' disease investigations as well as highlight directions for research. The objective is to summarize and rank sporadic Legionnaires' disease sources based on the level of linkage between the environmental source and cases.
METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted using the search terms legion* and (origins or source or transmission) and (sporadic or community-acquired). Studies of nosocomial and/or outbreak-associated disease were excluded from this review. Definite, probable, possible and suspect ranks were assigned to sources based on evidence of linkage to sporadic Legionnaires' disease.
RESULTS: The search yielded 196 articles and 47 articles were included in the final review after application of exclusion criteria. A total of 28 sources were identified. Of these, eight were assigned definite rank including residential potable water and car air-conditioner water leakage. Probable rank was assigned to five sources including solar-heated potable water and soil. Possible rank was assigned to nine sources including residential potable water and cooling towers. Suspect rank was assigned to 20 sources including large building water systems and cooling towers.
CONCLUSION: Residential potable water, large building water systems and car travel appear to contribute to a substantial proportion of sporadic Legionnaires' disease. Cooling towers are also a potentially significant source; however, definitive linkage to sporadic cases proves difficult. The sources of sporadic Legionnaires' disease cannot be definitively identified for most cases.","['Orkis LT', 'Harrison LH', 'Mertz KJ', 'Brooks MM', 'Bibby KJ', 'Stout JE']",2018,221,5,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Orkis LT, et al.

29712912,The LetA/S two-component system regulates transcriptomic changes that are essential for the culturability of Legionella pneumophila in water.,"Surviving the nutrient-poor aquatic environment for extended periods of time is important for the transmission of various water-borne pathogens, including Legionella pneumophila (Lp). Previous work concluded that the stringent response and the sigma factor RpoS are essential for the survival of Lp in water. In the present study, we investigated the role of the LetA/S two-component signal transduction system in the successful survival of Lp in water. In addition to cell size reduction in the post-exponential phase, LetS also contributes to cell size reduction when Lp is exposed to water. Importantly, absence of the sensor kinase results in a significantly lower survival as measured by CFUs in water at various temperatures and an increased sensitivity to heat shock. According to the transcriptomic analysis, LetA/S orchestrates a general transcriptomic downshift of major metabolic pathways upon exposure to water leading to better culturability, and likely survival, suggesting a potential link with the stringent response. However, the expression of the LetA/S regulated small regulatory RNAs, RsmY and RsmZ, is not changed in a relAspoT mutant, which indicates that the stringent response and the LetA/S response are two distinct regulatory systems contributing to the survival of Lp in water.","['Mendis N', 'McBride P', 'Saoud J', 'Mani T', 'Faucher SP']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,"Mendis N, et al.

29705157,Community acquired pneumonia by Legionella pneumophila: Study of 136 cases.,"OBJECTIVE: Most of the data on Legionella pneumonia in our country come from the Mediterranean area, and there are few studies from the Northwest area. This study tries to assess the situation of this infection in this area.
METHOD: Retrospective study of all patients with positive Legionella antigenuria treated at the University Hospital Lucus Augusti in Lugo (Spain) from 2001, the year in which this test was introduced in our centre, until 2015. We analysed epidemiological data, risk factors, clinical, radiological and biochemical findings, and clinical outcome.
RESULTS: The sampled included 136 patients. When comparing the first five years of the study with the last five, the incidence increased from 10.9 to 64.5 cases/1,000,000; the number of antigenuria requests increased 3.4 times, and compared to other pneumonia aetiologies Legionella increased from 0.9% to 15%. The mean age was 64.1years and 84.6% were males; 74.3% had comorbidities. Males were significantly younger (62.7±16.6 vs 71.9±17.3) and consumed more alcohol (26.1% vs 0%) and tobacco (67.8% vs 14.3%). Diagnosis was established within the first 72hours in 88.9% of cases and most received levofloxacin (95.6%). Hospitalisation was needed in 85% of cases, 11.7% in ICU and 4.4% died.
CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of antigenuria there was an increase in the incidence of Legionella pneumonia recorded in our health area. Its rate in recent years has been one of the highest in our country. Despite the fact that the patients had advanced age and comorbidities, mortality was low.","['Romay-Lema E', 'Corredoira-Sánchez J', 'Ventura-Valcárcel P', 'Iñiguez-Vázquez I', 'García Pais MJ', 'García-Garrote F', 'Rabuñal Rey R']",2018,151,7,Med Clin (Barc),"Romay-Lema E, et al.

29703496,Emerging Role of Retromer in Modulating Pathogen Growth.,"Intracellular pathogens have developed elegant mechanisms to modulate host endosomal trafficking. The highly conserved retromer pathway has emerged as an important target of viruses and intravacuolar bacteria. Some pathogens require retromer function to survive. For others, retromer activity restricts intracellular growth; these pathogens must disrupt retromer function to survive. In this review, we discuss recent paradigm changes to the current model for retromer assembly and cargo selection. We highlight how the study of pathogen effectors has contributed to these fundamental insights, with a special focus on the biology and structure of two recently described bacterial effectors, Chlamydia trachomatis IncE and Legionella pneumophila RidL. These two pathogens employ distinct strategies to target retromer components and overcome restriction of intracellular growth imposed by retromer.","['Elwell C', 'Engel J']",2018,26,9,Trends Microbiol,Elwell C and Engel J.

To benefit its survival and replication in cellular milieu, L. pneumophila secrets at least 330 effector proteins into host cells. We found that the effector WipA has the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity but does not depend on the classical CX5R motif for activity, suggesting that WipA is an unconventional PTP. Meanwhile, the presence of three other highly conserved motifs typically seen in protein serine/threonine phosphatases and the poor inhibition of WipA activity by okadaic acid led us to propose that WipA is a bacterial protein phosphatase. In addition, the determination of the 2.55-Å crystal structure of WipA revealed that WipA resembles cold-active protein tyrosine phosphatase (CAPTPase), and therefore very likely shares the same catalytic mechanism.","['Jia Q', 'Lin Y', 'Gou X', 'He L', 'Shen D', 'Chen D', 'Xie W', 'Lu Y']",2018,50,6,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),"Jia Q, et al.

29691989,Targeting of RNA Polymerase II by a nuclear Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm effector SnpL.,"The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila influences numerous eukaryotic cellular processes through the Dot/Icm-dependent translocation of more than 300 effector proteins into the host cell. Although many translocated effectors localise to the Legionella replicative vacuole, other effectors can affect remote intracellular sites. Following infection, a subset of effector proteins localises to the nucleus where they subvert host cell transcriptional responses to infection. Here, we identified Lpw27461 (Lpp2587), Lpg2519 as a new nuclear-localised effector that we have termed SnpL. Upon ectopic expression or during L. pneumophila infection, SnpL showed strong nuclear localisation by immunofluorescence microscopy but was excluded from nucleoli. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we determined the host-binding partner of SnpL as the eukaryotic transcription elongation factor, Suppressor of Ty5 (SUPT5H)/Spt5. SUPT5H is an evolutionarily conserved component of the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor complex that regulates RNA Polymerase II dependent mRNA processing and transcription elongation. Protein interaction studies showed that SnpL bound to the central Kyprides, Ouzounis, Woese motif region of SUPT5H. Ectopic expression of SnpL led to massive upregulation of host gene expression and macrophage cell death. The activity of SnpL further highlights the ability of L. pneumophila to control fundamental eukaryotic processes such as transcription that, in the case of SnpL, leads to global upregulation of host gene expression.","['Schuelein R', 'Spencer H', 'Dagley LF', 'Li PF', 'Luo L', 'Stow JL', 'Abraham G', 'Naderer T', 'Gomez-Valero L', 'Buchrieser C', 'Sugimoto C', 'Yamagishi J', 'Webb AI', 'Pasricha S', 'Hartland EL']",2018,20,9,Cell Microbiol,"Schuelein R, et al.

29691611,Metagenomic Characterization of Bacterial Communities in Drinking Water Supply System of a Mega City.,"Supplying safe water to consumers is vital for protection of public health. With population of > 15 million, Karachi is the main economical hub of Pakistan. Lake Keenjhar serves as the main source of fresh water while Hub dam is the secondary water reservoir for Karachi. In this study, bacterial community of the drinking water supply system (DWSS) of Karachi was studied from source to tap using metagenomics approach. For this purpose, we collected 41 water samples from different areas of the city (n = 38) and water reservoirs (n = 3). 16S rDNA metagenomic sequencing of water samples revealed that 88% sequences were associated with Proteobacteria (52%), Planctomycetes (15%), Becteroidetes (12%), and Verrucomicrobia (6%). On the class level, α-proteobacteria (6-56%) were found to be the most abundant followed by β- (8-41%) and γ-proteobacteria (6-52%). On the genus level, substantial diversity was observed among the samples. Bacterial communities in water from Hub dam was found to be distantly related while among the residential towns, Lyari was highly distant from the others. Twenty-four bacterial genera were found to be exclusively present in residential area samples in comparison to the source waters which is suggestive of their resistance against treatment procedures and/or contamination. Metagenomic analysis revealed abundance of Pseudomonas, Legionella, Neisseria, Acinetobacter, Bosea, and Microcystis genera in residential areas water samples. The present metagenomic analysis of DWSS of Karachi has allowed the evaluation of bacterial communities in source water and the water being supplied to the city. Moreover, measurement of heavy metals in water samples from Karachi revealed arsenic concentration according to WHO standards which is in contrast of recent study which reported extensive arsenic contamination in aquifers in the Indus valley plain.

29685632,Differential development of Legionella sub-populations during short- and long-term starvation.,"Legionellae are among the most important waterborne pathogens in industrialized countries. Monitoring and surveillance of Legionella in engineered water systems is usually performed with culture-based methods. Since the advent of culture-independent techniques, it has become clear that Legionella concentrations are often several orders of magnitude higher than those measured by culture-based techniques and that a variable proportion of these non-culturable cells are viable. In engineered water systems, the formation of these viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells can be caused by different kinds of stress, such as, and most importantly, nutrient starvation, oxidative stress and heat. In this study, the formation of VBNC cells of six Legionella strains under conditions of starvation was monitored in mono-species microcosms for up to one year using a combination of different viability indicators. Depending on the strain, complete loss of culturability was observed from 11 days to 8 weeks. During the starvation process, three distinct phases and different sub-populations of VBNC cells were identified. Until complete loss of culturability, the number of membrane-intact cells decreased rapidly to 5.5-69% of the initial cell concentration. The concentration of the sub-population with low esterase activity dropped to 0.03-55%, and the concentration of the highly esterase-active sub-population dropped to 0.01-1.2% of the initial concentration; these sub-populations remained stable for several weeks to months. Only after approximately 200 days of starvation, the number of VBNC cells started to decrease below detection limits. The most abundant VBNC sub-populations were characterized by partially damaged membranes and low esterase-activity. With this study, we showed that upon starvation, a stable VBNC Legionella community may be present over several months in a strain-dependent manner even under harsh conditions. Even after one year of starvation, a small proportion of L. pneumophila cells with high esterase-activity was detected. We speculate that this highly active VBNC subpopulation is able to infect amoebae and human macrophages.","['Schrammel B', 'Cervero-Aragó S', 'Dietersdorfer E', 'Walochnik J', 'Lück C', 'Sommer R', 'Kirschner A']",2018,141,,Water Res,"Schrammel B, et al.

29679057,A Legionella pneumophila amylase is essential for intracellular replication in human macrophages and amoebae.,"Legionella pneumophila invades protozoa with an ""accidental"" ability to cause pneumonia upon transmission to humans. To support its nutrition during intracellular residence, L. pneumophila relies on host amino acids as the main source of carbon and energy to feed the TCA cycle. Despite the apparent lack of a requirement for glucose for L. pneumophila growth in vitro and intracellularly, the organism contains multiple amylases, which hydrolyze polysaccharides into glucose monomers. Here we describe one predicted putative amylase, LamB, which is uniquely present only in L. pneumophila and L. steigerwaltii among the ~60 species of Legionella. Our data show that LamB has a strong amylase activity, which is abolished upon substitutions of amino acids that are conserved in the catalytic pocket of amylases. Loss of LamB or expression of catalytically-inactive variants of LamB results in a severe growth defect of L. pneumophila in Acanthamoeba polyphaga and human monocytes-derived macrophages. Importantly, the lamB null mutant is severely attenuated in intra-pulmonary proliferation in the mouse model and is defective in dissemination to the liver and spleen. Our data show an essential role for LamB in intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in amoeba and human macrophages and in virulence in vivo.","['Best A', 'Price C', 'Ozanic M', 'Santic M', 'Jones S', 'Abu Kwaik Y']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,"Best A, et al.

29678761,A recombinase polymerase amplification assay for the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia.,"Pneumonia is one of the most common and potentially lethal infectious conditions worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the pathogen most frequently associated with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, while Legionella pneumophila is the major cause for local outbreaks of legionellosis. Both pathogens can be difficult to diagnose since signs and symptoms are nonspecific and do not differ from other causes of pneumonia. Therefore, a rapid diagnosis within a clinically relevant time is essential for a fast onset of the proper treatment. Although methods based on polymerase chain reaction significantly improved the identification of pathogens, they are difficult to conduct and need specialized equipment. We describe a rapid and sensitive test using isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification and detection on a disposable test strip. This method does not require any special instrumentation and can be performed in less than 20 min. The analytical sensitivity in the multiplex assay amplifying specific regions of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila simultaneously was 10 CFUs of genomic DNA per reaction. In cross detection studies with closely related strains and other bacterial agents the specificity of the RPA was confirmed. The presented method is applicable for near patient and field testing with a rather simple routine and the possibility for a read out with the naked eye.","['Kersting S', 'Rausch V', 'Bier FF', 'von Nickisch-Rosenegk M']",2018,550,,Anal Biochem,"Kersting S, et al.

29674708,Population structure of Environmental and Clinical Legionella pneumophila isolates in Catalonia.,"Legionella is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease (LD). In Spain, Catalonia is the region with the highest incidence of LD cases. The characterisation of clinical and environmental isolates using molecular epidemiology techniques provides epidemiological data for a specific geographic region and makes it possible to carry out phylogenetic and population-based analyses. The aim of this study was to describe and compare environmental and clinical isolates of Legionella pneumophila in Catalonia using sequence-based typing and monoclonal antibody subgrouping. A total of 528 isolates were characterised. For data analysis, the isolates were filtered to reduce redundancies, and 266 isolates (109 clinical and 157 environmental) were finally included. Thirty-two per cent of the clinical isolates were ST23, ST37 and ST1 while 40% of the environmental isolates were ST284 and ST1. Although the index of diversity was higher in clinical than in environmental ST isolates, we observed that clinical STs were similar to those recorded in other regions but that environmental STs were more confined to particular study areas. This observation supports the idea that only certain STs trigger cases or outbreaks in humans. Therefore, comparison of the genomes of clinical and environmental isolates could provide important information about the traits that favour infection or environmental persistence.","['Quero S', 'Párraga-Niño N', 'Barrabeig I', 'Sala MR', 'Pedro-Botet ML', 'Monsó E', 'Jané M', 'Sabrià M', 'Garcia-Núñez M']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,"Quero S, et al.

29649274,Present-day monitoring underestimates the risk of exposure to pathogenic bacteria from cold water storage tanks.,"Water-borne bacteria, found in cold water storage tanks, are causative agents for various human infections and diseases including Legionnaires' disease. Consequently, regular microbiological monitoring of tank water is undertaken as part of the regulatory framework used to control pathogenic bacteria. A key assumption is that a small volume of water taken from under the ball valve (where there is easy access to the stored water) will be representative of the entire tank. To test the reliability of this measure, domestic water samples taken from different locations of selected tanks in London properties between November 2015 and July 2016 were analysed for TVCs, Pseudomonas and Legionella at an accredited laboratory, according to regulatory requirements. Out of ~6000 tanks surveyed, only 15 were selected based on the ability to take a water sample from the normal sampling hatch (located above the ball valve) and from the far end of the tank (usually requiring disassembly of the tank lid with risk of structural damage), and permission being granted by the site manager to undertake the additional investigation and sampling. Despite seasonal differences in water temperature, we found 100% compliance at the ball valve end. In contrast, 40% of the tanks exceeded the regulatory threshold for temperature at the far end of the tank in the summer months. Consequently, 20% of the tanks surveyed failed to trigger appropriate regulatory action based on microbiological analyses of the water sample taken under the ball valve compared to the far end sample using present-day standards. These data show that typical water samples collected for routine monitoring may often underestimate the microbiological status of the water entering the building, thereby increasing the risk of exposure to water bourne pathogens with potential public health implications. We propose that water storage tanks should be redesigned to allow access to the far end of tanks for routine monitoring purposes, and that water samples used to ascertain the regulatory compliance of stored water in tanks should be taken at the point at which water is abstracted for use in the building.","['Peter A', 'Routledge E']",2018,13,4,PLoS One,Peter A and Routledge E.

29644614,Comparison of pathogen-derived 'total risk' with indicator-based correlations for recreational (swimming) exposure.,"Typical recreational water risk to swimmers is assessed using epidemiologically derived correlations by means of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). It has been documented that concentrations of FIB do not necessarily correlate well with protozoa and viral pathogens, which pose an actual threat of illness and thus sometimes may not adequately assess the overall microbial risks from water resources. Many of the known pathogens have dose-response relationships; however, measuring water quality for all possible pathogens is impossible. In consideration of a typical freshwater receiving secondarily treated effluent, we investigated the level of consistency between the indicator-derived correlations and the sum of risks from six reference pathogens using a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) approach. Enterococci and E. coli were selected as the benchmark FIBs, and norovirus, human adenovirus (HAdV), Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp. were selected as the reference pathogens. Microbial decay rates in freshwater and uncertainties in exposure relationships were considered in developing our analysis. Based on our exploratory assessment, the total risk was found within the range of risk estimated by the indicator organisms, with viral pathogens as dominant risk agents, followed by protozoan and bacterial pathogens. The risk evaluated in this study captured the likelihood of gastrointestinal illnesses only, and did not address the overall health risk potential of recreational waters with respect to other disease endpoints. Since other highly infectious pathogens like hepatitis A and Legionella spp. were not included in our analysis, these estimates should be interpreted with caution.","['Sunger N', 'Hamilton KA', 'Morgan PM', 'Haas CN']",2019,26,30,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Sunger N, et al.

29642013,Discovery of Ubiquitin Deamidases in the Pathogenic Arsenal of Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila translocates the largest known arsenal of over 330 pathogenic factors, called ""effectors,"" into host cells during infection, enabling L. pneumophila to establish a replicative niche inside diverse amebas and human macrophages. Here, we reveal that the L. pneumophila effectors MavC (Lpg2147) and MvcA (Lpg2148) are structural homologs of cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) effectors and that the adjacent gene, lpg2149, produces a protein that directly inhibits their activity. In contrast to canonical Cifs, both MavC and MvcA contain an insertion domain and deamidate the residue Gln40 of ubiquitin but not Gln40 of NEDD8. MavC and MvcA are functionally diverse, with only MavC interacting with the human E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2N (Ubc13). MavC deamidates the UBE2N∼Ub conjugate, disrupting Lys63 ubiquitination and dampening NF-κB signaling. Combined, our data reveal a molecular mechanism of host manipulation by pathogenic bacteria and highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms integral to L. pneumophila's pathogenic strategy.","['Valleau D', 'Quaile AT', 'Cui H', 'Xu X', 'Evdokimova E', 'Chang C', 'Cuff ME', 'Urbanus ML', 'Houliston S', 'Arrowsmith CH', 'Ensminger AW', 'Savchenko A']",2018,23,2,Cell Rep,"Valleau D, et al.

29631185,Risk of infection from Legionella associated with spray irrigation of reclaimed water.,"Legionella pneumophila has been detected in reclaimed water used for spray irrigation of turfgrass in public parks and golf courses. This study determined the risks of infection from exposure to various levels of Legionella in reclaimed waters considering: the method of spray application; and the duration and frequency of exposure. Evaluation of these factors resulted in a risk of infection greater than 1:10,000 for several scenarios when the number of Legionella in the reclaimed water exceeded 1000 colony-forming units (CFU) per ml. Most current guidelines for control of Legionella in distribution systems recommend that increased monitoring or remedial action be taken when Legionella levels exceed 1000 to 10,000 CFU/ml. Based upon our risk assessment, these guidelines seem appropriate for reclaimed water systems where spray irrigation is practiced.","['Pepper IL', 'Gerba CP']",2018,139,,Water Res,Pepper IL and Gerba CP.

29625340,"Environmental surveillance and in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents against Legionella pneumophila isolated from hospital water systems in Campania, South Italy: a 5-year study.","BACKGROUND: Legionellosis' treatment failures have been recently reported showing the possibility of resistance development to traditional therapy, especially in healthcare related disease cases. Environmental impact of antibiotic residues, especially in hospital waters, may act on the resistome of Legionella resulting in developing resistance mechanisms.
OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of environmental Legionella pneumophila (Lpn) strains isolated from hospital water systems in Campania, a region located in Southwest Italy.
METHODS: 5321 hospital water samples were investigated for the presence of Lpn. Among positive samples, antibiotic susceptibility was tested for a random subset of 125 Lpn strains (25 Lpn isolates from each of the following serogroups: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8). Susceptibility testing was performed, using the E-test on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar supplemented with α-ketoglutarate, for 10 antimicrobial drugs: azithromycin, cefotaxime, clarithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, rifampicin, tigecycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Non parametric tests were used to determine and assess the significant differences in susceptibility to the different antimicrobics between the serogroups.
RESULTS: Among the isolated strains, none showed resistance to the antibiotics tested. Rifampicin was the most active antibiotic against overall Legionella strains, followed by levofloxacin. Between the macrolides the clarithromycin was overall the most active drug, instead the azithromycin was the less active. Analyzing the different serogroups a significant difference was found between serogroup 1 and non-1 serogroup isolates for doxycycline and tigecycline.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic susceptibility of environmental isolates of Legionella spp. might be useful for the early detection of resistance to antibiotics that directly impacts on mortality and length of hospital stay.","['Torre I', 'Alfano R', 'Borriello T', 'De Giglio O', 'Iervolino C', 'Montagna MT', 'Scamardo MS', 'Pennino F']",2018,164,,Environ Res,"Torre I, et al.

29614246,Recurrent outbreaks caused by the same Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis clone in a German rehabilitation oncology clinic from 2002 to 2009.,"BACKGROUND: Repeated outbreaks of salmonellosis caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis at a rehabilitation clinic in Germany were investigated microbiologically from August 2002 to August 2009.
AIM: To identify the sources of transmission and characterize the S. enterica serovar Infantis isolates.
METHODS: Associated with these outbreaks, isolates from 98 patients, two kitchen staff, five food samples, four swabs of kitchen facilities, three samples of chicken faeces and one sample of sewage water were evaluated by phage typing. All S. enterica serovar Infantis isolates investigated (N=113) were related to phage type (PT) 29. Additionally, 44 of the 113 isolates were selected at random for typing by XbaI macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
FINDINGS: Typing of the 44 isolates showed that the recurrent infections were caused by the single clone PT 29/XB27+44 (42/44, 95.5%). The most likely route of transmission was only identified in the last outbreak in 2009 within the present study. It was found to be cross-contamination in the kitchen facilities (emanating from a contaminated wooden panel), in combination with carriers among the kitchen staff.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated important details of hospital-specific epidemiological processes, and alludes to a long-term reservoir of an epidemic clone of S. enterica serovar Infantis either in a backyard flock of poultry or in an inanimate kitchen reservoir.","['Miller T', 'Brockmann S', 'Spackova M', 'Wetzig J', 'Frank C', 'Pfeifer Y', 'Braun PG', 'Prager R', 'Rabsch W']",2018,100,4,J Hosp Infect,"Miller T, et al.

29611898,Acanthamoeba S13WT relies on its bacterial endosymbiont to backpack human pathogenic bacteria and resist Legionella infection on solid media.,"Soil-borne amoeba Acanthamoeba S13WT has an endosymbiotic relationship with an environmental Neochlamydia bacterial strain. However, regardless of extensive experiments in liquid media, the biological advantage of the symbiosis remained elusive. We therefore explored the role of the endosymbiont in predator-prey interactions on solid media. A mixed culture of the symbiotic or aposymbiotic amoebae and GFP-expressing Escherichia coli or Salmonella Enteritidis was spotted onto the centre of a LB or B-CYE agar plate preinoculated with a ring of mCherry-expressing Legionella pneumophila (Legionella 'wall'). The spread of the amoebae on the plate was assessed using a fluorescence imaging system or scanning electron microscopy. As a result, in contrast to the aposymbiotic amoebae, the symbiotic amoebae backpacked these GFP-expressing bacteria and formed flower-like fluorescence patterns in an anticlockwise direction. Other bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia), but not Staphylococcus aureus, were also backpacked by the symbiotic amoebae on LB agar, although lacked the movement to anticlockwise direction. Furthermore, in contrast to the aposymbiotic amoebae, the symbiotic amoebae backpacking the E. coli broke through the Legionella 'wall' on B-CYE agar plates. Thus, we concluded that Acanthamoeba S13WT required the Neochlamydia endosymbiont to backpack human pathogenic bacteria and resist Legionella infection on solid agar.","['Okubo T', 'Matsushita M', 'Nakamura S', 'Matsuo J', 'Nagai H', 'Yamaguchi H']",2018,10,3,Environ Microbiol Rep,"Okubo T, et al.

29607950,A Novel Diagnostic Scoring System to Differentiate between Legionella pneumophila Pneumonia and Streptococcus pneumoniae Pneumonia.,"Objective We investigated a novel diagnostic scoring system to differentiate Legionella pneumophila pneumonia from Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 62 patients with L. pneumophila pneumonia (L-group) and 70 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia (S-group). Results The serum sodium (Na) levels tended to be lower according to the severity [age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, low blood pressure (A-DROP)] score in the L-group. On a multivariate analysis, we found that four factors were independent predictive markers for inclusion in the L-group: relative bradycardia [hazard ratio (HR) 5.177, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-24.993, p=0.041], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≥292 IU/L (HR 6.804, 95% CI: 1.629-28.416, p=0.009), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels ≥21 mg/dL (HR 28.073, 95% CI: 5.654-139.462, p<0.001), and Na levels ≤137 meq/L (HR 5.828, 95% CI: 1.411-24.065, p=0.015). Furthermore, a total score [ranging from 0 to 4, the sum of the points for each factor (0 or 1)] ≥3 points indicated a higher probability of inclusion in the L-group than in the S-group. The diagnostic accuracy of a total score of 3 had a sensitivity of 36.3%, specificity of 100%, and area under the curve of 0.682 (95% CI: 0.558-0.806, p=0.004), and that of a total score of 4 had a sensitivity 27.4%, specificity of 98.2%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.627 (95% CI: 0.501-0.754, p=0.045).

29566231,Electrophoretic mobility of Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1 to 14.,"Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and can persist within drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) enabling these systems to serve as a potential source of human infections. Bacterial surface charge, deduced from electrophoretic mobility (EPM), is a well-recognized contributor to microorganism mobility, adherence and interactions with their surrounding environment. In this study, the EPM of 32 Lp strains representing serogroup (sg) 1 to 14 were measured, in 9.15 mM KH2PO4 at pH 8, to understand cell surface properties that may influence their occurrence within DWDS. EPM measurements indicated the charge of Lp varied widely between serogroups with five distinct clusters, from least to most negatively charged: (i) sg1 to 3, 5, and 12; (ii) sg6, 8, and 10; (iii) sg9 and 13; (iv) sg7, 11, and 14; and (v) sg4. The EPM of sg1 and 4 strains were pH dependent; however, values were constant between pH 6 and 9, a range typical of drinking water, suggesting that EPM differences between Lp serogroups could impact their survival within DWDS. Understanding the ecological importance of Lp surface properties (e.g. in mobility, colonization, resistance to disinfectants, etc.) within DWDS would aid in mitigation of health risks associated with this water-based pathogen.","['Buse HY', 'Hoelle JM', 'Muhlen C', 'Lytle DA']",2018,365,10,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Buse HY, et al.

29566040,Potential human pathogenic bacteria in five hot springs in Eritrea revealed by next generation sequencing.,"Human pathogens can survive and grow in hot springs. For water quality assessment, Escherichia coli or Enterococci are the main thermotolerant enteric bacteria commonly used to estimate the load of pathogenic bacteria in water. However, most of the environmental bacteria are unculturable thus culture methods may cause bias in detection of most pathogens. Illumina sequencing can provide a more comprehensive and accurate insight into environmental bacterial pathogens, which can be used to develop better risk assessment methods and promote public health awareness. In this study, high-throughput Illumina sequencing was used to identify bacterial pathogens from five hot springs; Maiwooi, Akwar, Garbanabra, Elegedi and Gelti, in Eritrea. Water samples were collected from the five hot springs. Total community DNA was extracted from samples using the phenol-chloroform method. The 16S rRNA gene variable region (V4-V7) of the extracted DNA was amplified and library construction done according to Illumina sequencing protocol. The sequence reads (length >200 bp) from Illumina sequencing libraries ranged from 22,091 sequences in the wet sediment sample from Garbanabra to 155,789 sequences in the mat sample from Elegedi. Taxonomy was assigned to each OTU using BLASTn against a curated database derived from GreenGenes, RDPII, SILVA SSU Reference 119 and NCBI. The proportion of potential pathogens from the water samples was highest in Maiwooi (17.8%), followed by Gelti (16.7%), Akwar (13.6%) and Garbanabra (10.9%). Although the numbers of DNA sequence reads from Illumina sequencing were very high for the Elegedi (104,328), corresponding proportion of potential pathogens very low (3.6%). Most of the potential pathogenic bacterial sequences identified were from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Legionella and Clostridium were the most common detected genera with different species. Most of the potential pathogens were detected from the water samples. However, sequences belonging to Clostridium were observed more abundantly from the mat samples.

While recurrent outbreaks of LD over time linked to an identified single source have been described, multiple unrelated outbreaks clustered in time and geography have not been previously described. We describe unusual geographic and temporal clustering of Legionella outbreaks in two cities, each of which experienced multiple different outbreaks within a small geographic area and within a short timeframe. The explanation for this temporal and spatial clustering of LD outbreaks in two cities is not clear, but climate variation and deteriorating water sanitation are two possible explanations.

29549055,Low genomic diversity of Legionella pneumophila within clinical specimens.,"OBJECTIVES: Legionella pneumophila is the leading cause of Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia acquired from environmental sources. Investigations of both sporadic cases and outbreaks rely mostly on analysis of a single to a few colony pick(s) isolated from each patient. However, because of the lack of data describing diversity within single patients, the optimal number of picks is unknown. Here, we investigated diversity within individual patients using sequence-based typing (SBT) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
METHODS: Ten isolates of L. pneumophila were obtained from each of ten epidemiologically unrelated patients. SBT and WGS were undertaken, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified between isolates from the same patient.
RESULTS: The same sequence type (ST) was obtained for each set of ten isolates. Using genomic analysis, zero SNPs were identified between isolates from seven patients, a maximum of one SNP was found between isolates from two patients, and a maximum of two SNPs was found amongst isolates from one patient. Assuming that the full within-host diversity has been captured with ten isolates, statistical analyses showed that, on average, analysis of one isolate would yield a 70% chance of capturing all observed genotypes, and seven isolates would yield a 90% chance.

29501760,Influence of secondary water supply systems on microbial community structure and opportunistic pathogen gene markers.,"Secondary water supply systems (SWSSs) refer to the in-building infrastructures (e.g., water storage tanks) used to supply water pressure beyond the main distribution systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of SWSSs on microbial community structure and the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens, the latter of which are an emerging public health concern. Higher numbers of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, Legionella and mycobacterial gene markers were found in public building taps served by SWSSs relative to the mains, regardless of the flushing practice (P < 0.05). In residential buildings, genes of L. pneumomhila, Acanthamoeba and Vermamoeba vermiformis were primarily detected in tanks and taps compared to the mains. Long water retention time, warm temperature and loss of disinfectant residuals promoted microbial growth and colonization of potential pathogens in SWSSs. Varied levels of microbial community shifts were found in different types of SWSSs during water transportation from the distribution main to taps, highlighting the critical role of SWSSs in shaping the drinking water microbiota. Overall, the results provided insight to factors that might aid in controlling pathogen proliferation in real-world water systems using SWSSs.","['Li H', 'Li S', 'Tang W', 'Yang Y', 'Zhao J', 'Xia S', 'Zhang W', 'Wang H']",2018,136,,Water Res,"Li H, et al.

29487244,Microbial etiology in hospitalized North Indian adults with community-acquired pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of literature regarding the microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in India. The current study was aimed to study the microbial etiology of hospitalized adults with CAP.
METHODS: The study was conducted in a 700-bedded North Indian hospital. Consecutive adults admitted with CAP over a period of 2 years from 2013 to 2015 were recruited for the study, and apart from clinical evaluation underwent various microbiological studies in the form of blood culture, sputum culture, urinary antigen for pneumococcus and Legionella, serology for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for influenza viruses. Radiographic studies were performed in all patients and repeated as required. The patients were treated with standard antibiotic/antiviral therapy and outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 225 patients (median age: 59 years) were enrolled. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism found (30.5%), followed by Legionella pneumophila (17.5%), influenza viruses (15.4%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (7.2%), Chlamydia pneumonia (5.5%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.1%), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (1.7%), and Acinetobacter sp. (0.8%) with 4% of patients having multiple pathogens etiologies. High Pneumonia Severity Index score correlated with the severity and outcome of the CAP but was not predictive of any definite etiological pathogen. In-hospital mortality was 8%.
CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella, and influenza constitute the most common etiological agents for north Indian adults with CAP requiring hospitalization. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and preventive strategies such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccination need to be considered in appropriate groups.","['Para RA', 'Fomda BA', 'Jan RA', 'Shah S', 'Koul PA']",2018,35,2,Lung India,"Para RA, et al.

29477059,Microbial community characterization of ozone-biofiltration systems in drinking water and potable reuse applications.,"Microbial community structure in the ozone-biofiltration systems of two drinking water and two wastewater treatment facilities was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Collectively, these datasets enabled comparisons by facility, water type (drinking water, wastewater), pre-oxidation (ozonation, chlorination), media type (anthracite, activated carbon), media depth, and backwash dynamics. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in drinking water filters, whereas Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes were differentially abundant in wastewater filters. A positive correlation was observed between media depth and relative abundance of Cyanobacteria in drinking water filters, but there was only a slight increase in one alpha diversity metric with depth in the wastewater filters. Media type had a significant effect on beta but not alpha diversity in drinking water and wastewater filters. Pre-ozonation caused a significant decrease in alpha diversity in the wastewater filters, but the effect on beta diversity was not statistically significant. An evaluation of backwash dynamics resulted in two notable observations: (1) endosymbionts such as Neochlamydia and Legionella increased in relative abundance following backwashing and (2) nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium dominated the microbial community in wastewater filters operated with infrequent backwashing. Bradyrhizobium is known to generate extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which may adversely impact biofilter performance and effluent water quality. These findings have important implications for public health and the operation and resiliency of biofiltration systems.","['Gerrity D', 'Arnold M', 'Dickenson E', 'Moser D', 'Sackett JD', 'Wert EC']",2018,135,,Water Res,"Gerrity D, et al.

Legionella is found as a resident of adherent biofilms in man-made water systems. Disinfection efforts to prevent Legionella infections require a better understanding of the structures that promote Legionella surface attachment and biofilm colonization. Various enzymatic treatments, including multiple carbohydrate-targeting mixtures, failed to disrupt Legionella biofilms, despite the presence of carbohydrates in the biofilms as shown by biochemical methods and concanavalin-A lectin staining. Moreover, Legionella biofilms contained amyloids as detected by three microscopic staining methods (congo red, thioflavin T, and the amyloid-specific antibody WO2). Amyloid structures were seen in biofilms of both L. pneumophila and L. longbeachae, the two Legionella species most associated with human infection. Inhibition of amyloid assembly by congo red and thioflavin T limited both self-aggregation and surface attachment of L. pneumophila, indicating that functional amyloid structures have a key role in initial biofilm formation by these pathogenic bacteria.","['Peterson CP', 'Sauer C', 'Chatfield CH']",2018,75,6,Curr Microbiol,"Peterson CP, et al.

Its effect on the abundance of culturable Legionella and Legionella infections has been documented in several studies. However, the effect of CSI on other bacteria in DWDS is largely unknown. To investigate these effects, we characterized drinking water and biofilm communities in a hospital using CSI, in a neighboring building without CSI, and in treated drinking water at the local water treatment plant. We used 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and Legionella culturing. The sequencing results revealed three distinct water groups: (1) cold-water samples (no CSI), (2) warm-water samples at the research institute (no CSI), and (3) warm-water samples at the hospital (after CSI; ANOSIM, p < 0.001). Differences between the biofilm communities exposed and not exposed to CSI were less clear (ANOSIM, p = 0.022). No Legionella were cultured, but limited numbers of Legionella sequences were recovered from all 25 water samples (0.2-1.4% relative abundance). The clustering pattern indicated local selection of Legionella types (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001). Furthermore, one unclassified Betaproteobacteria OTU was highly enriched in CSI-treated warm water samples at the hospital (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001).","['Stüken A', 'Haverkamp THA', 'Dirven HAAM', 'Gilfillan GD', 'Leithaug M', 'Lund V']",2018,52,6,Environ Sci Technol,"Stüken A, et al.

29460533,Colonization of Legionella spp. In dental unit waterlines.,"Legionella spp. are ubiquitous in aquatic habitats and water distribution systems, including dental unit waterlines. Surveys have shown that the percentage of samples taken at different dental sites that were positive for Legionella spp. were highly variable and ranged from 0% to 100%. Cultivation is the principal approach to evaluating bacterial contamination employed in the past, but applying this approach to testing for Legionella spp. may result in false-negative data or underestimated bacterial counts. PCR and direct fluorescent counts can detect viable non-cultivable bacteria, which are not counted by plating procedures. Legionella spp., commonly form such viable non-culturable cells and it is likely that they contribute to the difference between plate count results and those of PCR and fluorescent-antibody detection. However, studies have shown that Legionella is present in the municipal water source in spite of the current filtration and chlorination procedures. Once Legionella reaches the building water system, it settles down into a biofilm layer of stagnant water. By means of this layer, Legionella can protect itself from antimicrobial agents and then multiply. Dental unit waterlines may be contaminated with opportunistic bacteria. The water quality in the dental units should be controlled to eliminate opportunistic pathogens and to provide water for dental treatment that meets public health standards for potable water.","['Carinci F', 'Scapoli L', 'Contaldo M', 'Santoro R', 'Palmieri A', 'Pezzetti F', 'Lauritano D', 'Candotto V', 'Mucchi D', 'Baggi L', 'Tagliabue A', 'Tettamanti L']",2018,32,2 Suppl. 1,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,"Carinci F, et al.

Legionella proliferation in cooling tower water has serious public health implications as it can be transmitted to humans via aerosols and cause Legionnaires' disease.
METHODS: Samples of cooling tower water were collected from King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) (Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, 2015/2016). The water samples were analyzed by a standard Legionella culture method, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing. In addition, the bacterial community composition was evaluated.
RESULTS: All samples were negative by conventional Legionella culture. In contrast, all water samples yielded positive results by real-time PCR (105 to 106 GU/L). The results of 16S rRNA next generation sequencing showed high similarity and reproducibility among the water samples. The majority of sequences were Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-proteobacteria, and Legionella was the predominant genus. The hydrogen-oxidizing gram-negative bacterium Hydrogenophaga was present at high abundance, indicating high metabolic activity. Sphingopyxis, which is known for its resistance to antimicrobials and as a pioneer in biofilm formation, was also detected.

29432149,"Assessment of the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Flint, Michigan.","The 2014-2015 Legionnaires' disease (LD) outbreak in Genesee County, MI, and the outbreak resolution in 2016 coincided with changes in the source of drinking water to Flint's municipal water system. Following the switch in water supply from Detroit to Flint River water, the odds of a Flint resident presenting with LD increased 6.3-fold (95% CI: 2.5, 14.0). This risk subsided following boil water advisories, likely due to residents avoiding water, and returned to historically normal levels with the switch back in water supply. During the crisis, as the concentration of free chlorine in water delivered to Flint residents decreased, their risk of acquiring LD increased. When the average weekly chlorine level in a census tract was <0.5 mg/L or <0.2 mg/L, the odds of an LD case presenting from a Flint neighborhood increased by a factor of 2.9 (95% CI: 1.4, 6.3) or 3.9 (95% CI: 1.8, 8.7), respectively. During the switch, the risk of a Flint neighborhood having a case of LD increased by 80% per 1 mg/L decrease in free chlorine, as calculated from the extensive variation in chlorine observed. In communities adjacent to Flint, the probability of LD occurring increased with the flow of commuters into Flint.

Moreover, toxic Shiga strains of bacteria E. coli can cause life-threatening hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Because of the recent restrictions imposed on the usage of chlorine, outbreaks of these two bacterial species have become more common. In this study we have developed a novel rotation generator and its effectiveness against bacteria Legionella pneumophila and Escherichia coli was tested for various types of hydrodynamic cavitation (attached steady cavitation, developed unsteady cavitation and supercavitation). The results show that the supercavitation was the only effective form of cavitation. It enabled more than 3 logs reductions for both bacterial species and was also effective against a more persistent Gram positive bacteria, B. subtilis. The deactivation mechanism is at present unknown. It is proposed that when bacterial cells enter a supercavitation cavity, an immediate pressure drop occurs and this results in bursting of the cellular membrane. The new rotation generator that induced supercavitation proved to be economically and microbiologically far more effective than the classical Venturi section (super)cavitation.","['Šarc A', 'Kosel J', 'Stopar D', 'Oder M', 'Dular M']",2018,42,,Ultrason Sonochem,"Šarc A, et al.

29427765,Comparative genome analysis reveals a complex population structure of Legionella pneumophila subspecies.,"The majority of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases are caused by Legionella pneumophila, a genetically heterogeneous species composed of at least 17 serogroups. Previously, it was demonstrated that L. pneumophila consists of three subspecies: pneumophila, fraseri and pascullei. During an LD outbreak investigation in 2012, we detected that representatives of both subspecies fraseri and pascullei colonized the same water system and that the outbreak-causing strain was a new member of the least represented subspecies pascullei. We used partial sequence based typing consensus patterns to mine an international database for additional representatives of fraseri and pascullei subspecies. As a result, we identified 46 sequence types (STs) belonging to subspecies fraseri and two STs belonging to subspecies pascullei. Moreover, a recent retrospective whole genome sequencing analysis of isolates from New York State LD clusters revealed the presence of a fourth L. pneumophila subspecies that we have termed raphaeli. This subspecies consists of 15 STs. Comparative analysis was conducted using the genomes of multiple members of all four L. pneumophila subspecies. Whereas each subspecies forms a distinct phylogenetic clade within the L. pneumophila species, they share more average nucleotide identity with each other than with other Legionella species. Unique genes for each subspecies were identified and could be used for rapid subspecies detection. Improved taxonomic classification of L. pneumophila strains may help identify environmental niches and virulence attributes associated with these genetically distinct subspecies.","['Kozak-Muiznieks NA', 'Morrison SS', 'Mercante JW', 'Ishaq MK', 'Johnson T', 'Caravas J', 'Lucas CE', 'Brown E', 'Raphael BH', 'Winchell JM']",2018,59,,Infect Genet Evol,"Kozak-Muiznieks NA, et al.

In addition, we used a second plumbing rig to represent a well-managed system at 60 °C and conducted a ""control"" sampling at 60 °C, subsequently reducing the temperature to 40 °C to observe the effects on Legionella and the microbiota under a simulated ""thermal disruption"" scenario.
RESULTS: According to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, in the heat shock scenario, there was no significant difference or statistically significant, but small, difference in the microbial community composition at the distal taps pre- versus post-heat shock (both biofilm and water; weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices). While heat shock did lead to decreased total bacteria numbers at distal taps, it did not measurably alter the richness or evenness of the microbiota. Quantitative PCR measurements demonstrated that L. pneumophila relative abundance at distal taps also was not significantly different at 2-month post-heat shock relative to the pre-heat shock condition, while relative abundance of Vermamoeba vermiformis, a known Legionella host, did increase. In the thermal disruption scenario, relative abundance of planktonic L. pneumophila (quantitative PCR data) increased to levels comparable to those observed in the heat shock scenario within 2 months of switching long-term operation at 60 to 40 °C. Overall, water use frequency and water heater temperature set point exhibited a stronger effect than one-time heat shock on the microbial composition and Legionella levels at distal taps.
CONCLUSIONS: While heat shock may be effective for instantaneous Legionella control and reduction in total bacteria numbers, water heater temperature set point and water use frequency are more promising factors for long-term Legionella and microbial community control, illustrating the importance of maintaining consistent elevated temperatures in the system relative to short-term heat shock.","['Ji P', 'Rhoads WJ', 'Edwards MA', 'Pruden A']",2018,6,1,Microbiome,"Ji P, et al.

To facilitate host cell subversion, bacterial pathogens use specialized secretion systems to deliver bacterial virulence factors, termed effectors, into the host cell that mimic, agonize, and/or antagonize the function of host proteins.

29415051,RavN is a member of a previously unrecognized group of Legionella pneumophila E3 ubiquitin ligases.,"The eukaryotic ubiquitylation machinery catalyzes the covalent attachment of the small protein modifier ubiquitin to cellular target proteins in order to alter their fate. Microbial pathogens exploit this post-translational modification process by encoding molecular mimics of E3 ubiquitin ligases, eukaryotic enzymes that catalyze the final step in the ubiquitylation cascade. Here, we show that the Legionella pneumophila effector protein RavN belongs to a growing class of bacterial proteins that mimic host cell E3 ligases to exploit the ubiquitylation pathway. The E3 ligase activity of RavN was located within its N-terminal region and was dependent upon interaction with a defined subset of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The crystal structure of the N-terminal region of RavN revealed a U-box-like motif that was only remotely similar to other U-box domains, indicating that RavN is an E3 ligase relic that has undergone significant evolutionary alteration. Substitution of residues within the predicted E2 binding interface rendered RavN inactive, indicating that, despite significant structural changes, the mode of E2 recognition has remained conserved. Using hidden Markov model-based secondary structure analyses, we identified and experimentally validated four additional L. pneumophila effectors that were not previously recognized to possess E3 ligase activity, including Lpg2452/SdcB, a new paralog of SidC. Our study provides strong evidence that L. pneumophila is dedicating a considerable fraction of its effector arsenal to the manipulation of the host ubiquitylation pathway.","['Lin YH', 'Lucas M', 'Evans TR', 'Abascal-Palacios G', 'Doms AG', 'Beauchene NA', 'Rojas AL', 'Hierro A', 'Machner MP']",2018,14,2,PLoS Pathog,"Lin YH, et al.

These organisms are ubiquitous in nature and have been isolated from diverse ecological environments, including man-made structures such as cooling towers and spas. Legionellae have also been isolated from human and veterinary clinical specimens, and their roles in disease are well-established. This report describes the isolation of a novel Legionella species from a respiratory specimen from a patient with influenza and suspected pulmonary embolus.
CASE: A 68-year-old male presented to an Indianapolis-area hospital with pulmonary disease; upon workup, he was found to have influenza A. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was also submitted for conventional bacterial culture and Legionella culture. The patient was prescribed a broad-spectrum antibiotic and recovered.
RESULTS: A Legionella-like bacterium was isolated on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, and mass spectrometry and comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing inconclusively identified the isolate as a Legionella sp. Further analysis of the 16S rRNA gene confirmed the strain to be a new species, related to Legionella hackeliae.

29409685,Starved viable but non-culturable (VBNC) Legionella strains can infect and replicate in amoebae and human macrophages.,"Legionella infections are among the most important waterborne infections with constantly increasing numbers of cases in industrialized countries, as a result of aging populations, rising numbers of immunocompromised individuals and increased need for conditioned water due to climate change. Surveillance of water systems is based on microbiological culture-based techniques; however, it has been shown that high percentages of the Legionella populations in water systems are not culturable. In the past two decades, the relevance of such viable but non-culturable (VBNC) legionellae has been controversially discussed, and whether VBNC legionellae can directly infect human macrophages, the primary targets of Legionella infections, remains unclear. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that several starved VBNC Legionella strains (four L. pneumophila serogroup 1 strains, a serogroup 6 strain and a L. micdadei strain) can directly infect different types of human macrophages and amoebae even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water. However, under these conditions, the strains caused infection with reduced efficacy, as represented by the lower percentages of infected cells, prolonged time in co-culture and higher multiplicities of infection required. Interestingly, the VBNC cells remained mostly non-culturable even after multiplication within the host cells. Amoebal infection by starved VBNC Legionella, which likely occurs in oligotrophic biofilms, would result in an increase in the bacterial concentration in drinking-water systems. If cells remain in the VBNC state, the real number of active legionellae will be underestimated by the use of culture-based standard techniques. Thus, further quantitative research is needed in order to determine, whether and how many starved VBNC Legionella cells are able to cause disease in humans.","['Dietersdorfer E', 'Kirschner A', 'Schrammel B', 'Ohradanova-Repic A', 'Stockinger H', 'Sommer R', 'Walochnik J', 'Cervero-Aragó S']",2018,141,,Water Res,"Dietersdorfer E, et al.

We also sought to determine whether time required to obtain culture results can be reduced compared to spread-plate culture method. We also assessed whether polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in-field total heterotrophic aerobic bacteria (THAB) counts are reliable indicators of Legionella in water samples from buildings. DESIGN Comparative Legionella screening and diagnostics study for environmental validation of a healthcare building water system. SETTING Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facility water system in central Texas. METHODS We analyzed 50 water samples (26 hot, 24 cold) from 40 sinks and 10 showers using spread-plate cultures (International Standards Organization [ISO] 11731) on samples shipped overnight to the analytical lab. In-field, on-site cultures were obtained using the PVT (Phigenics Validation Test) culture dipslide-format sampler. A PCR assay for genus-level Legionella was performed on every sample. RESULTS No practical differences regardless of sample volume filtered were observed. Larger sample volumes yielded more detections of Legionella. No statistically significant differences at the 1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL or 10 CFU/mL LOD were observed. Approximately 75% less time was required when cultures were started in the field. The PCR results provided an early warning, which was confirmed by spread-plate cultures. The THAB results did not correlate with Legionella status.

29395563,[Bacteriology of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Tunisia].,"INTRODUCTION: The role of bacteria, including atypical organisms, in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) has been assessed in various ways in Tunisia.
METHODS: This was a descriptive and analytical study of patients with a mean age of 68.3±10.5 years hospitalized for AECOPD. Bacteriological examination included a cytological sputum exam and serology for atypical organisms including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila using standard techniques.
RESULTS: Of the 240 patients enrolled, 175 sputum cultures (73%) were considered significant. Twenty-nine cultures were positive (16.5%) and 31 microorganisms were isolated of which the most frequent were P. aeruginosa (25.8%), K. pneumoniae (16.2%), H. influenzae (13%) and S. pneumoniae (9.7%). The prevalence of C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae and C. burnetii was 8.4%, 9% and 6.6%, respectively. No L. pneumophila infection was found. The Anthonisen criteria were associated with a positive culture (P=0.04). Almost half (40.9%) of the isolates were resistant to conventional first line antibiotics (43.7% to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid).

29366468,Evaluation of WGS based approaches for investigating a food-borne outbreak caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Derby in Germany.,"In Germany salmonellosis still represents the 2nd most common bacterial foodborne disease. The majority of infections are caused by Salmonella (S.) Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis followed by a variety of other broad host-range serovars. Salmonella Derby is one of the five top-ranked serovars isolated from humans and it represents one of the most prevalent serovars in pigs, thus bearing the potential risk for transmission to humans upon consumption of pig meat and products thereof. From November 2013 to January 2014 S. Derby caused a large outbreak that affected 145 primarily elderly people. Epidemiological investigations identified raw pork sausage as the probable source of infection, which was confirmed by microbiological evidence. During the outbreak isolates from patients, food specimen and asymptomatic carriers were investigated by conventional typing methods. However, the quantity and quality of available microbiological and epidemiological data made this outbreak highly suitable for retrospective investigation by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and subsequent evaluation of different bioinformatics approaches for cluster definition. Overall the WGS-based methods confirmed the results of the conventional typing but were of significant higher discriminatory power. That was particularly beneficial for strains with incomplete epidemiological data. For our data set both, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)- and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST)-based methods proved to be appropriate tools for cluster definition.","['Simon S', 'Trost E', 'Bender J', 'Fuchs S', 'Malorny B', 'Rabsch W', 'Prager R', 'Tietze E', 'Flieger A']",2018,71,,Food Microbiol,"Simon S, et al.

29317310,Amoebal endosymbiont Neochlamydia protects host amoebae against Legionella pneumophila infection by preventing Legionella entry.,"Acanthamoeba isolated from environmental soil harbors the obligate intracellular symbiont Neochlamydia, which has a critical role in host amoebal defense against Legionella pneumophila infection. Here, by using morphological analysis with confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, proteome analyses with two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and transcriptome analysis with DNA microarray, we explored the mechanism by which the Neochlamydia affected this defense. We observed that when rare uptake did occur, the symbiotic amoebae allowed Legionella to grow normally. However, the symbiotic amoebae had severely reduced uptake of Legionella when compared with the aposymbiotic amoebae. Also, in contrast to amoebae carrying the endosymbiont, the actin cytoskeleton was significantly disrupted by Legionella infection in aposymbiotic amoebae. Furthermore, despite Legionella exposure, there was little change in Neochlamydia gene expression. Taken together, we concluded that the endosymbiont, Neochlamydia prevents Legionella entry to the host amoeba, resulting in the host defense against Legionella infection.","['Maita C', 'Matsushita M', 'Miyoshi M', 'Okubo T', 'Nakamura S', 'Matsuo J', 'Takemura M', 'Miyake M', 'Nagai H', 'Yamaguchi H']",2018,20,4,Microbes Infect,"Maita C, et al.

On the other hand, some bacteria may be human pathogens and pose a threat to consumers. The present study investigated bacterial communities using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and their functions were predicted using PICRUSt in a treatment system, including the biofilms on sand filters and biological activated carbon (BAC) filters, in 4 months. In addition, quantitative analyses of specific bacterial populations were performed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The bacterial community composition of post-ozonation effluent, BAC effluent and disinfected water varied with sampling time. However, the bacterial community structures at other treatment steps were relatively stable, despite great variations of source water quality, resulting in stable treatment performance.

29304227,Combining Environmental Investigation and a Dual-Analytical Strategy to Isolate the Legionella longbeachae Strain Linked to Two Occupational Cases of Legionellosis.,"Legionella has a global distribution, mainly in aquatic and man-made environments. Under the right conditions, this bacterium is a notorious human pathogen responsible for severe pulmonary illnesses. Legionellosis outbreaks are reported around the world, and exposure to water droplet aerosols containing Legionella pneumophila is usually the mechanism of its transmission. Even if L. pneumophila causes most outbreaks, Legionella longbeachae also accounts for some cases. Unlike most other Legionella strains, L. longbeachae is typically found in soil. Given the wide diversity and high concentration of microorganisms found in soil, isolating L. longbeachae by culture can be challenging. Because the chances of successfully isolating the strain are low, it is often not even attempted. This study reports the strategies used to successfully isolate L. longbeachae strain that was responsible of the two occupational legionellosis in Quebec. Fifteen random samples were collected from the soil of the metal recycling plant where the diagnosed workers were employed, covering 1.5% of the accessible surface of the plant. All samples were analyzed with both the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and culture methods. Four qPCR detection systems targeting Legionella spp, L. pneumophila, L. pneumophila serogroup 1, and L. longbeachae were used. Acid, heat, and acid/heat treatments were used for the culture method. For the qPCR method, all samples were positives for Legionella spp but only four were positives for L. longbeachae. For the culture method, only one isolate could be confirmed to be L. longbeachae. However, that strain proves to be the same one that caused the occupational legionellosis. Detecting the presence of L. longbeachae using the qPCR method made it possible to target the right samples to enable the cultivable strain of L. longbeachae to be isolated from the soil of the metal recycling plant. The complementarity of the two methods was established. This paper demonstrated the advantages of selecting the proper sampling and analytical strategies to achieve the isolation of the strain responsible for the infections. It also highlights for the first time in Quebec the potential occupational risks associated with L. longbeachae from soil and should motivate questioning soil exposures when all sources of water contamination have been eliminated from the causal analysis of legionellosis.","['Marchand G', 'Lord J', 'Pépin C', 'Lacombe N']",2018,62,3,Ann Work Expo Health,"Marchand G, et al.

29299927,Biofilms in Full-Scale Drinking Water Ozone Contactors Contribute Viable Bacteria to Ozonated Water.,"Concentrations of viable microbial cells were monitored using culture-based and culture-independent methods across multichamber ozone contactors in a full-scale drinking water treatment plant. Membrane-intact and culturable cell concentrations in ozone contactor effluents ranged from 1200 to 3750 cells/mL and from 200 to 3850 colony forming units/mL, respectively. Viable cell concentrations decreased significantly in the first ozone contact chamber, but rose, even as ozone exposure increased, in subsequent chambers. Our results implicate microbial detachment from biofilms on contactor surfaces, and from biomass present within lime softening sediments in a hydraulic dead zone, as a possible reason for increasing cell concentrations in water samples from sequential ozone chambers. Biofilm community structures on baffle walls upstream and downstream from the dead zone were significantly different from each other ( p = 0.017). The biofilms downstream of the dead zone contained a significantly ( p = 0.036) higher relative abundance of bacteria of the genera Mycobacterium and Legionella than the upstream biofilms. These results have important implications as the effluent from ozone contactors is often treated further in biologically active filters and bacteria in ozonated water continuously seed filter microbial communities.","['Kotlarz N', 'Rockey N', 'Olson TM', 'Haig SJ', 'Sanford L', 'LiPuma JJ', 'Raskin L']",2018,52,5,Environ Sci Technol,"Kotlarz N, et al.

29298342,The common HAQ STING variant impairs cGAS-dependent antibacterial responses and is associated with susceptibility to Legionnaires' disease in humans.,"UNLABELLED: The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway is central for innate immune sensing of various bacterial, viral and protozoal infections. Recent studies identified the common HAQ and R232H alleles of TMEM173/STING, but the functional consequences of these variants for primary infections are unknown. Here we demonstrate that cGAS- and STING-deficient murine macrophages as well as human cells of individuals carrying HAQ TMEM173/STING were severely impaired in producing type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to Legionella pneumophila, bacterial DNA or cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). In contrast, R232H attenuated cytokine production only following stimulation with bacterial CDN, but not in response to L. pneumophila or DNA. In a mouse model of Legionnaires' disease, cGAS- and STING-deficient animals exhibited higher bacterial loads as compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, the haplotype frequency of HAQ TMEM173/STING, but not of R232H TMEM173/STING, was increased in two independent cohorts of human Legionnaires' disease patients as compared to healthy controls. Our study reveals that the cGAS-STING cascade contributes to antibacterial defense against L. pneumophila in mice and men, and provides important insight into how the common HAQ TMEM173/STING variant affects antimicrobial immune responses and susceptibility to infection.

However, the factors triggering its growth are not yet well understood. This knowledge is needed to develop strategies to minimize the risk of the spread of Legionnaires' disease that originates in these systems. In the present study, L. pneumophila multiplied exponentially at 35 °C in activated sludge, but lower temperatures (24 °C and 15 °C) did not favour the growth of the pathogen despite the presence of its protozoan hosts (free-living amoeba and ciliates). L. non-pneumophila species, which are adapted to low temperature, prevailed at 15 °C. Legionella was found dispersed in the activated sludge, forming clusters of different sizes and also inside protozoa. This study shows that temperature is a key parameter triggering the growth of L. pneumophila in activated sludge. The detection of infected protozoa suggests that these are important vehicles for the multiplication of Legionella. However, in this study it was not possible to exclude the growth of Legionella directly on the substrate or on the activated sludge matrix.","['Caicedo C', 'Rosenwinkel KH', 'Nogueira R']",2018,221,2,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Caicedo C, et al.

29261791,Distribution of Legionella and bacterial community composition among regionally diverse US cooling towers.,"Cooling towers (CTs) are a leading source of outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease (LD), a severe form of pneumonia caused by inhalation of aerosols containing Legionella bacteria. Accordingly, proper maintenance of CTs is vital for the prevention of LD. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of Legionella in a subset of regionally diverse US CTs and characterize the associated microbial communities. Between July and September of 2016, we obtained aliquots from water samples collected for routine Legionella testing from 196 CTs located in eight of the nine continental US climate regions. After screening for Legionella by PCR, positive samples were cultured and the resulting Legionella isolates were further characterized. Overall, 84% (164) were PCR-positive, including samples from every region studied. Of the PCR-positive samples, Legionella spp were isolated from 47% (78), L. pneumophila was isolated from 32% (53), and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) was isolated from 24% (40). Overall, 144 unique Legionella isolates were identified; 53% (76) of these were Legionella pneumophila. Of the 76 L. pneumophila isolates, 51% (39) were Lp1. Legionella were isolated from CTs in seven of the eight US regions examined. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to compare the bacterial communities of CT waters with and without detectable Legionella as well as the microbiomes of waters from different climate regions. Interestingly, the microbial communities were homogenous across climate regions. When a subset of seven CTs sampled in April and July were compared, there was no association with changes in corresponding CT microbiomes over time in the samples that became culture-positive for Legionella. Legionella species and Lp1 were detected frequently among the samples examined in this first large-scale study of Legionella in US CTs. Our findings highlight that, under the right conditions, there is the potential for CT-related LD outbreaks to occur throughout the US.","['Llewellyn AC', 'Lucas CE', 'Roberts SE', 'Brown EW', 'Nayak BS', 'Raphael BH', 'Winchell JM']",2017,12,12,PLoS One,"Llewellyn AC, et al.

Furthermore, we compared the clinical characteristics and six-point scores between non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients among hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia patients enrolled prospectively between October 2010 and July 2016.
RESULTS: Eleven patients had pneumonia due to non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1; their median age was 66 years and 8 patients (72.7%) were male. The most common pathogen was L. pneumophila serogroup 3 (6/11), followed by L. pneumophila serogroup 9 (3/11), L. pneumophila serogroup 6 (1/11) and L. longbeachae (1/11). Non-specific symptoms, such as fever and cough, were common. Six patients (54.5%) had liver enzyme elevation, but no patient developed hyponatraemia at <130 mEq/L. Nine patients (81.8%) showed lobar pneumonia and 7 patients (63.6%) manifested with consolidation and ground-glass opacity. Patients with mild to moderate severity comprised 10 (90.9%) by CURB-65 and 5 (45.5%) by the Pneumonia Severity Index. Of all patients, 4 were admitted to the intensive care unit and 3 died despite appropriate empiric therapy. The clinical characteristics were not significantly different between non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients (n = 23). At a cut-off value of ≥ 2 points, the sensitivity of the six-point scoring system was 54.5% (6/11) for non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients and 95.7% (22/23) for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Cases of non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 pneumonia varied in severity from mild to severe and the clinical characteristics were often non-specific. The six-point scoring system was not useful in predicting such Legionella pneumonia cases.","['Ito A', 'Ishida T', 'Washio Y', 'Yamazaki A', 'Tachibana H']",2017,17,1,BMC Pulm Med,"Ito A, et al.

A chest x-ray showed extensive bilateral infiltrates, and she was quickly intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. A urine legionella antigen test was positive, and she was admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of severe legionella pneumonia. She improved over the next week with a course of levofloxacin. Once improved, the state health department visited her home and interviewed her husband and determined that she had not been cleaning her continuous positive pressure mask, tubing and humidifier appropriately. They concluded that the legionella likely came from her continuous positive airway pressure equipment. Cases of legionella pneumonia have frequently been reported through infected water supplies and even respiratory equipment. It is crucial that the mask and tubing used with these devices are cleaned appropriately to minimize the risk of infection.","['Schnirman R', 'Nur N', 'Bonitati A', 'Carino G']",2017,5,,SAGE Open Med Case Rep,"Schnirman R, et al.

29235173,Type IV secretion in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.,"Type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are versatile multiprotein nanomachines spanning the entire cell envelope in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. They play important roles through the contact-dependent secretion of effector molecules into eukaryotic hosts and conjugative transfer of mobile DNA elements as well as contact-independent exchange of DNA with the extracellular milieu. In the last few years, many details on the molecular mechanisms of T4SSs have been elucidated. Exciting structures of T4SS complexes from Escherichia coli plasmids R388 and pKM101, Helicobacter pylori and Legionella pneumophila have been solved. The structure of the F-pilus was also reported and surprisingly revealed a filament composed of pilin subunits in 1:1 stoichiometry with phospholipid molecules. Many new T4SSs have been identified and characterized, underscoring the structural and functional diversity of this secretion superfamily. Complex regulatory circuits also have been shown to control T4SS machine production in response to host cell physiological status or a quorum of bacterial recipient cells in the vicinity. Here, we summarize recent advances in our knowledge of 'paradigmatic' and emerging systems, and further explore how new basic insights are aiding in the design of strategies aimed at suppressing T4SS functions in bacterial infections and spread of antimicrobial resistances.","['Grohmann E', 'Christie PJ', 'Waksman G', 'Backert S']",2018,107,4,Mol Microbiol,"Grohmann E, et al.

Free-living amoebae (FLA) can serve as natural hosts and thus as reservoirs of many amoebae-resistant bacteria. An encysted amoeba can contribute to the resistance of intracellular L. pneumophila to various chemical and physical treatments. Humans can be infected by droplets containing bacteria from an environmental source or human-made devices such as shower heads, bathtubs, air-conditioning units or whirlpools. In this study, we were investigating the presence of FLA and L. pneumophila in plumbing systems of healthcare facilities in Bratislava (Slovakia) by standard diagnostic methods, while the presence of L. pneumophila was verified also by MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) analysis. The results showed the occurrence of L. pneumophila and FLA in 62.26% and 66.4% of samples taken from four paediatric clinics, respectively. Both standard methods and MALDI-TOF MS showed comparable results and they can be successfully applied for the identification of L. pneumophila strains in environmental samples.

Nowadays, there are commercial antibodies against this bacterium, but they have not been tested against all subgroups of L. pneumophila sg 1 or serogroups 1-16 or their cross-reactions with other non-Legionella bacteria. Indeed, many of these antibodies became available when only 8 serogroups of L. pneumophila had been described. We tested 7 antibodies and found that 2 (Mab 8/5 and OBT) specifically detected all the subgroups of L. pneumophila sg 1, one without cross-reactions (Mab8/5). Moreover, the LP3IIG2 antibody detected almost all serogroups tested with lower rates of cross-reactivity, resulting in a specific sensitive antibody for the detection of L. pneumophila. LP3IIG2 presented higher rate of cross-reactivity against respiratory non-Legionella isolates, thereby contraindicating its clinical applicability.","['Párraga-Niño N', 'Quero S', 'Uria N', 'Castillo-Fernandez O', 'Jimenez-Ezenarro J', 'Muñoz FX', 'Sabrià M', 'Garcia-Nuñez M']",2018,90,2,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"Párraga-Niño N, et al.

A general strategy is presented to prepare ADPr peptide analogues based on a copper-catalyzed click reaction between an azide-modified peptide and an alkyne-modified ADPr counterpart. The scope of this approach was expanded to proteins by preparing two ubiquitin ADPr analogues carrying the biological relevant α-glycosidic linkage. Biochemical validation using Legionella effector enzyme SdeA shows that clicked ubiquitin ADPr is well-tolerated and highlights the potential of this strategy to prepare ADPr proteins.,"['Liu Q', 'Kistemaker HAV', 'Bhogaraju S', 'Dikic I', 'Overkleeft HS', 'van der Marel GA', 'Ovaa H', 'van der Heden van Noort GJ', 'Filippov DV']",2018,57,6,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,"Liu Q, et al.

29215169,Stimulation of PgdA-dependent peptidoglycan N-deacetylation by GpsB-PBP A1 in Listeria monocytogenes.,"Listeria monocytogenes and other pathogenic bacteria modify their peptidoglycan to protect it against enzymatic attack through the host innate immune system, such as the cell wall hydrolase lysozyme. During our studies on GpsB, a late cell division protein that controls activity of the bi-functional penicillin binding protein PBP A1, we discovered that GpsB influences lysozyme resistance of L. monocytogenes as mutant strains lacking gpsB showed an increased lysozyme resistance. Deletion of pbpA1 corrected this effect, demonstrating that PBP A1 is also involved in this. Susceptibility to lysozyme mainly depends on two peptidoglycan modifying enzymes: The peptidoglycan N-deacetylase PgdA and the peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase OatA. Genetic and biochemical experiments consistently demonstrated that the increased lysozyme resistance of the ΔgpsB mutant was PgdA-dependent and OatA-independent. Protein-protein interaction studies supported the idea that GpsB, PBP A1 and PgdA form a complex in L. monocytogenes and identified the regions in PBP A1 and PgdA required for complex formation. These results establish a physiological connection between GpsB, PBP A1 and the peptidoglycan modifying enzyme PgdA. To our knowledge, this is the first reported link between a GpsB-like cell division protein and factors important for escape from the host immune system.","['Rismondo J', 'Wamp S', 'Aldridge C', 'Vollmer W', 'Halbedel S']",2018,107,4,Mol Microbiol,"Rismondo J, et al.

29215132,May car washing represent a risk for Legionella infection?,"BACKGROUND: Legionella is a ubiquitous Gram-negative bacterium naturally found in aquatic environments. It can pose a health problem when it grows and spreads in man-made water systems. Legionella pneumophila is the most common cause of Legionnaires' disease nowadays, a community-acquired pneumonia with pulmonary symptoms and chest radiography no different from any other form of infectious pneumonia. Legionella monitoring is important for public health reasons, including the identification of unusual environmental sources of Legionella.
METHODS: We report two cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with two different car wash installations in the province of Vicenza, in the Veneto region, northeastern Italy. Patients were not employees of the car wash installations, but users of the service. In both cases, Legionella antigen was detected in urine using the Alere BinaxNOW® Legionella Urinary Antigen, and Legionella antibodies were detected in serum using SERION ELISA classic Legionella pneumophila 1-7 IgG and IgM. Water samples were also analyzed as part of the surveillance program for Legionella prevention and control in compliance with the Italian guidelines.
RESULTS: Both patients had clinical symptoms and chest radiography compatible with pneumonia, and only one of them had diabetes as a risk factor. Legionella urinary antigen and serological test on serum samples were positive for Legionella in both patients, even if much slighter in the case A due to the retrospective serological investigation performed a year later the episode and after the second clinical case occurred in the same district. The environmental investigations highlighted two different car wash plants as potential source of infection. A certified company using shock hyperchlorination was asked to disinfect the two plants and, subsequently, control samples resulted negative for Legionella pneumophila.
CONCLUSION: Any water source producing aerosols should be considered at risk for the transmission of Legionella bacteria, including car wash installations frequently used by a large number of customers and where poor maintenance probably creates favorable conditions for Legionella overgrowth and spreading. Additional research is needed to ascertain optimal strategies for Legionella monitoring and control, but environmental surveillance, paying careful attention to possible unconventional sources, should remain an important component of any Legionnaires' disease prevention program. Additionally, all available diagnostic methods would be recommended for the confirmation of all cases even in the event of non-serogroup 1 Legionella pneumophila infection, probably underestimated at this time.","['Baldovin T', 'Pierobon A', 'Bertoncello C', 'Destefani E', 'Gennari M', 'Stano A', 'Baldo V']",2018,30,1,Ann Ig,"Baldovin T, et al.

29195186,Medium shapes the microbial community of water filters with implications for effluent quality.,"Little is known about the forces that determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities inhabiting drinking water treatment filters and how this affects drinking water quality. Two contrasting ecological theories can help to understand how natural microbial communities assemble; niche theory and neutral theory, where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors predominate respectively. This study investigates the development of the microbial community on two common contrasting filter materials (quartz sand and granular activated carbon-GAC), to elucidate the main factors governing their assembly, through the evaluation of environmental (i.e. filter medium type) and stochastic forces (random deaths, births and immigration). Laboratory-scale filter columns were used to mimic a rapid gravity filter; the microbiome of the filter materials, and of the filter influent and effluent, was characterised using next generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and flow-cytometry. Chemical parameters (i.e. dissolved organic carbon, trihalomethanes formation) were also monitored to assess the final effluent quality. The filter communities seemed to be strongly assembled by selection rather than neutral processes, with only 28% of those OTUs shared with the source water detected on the filter medium following predictions using a neutral community model. GAC hosted a phylogenetically more diverse community than sand. The two filter media communities seeded the effluent water, triggering differences in both water quality and community composition of the effluents. Overall, GAC proved to be better than sand in controlling microbial growth, by promoting higher bacterial decay rates and hosting less bacterial cells, and showed better performance for putative pathogen control by leaking less Legionella cells into the effluent water.","['Vignola M', 'Werner D', 'Wade MJ', 'Meynet P', 'Davenport RJ']",2018,129,,Water Res,"Vignola M, et al.

29190490,Legionella quorum sensing and its role in pathogen-host interactions.,"Legionella pneumophila is a water-borne opportunistic pathogen causing a life-threatening pneumonia called 'Legionnaires' disease'. The Legionella quorum sensing (Lqs) system produces and responds to the α-hydroxyketone signaling molecule 3-hydroxypentadecane-4-one (Legionella autoinducer-1, LAI-1). The Lqs system controls the switch between the replicative/non-virulent and the transmissive/virulent phase of L. pneumophila, and it is a major regulator of natural competence, motility and virulence of the pathogen. Yet, beyond gene regulation, LAI-1 also directly affects pathogen-host interactions, since the signaling molecule modulates the migration of eukaryotic cells. Genes encoding Lqs homologues are present in many environmental bacteria, suggesting that α-hydroxyketone signaling is widely used for inter-bacterial as well as inter-kingdom signaling. In this review we summarize recent advances on the characterization of the Lqs system and its role in L. pneumophila-host cell interactions.","['Personnic N', 'Striednig B', 'Hilbi H']",2018,41,,Curr Opin Microbiol,"Personnic N, et al.

29181967,Legionellosis in Poland in 2015.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the epidemiological situation of legionellosis in Poland in 2015 in comparison to the preceding years.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed data published in the annual bulletin: “Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2015” and its prior versions along with the legionellosis case reports sent from Sanitary- Epidemiological Stations to the Department of Epidemiology of NIPH - NIH.
RESULTS: In Poland, both two forms of legionellosis - Legionnaires’ disease (a severe form of disease accompanied by pneumonia) and Pontiac fever (mild, influenza-like form of infection) - are notifiable. In 2015, a total of 23 cases of Legionnaires’ disease have been reported (there were no reports of Pontiac fever). The annual incidence rate 0.060 (per 100,000 population) slightly increased when compared to previous year as well as to the median (incidence) for 2009-2013. The infections were reported in 10 provinces, including five, which in previous years usually did not register any cases; however, there is a number of provinces that did not identify any LD cases in recent years. The incidence in males (0.097 per 100,000) was almost 4-times higher compared to females (0.025). Except for one cluster of two, all cases were sporadic; All patients required hospitalization. The Sanitary Inspection reported four fatal cases – all men 43- 67 years/old. Eighteen cases were likely acquired in the country, including a cluster of two cases linked with contaminated building water system. Four cases were associated with travels abroad (to Russia, Croatia, United Arab Emirates and USA) and in one case the exposure occurred during the transport of goods (lorry driver).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests, that legionellosis is likely under recognized and under diagnosed in all provinces of the country. Geographical variations in incidence may reflect local differences in availability of laboratory tests for LD. Number of detected cases - without information on the number of laboratory tests performed - do not appear to be sufficient to fully assess the epidemiological situation.","['Stypułkowska-Misiurewicz H', 'Czerwiński M']",2017,71,3,Przegl Epidemiol,Stypułkowska-Misiurewicz H and Czerwiński M.

29177692,Dermatological Complications After Solid Organ Transplantation.,"Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) are a population at high risk for cutaneous adverse events. Their early recognition and appropriate treatment is an important component of the clinical management of OTRs and should be optimally dealt with by dermatologists working in the context of a transplant dermatology clinic. Skin examination should be a standard procedure before performing organ transplantation to assess conditions which may be difficult to manage after the transplant procedure has been performed or which may represent a contraindication to transplantation, e.g., malignant melanoma. It also offers an opportunity to educate patients on skin care after organ transplantation. Skin infections can occur at any time after organ transplantation and include viral, bacterial, and fungal opportunistic infections. The risk of reactivation of latent viruses, such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), is high. Bacterial infections are frequent and may be caused by unusual agents such Actinomyces, Mycobacteria, Legionella, or Nocardia. A large spectrum of fungal infections may occur, ranging from superficial (e.g., dermatophytes) to deeper and more severe ones (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma). Drug-related idiosyncratic reactions usually occur early after the introduction of the causative drug, e.g., hypersensitivity reaction to azathioprine. On the long-term run, cutaneous effects due to cumulative drug toxicity, e.g., sebaceous hyperplasia from cyclosporine, may appear. Rare immunologically driven inflammatory reactions may occur in OTRs such as GVH or autoimmune disease. Tumors are particularly frequent. Kaposi's sarcoma, associated with persistent human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) infection, and cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) occur early after transplantation. Other cancers, such as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCs), associated with persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, malignant melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, or adnexal tumors, manifest later with an incidence which is much higher than observed in the general population. The incidence increases further after a first NMSC occurs.","['Naldi L', 'Venturuzzo A', 'Invernizzi P']",2018,54,1,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,"Naldi L, et al.

29176577,Disulfide loop cleavage of Legionella pneumophila PlaA boosts lysophospholipase A activity.,"L. pneumophila, an important facultative intracellular bacterium, infects the human lung and environmental protozoa. At least fifteen phospholipases A (PLA) are encoded in its genome. Three of which, namely PlaA, PlaC, and PlaD, belong to the GDSL lipase family abundant in bacteria and higher plants. PlaA is a lysophospholipase A (LPLA) that destabilizes the phagosomal membrane in absence of a protective factor. PlaC shows PLA and glycerophospholipid: cholesterol acyltransferase (GCAT) activities which are activated by zinc metalloproteinase ProA via cleavage of a disulphide loop. In this work, we compared GDSL enzyme activities, their secretion, and activation of PlaA. We found that PlaA majorly contributed to LPLA, PlaC to PLA, and both substrate-dependently to GCAT activity. Western blotting revealed that PlaA and PlaC are type II-secreted and both processed by ProA. Interestingly, ProA steeply increased LPLA but diminished GCAT activity of PlaA. Deletion of 20 amino acids within a predicted disulfide loop of PlaA had the same effect. In summary, we propose a model by which ProA processes PlaA via disulfide loop cleavage leading to a steep increase in LPLA activity. Our results help to further characterize the L. pneumophila GDSL hydrolases, particularly PlaA, an enzyme acting in the Legionella-containing phagosome.","['Lang C', 'Hiller M', 'Flieger A']",2017,7,1,Sci Rep,"Lang C, et al.

AnkC forms a dimer along the outer surface of loops between ARs. The dimer exists both in the crystal form and in solution, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. This is the first example of ARs as a dimerization module as opposed to solely a protein interaction domain. In addition, a novel α-helix insert between AR3-AR4 is positioned across the surface opposite the ankyrin groove. Sequence conservation suggests that the ankyrin groove of AnkC is a functional site that interacts with binding targets. This ankyrin domain structure is an important step towards a functional characterization of AnkC.","['Kozlov G', 'Wong K', 'Wang W', 'Skubák P', 'Muñoz-Escobar J', 'Liu Y', 'Siddiqui N', 'Pannu NS', 'Gehring K']",2018,495,1,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Kozlov G, et al.

29174976,Deposition pattern of aerosolized Legionella using an ex vivo human-porcine respiratory model.,"Legionella are bacteria responsible for severe lung pathologies. However how they enter and are deposited within the respiratory tract remains poorly documented. Data using animal testing led to the establishment of mathematical models allowing the estimation of aerosol dispersion risks. But direct extrapolation to humans is questionable and experimental models more physiologically representative of the inhalation route are welcome. The aim of this study was to develop a model as close as possible to the human anatomy and physiology allowing determining the deposition pattern of aerosolized Legionella while limiting in vivo experiments. To that purpose, we adapted the chimeric respiratory tract model we previously developed. This original model consisted of a replica of the human upper respiratory airways made by additive manufacturing connected to ex vivo porcine lungs ventilated by passive expansion, as for humans in physiological conditions. These experiments didn't imply specific animal sacrifices as pigs were bred for human consumption and lungs were considered as wastes by the slaughterhouse.

29173188,Innate Immune Surveillance in the Central Nervous System Following Legionella pneumophila Infection.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The innate immune response is a common occurrence in many neuroinflammatory diseases. Central Nervous System (CNS) resident immune cells are able to detect and react to infections and sterile trauma. Peripheral immune cell migration into CNS is regulated by the blood-brain barrier, although peripheral immune cells can invade CNS through meninges, choroid plexus, perivascular spaces, and cerebrospinal fluid. Consequently, in the brain, immune reactions can be mediated by both resident and peripheral immune cells. Both in the periphery and within the CNS, innate immune response is regulated by a wide array of pattern recognition receptors, including Tolllike, scavenger, Retinoic Acid-inducible Gene-1 like, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domainslike responsible for inflammasome formation. Inflammasome pathway activation induces pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory cell death pattern that occurs to remove intracellular pathogens. Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular microorganism responsible for Legionnaires' disease, a lung infection always associated to neurological dysfunctions. Recent studies have been shown that Toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains-like receptors, and RIG-1 like, are activated by L. pneumophila. This flagellated bacterium is able to replicate in phagocytic cells, including macrophages and microglia, responding by activating inflammasome pathways that may be the cause of CNS dysfunction detected in several infected patients.
CONCLUSION: The aim of this review is to bring together the latest findings concerning L. pneumophila infection and innate immune host cell responses. A deeper knowledge of these processes could allow the use of immunomodulatory compounds able to counteract CNS involvement following L. pneumophila infection.","['Lagana P', 'Soraci L', 'Gambuzza ME', 'Mancuso G', 'Delia SA']",2017,16,10,CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets,"Lagana P, et al.

29166595,Positive and Negative Regulation of the Master Metabolic Regulator mTORC1 by Two Families of Legionella pneumophila Effectors.,"All pathogens must acquire nutrients from their hosts. The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila, the etiological agent of Legionnaires' disease, requires host amino acids for growth within cells. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of host amino acid metabolism. Here, we identify two families of translocated L. pneumophila effector proteins that exhibit opposing effects on mTORC1 activity. The Legionella glucosyltransferase (Lgt) effector family activates mTORC1, through inhibition of host translation, whereas the SidE/SdeABC (SidE) effector family acts as mTORC1 inhibitors. We demonstrate that a common activity of both effector families is to inhibit host translation. We propose that the Lgt and SidE families of effectors work in concert to liberate host amino acids for consumption by L. pneumophila.","['De Leon JA', 'Qiu J', 'Nicolai CJ', 'Counihan JL', 'Barry KC', 'Xu L', 'Lawrence RE', 'Castellano BM', 'Zoncu R', 'Nomura DK', 'Luo ZQ', 'Vance RE']",2017,21,8,Cell Rep,"De Leon JA, et al.

It was found that sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin greatly promoted the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium and its broader genus Mycobacterium spp., as well as the amoebae Acanthamoeba spp. and Hartmanella vermiformis, in bulk water of DWDSs. Moreover, sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin exhibited much stronger combined effects on the increase of these opportunistic pathogens. Based on the analysis of the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), it was verified that EPS production was increased by the antibiotic resistant bacteria arising from the effects of sulfadiazine/ciprofloxacin. The combined effects of sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin induced the greatest increase of EPS production in DWDSs. Furthermore, the increased EPS with higher contents of proteins and secondary structure β-sheet led to greater bacterial aggregation and adsorption. Meanwhile, large numbers of suspended particles were formed, increasing the chlorine-resistance capability, which was responsible for the enhancement of the particle-associated opportunistic pathogens in bulk water of DWDSs with sulfadiazine/ciprofloxacin. Therefore, sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin promoted the occurrence of particle-associated opportunistic pathogens in bulk water of DWDSs due to the role of EPS produced by the bacteria with ARGs.","['Wang H', 'Shen Y', 'Hu C', 'Xing X', 'Zhao D']",2018,234,,Environ Pollut,"Wang H, et al.

29155867,Spectrum of pathogen- and model-specific histopathologies in mouse models of acute pneumonia.,"Pneumonia may be caused by a wide range of pathogens and is considered the most common infectious cause of death in humans. Murine acute lung infection models mirror human pathologies in many aspects and contribute to our understanding of the disease and the development of novel treatment strategies. Despite progress in other fields of tissue imaging, histopathology remains the most conclusive and practical read out tool for the descriptive and semiquantitative evaluation of mouse pneumonia and therapeutic interventions. Here, we systematically describe and compare the distinctive histopathological features of established models of acute pneumonia in mice induced by Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, influenza A virus (IAV) and superinfection of IAV-incuced pneumonia with S. pneumoniae. Systematic comparisons of the models revealed striking differences in the distribution of lesions, the characteristics of pneumonia induced, principal inflammatory cell types, lesions in adjacent tissues, and the detectability of the pathogens in histological sections. We therefore identified core criteria for each model suitable for practical semiquantitative scoring systems that take into account the pathogen- and model-specific patterns of pneumonia. Other critical factors that affect experimental pathologies are discussed, including infectious dose, time kinetics, and the genetic background of the mouse strain. The substantial differences between the model-specific pathologies underscore the necessity of pathogen- and model-adapted criteria for the comparative quantification of experimental outcomes. These criteria also allow for the standardized validation and comparison of treatment strategies in preclinical models.","['Dietert K', 'Gutbier B', 'Wienhold SM', 'Reppe K', 'Jiang X', 'Yao L', 'Chaput C', 'Naujoks J', 'Brack M', 'Kupke A', 'Peteranderl C', 'Becker S', 'von Lachner C', 'Baal N', 'Slevogt H', 'Hocke AC', 'Witzenrath M', 'Opitz B', 'Herold S', 'Hackstein H', 'Sander LE', 'Suttorp N', 'Gruber AD']",2017,12,11,PLoS One,"Dietert K, et al.

Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins function as cytosolic innate immune sensors in plants and animals. However, the structural basis for ligand-induced NLR activation has so far remained unknown. NAIP5 (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein 5) binds the bacterial protein flagellin and assembles with NLRC4 to form a multiprotein complex called an inflammasome. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the assembled ~1.4-megadalton flagellin-NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome, revealing how a ligand activates an NLR. Six distinct NAIP5 domains contact multiple conserved regions of flagellin, prying NAIP5 into an open and active conformation. We show that innate immune recognition of multiple ligand surfaces is a generalizable strategy that limits pathogen evolution and immune escape.","['Tenthorey JL', 'Haloupek N', 'López-Blanco JR', 'Grob P', 'Adamson E', 'Hartenian E', 'Lind NA', 'Bourgeois NM', 'Chacón P', 'Nogales E', 'Vance RE']",2017,358,6365,Science,"Tenthorey JL, et al.

In the present study, three species of Hyalomma ticks, Hyalomma aegyptium, H. marginatum and H. excavatum, were examined for the presence of zoonotic bacteria, both male and female ticks alike. Examination of microbial diversity with tag-encoded pyrosequencing indicates that H. marginatum and H. excavatum were more diversity rich than H. aegyptium.

29108710,Secreted phospholipases of the lung pathogen Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen and the main causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, a potentially fatal pneumonia. The bacteria infect both mammalian cells and environmental hosts, such as amoeba. Inside host cells, the bacteria withstand the multifaceted defenses of the phagocyte and replicate within a unique membrane-bound compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). For establishment and maintenance of the infection, L. pneumophila secretes many proteins including effector proteins by means of different secretion systems and outer membrane vesicles. Among these are a large variety of lipolytic enzymes which possess phospholipase/lysophospholipase and/or glycerophospholipid:cholesterol acyltransferase activities. Secreted lipolytic activities may contribute to bacterial virulence, for example via modification of eukaryotic membranes, such as the LCV. In this review, we describe the secretion systems of L. pneumophila, introduce the classification of phospholipases, and summarize the state of the art on secreted L. pneumophila phospholipases. We especially highlight those enzymes secreted via the type II secretion system Lsp, via the type IVB secretion system Dot/Icm, via outer membrane vesicles, and such where the mode of secretion has not yet been defined. We also give an overview on the complexity of their activities, activation mechanisms, localization, growth-phase dependent abundance, and their role in infection.","['Hiller M', 'Lang C', 'Michel W', 'Flieger A']",2018,308,1,Int J Med Microbiol,"Hiller M, et al.

This increase has been molecular epidemiologically linked with the emergence of a new genetically distinct clone, designated clade 3. We sought to extend our understanding of this epidemic behavior by the genetic characterization of type emm89 strains responsible in recent years for an increased frequency of infections in Scotland.
METHODOLOGY: We sequenced the genomes of a retrospective cohort of 122 emm89 strains recovered from patients with invasive and noninvasive infections throughout Scotland during 2010 to 2016.
RESULTS: All but one of the 122 emm89 infection isolates are of the recently emerged epidemic clade 3 clonal lineage. The Scotland isolates are closely related to and not genetically distinct from recent emm89 strains from England, they constitute a single genetic population.
CONCLUSIONS: The clade 3 clone causes virtually all-contemporary emm89 infections in Scotland.

The innate immune system is generally able to sense and -in most cases- control L. pneumophila infection. Comorbidities and genetic risk factors, however, can compromise the immune system and high infection doses might overwhelm its capacity, thereby enabling L. pneumophila to grow and disseminate inside the lung. The innate immune system mediates sensing of L. pneumophila by employing e.g. NOD-like receptors (NLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), as well as the cGAS/STING pathway to stimulate death of infected macrophages as well as production of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFNs). Control of pulmonary L. pneumophila infection is largely mediated by inflammasome-, TNFα- and IFN-dependent macrophage-intrinsic resistance mechanisms. This article summarizes the current knowledge of innate immune responses to L. pneumophila infection in general, and of macrophage-intrinsic defense mechanisms in particular.","['Naujoks J', 'Lippmann J', 'Suttorp N', 'Opitz B']",2018,308,1,Int J Med Microbiol,"Naujoks J, et al.

29092737,Oxalate nephropathy following vitamin C intake within intensive care unit .,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of acute oxalate nephropathy related to vitamin C intake within the intensive care unit (ICU).
DESIGN: Case report.
SETTING: ICU and nephrology department of a French university hospital.
PATIENT: A 57-year-old woman with septic shock related to <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury who required renal replacement therapy for 75 days.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A renal biopsy was performed on day 72 because of persistent anuria and because the patient showed characteristic features of severe acute oxalate nephropathy. The only cause identified was vitamin C intake received during hospitalization within the ICU (~ 30 g over 2.5 months). At month 6 after ICU admission, estimated glomerular filtration rate was 24 mL/min/1.73m
CONCLUSION: Compelling evidence obtained from in-vitro and animal studies suggest that vitamin C, a circulating antioxidant, may be a valuable adjunctive therapy in critically-ill patients. Data from humans are more conflicting. Oxalate, a well-known metabolite of vitamin C, is excreted by the kidneys and can exert a toxic effect on epithelial cells and causes direct tubular damage, and/or it can crystallize within the tubular lumen. This case highlights an under-recognized secondary adverse event from vitamin C given to critically-ill patients. The use of high-dose vitamin C should be prescribed with caution in this population. .","['Colliou E', 'Mari A', 'Delas A', 'Delarche A', 'Faguer S']",2017,88,12,Clin Nephrol,"Colliou E, et al.

29089378,pH of endophagosomes controls association of their membranes with Vps34 and PtdIns(3)P levels.,"Phagocytosis of filamentous bacteria occurs through tubular phagocytic cups (tPCs) and takes many minutes to engulf these filaments into phagosomes. Contravening the canonical phagocytic pathway, tPCs mature by fusing with endosomes. Using this model, we observed the sequential recruitment of early and late endolysosomal markers to the elongating tPCs. Surprisingly, the regulatory early endosomal lipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) persists on tPCs as long as their luminal pH remains neutral. Interestingly, by manipulating cellular pH, we determined that PtdIns(3)P behaves similarly in canonical phagosomes as well as endosomes. We found that this is the product of a pH-based mechanism that induces the dissociation of the Vps34 class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase from these organelles as they acidify. The detachment of Vps34 stops the production of PtdIns(3)P, allowing for the turnover of this lipid by PIKfyve. Given that PtdIns(3)P-dependent signaling is important for multiple cellular pathways, this mechanism for pH-dependent regulation of Vps34 could be at the center of many PtdIns(3)P-dependent cellular processes.","['Naufer A', 'Hipolito VEB', 'Ganesan S', 'Prashar A', 'Zaremberg V', 'Botelho RJ', 'Terebiznik MR']",2018,217,1,J Cell Biol,"Naufer A, et al. pH of endophagosomes controls association of their membranes with Vps34 and PtdIns(3)P levels. pH of endophagosomes controls association of their membranes with Vps34 and PtdIns(3)P levels. 2018; 217:329-346. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201702179",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29089378/

29069349,Legionella Becoming a Mutualist: Adaptive Processes Shaping the Genome of Symbiont in the Louse Polyplax serrata.,"Legionellaceae are intracellular bacteria known as important human pathogens. In the environment, they are mainly found in biofilms associated with amoebas. In contrast to the gammaproteobacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, which established a broad spectrum of symbioses with many insect taxa, the only instance of legionella-like symbiont has been reported from lice of the genus Polyplax. Here, we sequenced the complete genome of this symbiont and compared its main characteristics to other Legionella species and insect symbionts. Based on rigorous multigene phylogenetic analyses, we confirm this bacterium as a member of the genus Legionella and propose the name Candidatus Legionella polyplacis, sp.n. We show that the genome of Ca. Legionella polyplacis underwent massive degeneration, including considerable size reduction (529.746 bp, 484 protein coding genes) and a severe decrease in GC content (23%). We identify several possible constraints underlying the evolution of this bacterium. On one hand, Ca. Legionella polyplacis and the louse symbionts Riesia and Puchtella experienced convergent evolution, perhaps due to adaptation to similar hosts. On the other hand, some metabolic differences are likely to reflect different phylogenetic positions of the symbionts and hence availability of particular metabolic function in the ancestor. This is exemplified by different arrangements of thiamine metabolism in Ca. Legionella polyplacis and Riesia. Finally, horizontal gene transfer is shown to play a significant role in the adaptive and diversification process. Particularly, we show that Ca. L. polyplacis horizontally acquired a complete biotin operon (bioADCHFB) that likely assisted this bacterium when becoming an obligate mutualist.","['Ríhová J', 'Nováková E', 'Husník F', 'Hypša V']",2017,9,11,Genome Biol Evol,"Ríhová J, et al.

29051595,"A virus carries a gene encoding juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase, a key regulatory enzyme in insect metamorphosis.","Microbial parasitism, infection, and symbiosis in animals often modulate host endocrine systems, resulting in alterations of phenotypic traits of the host that can have profound effects on the ecology and evolution of both the microorganisms and their hosts. Information about the mechanisms and genetic bases of such modulations by animal parasites is available from studies of steroid hormones. However, reports involving other hormones are scarce. We found that an insect virus, a betaentomopoxvirus, encodes a juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase that can synthesize an important insect hormone, the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that this gene is of bacterial origin. Our study challenges the conventional view that functional enzymes in the late phase of the juvenile hormone biosynthesis pathway are almost exclusive to insects or arthropods, and shed light on juvenoid hormone synthesis beyond Eukaryota. This striking example demonstrates that even animal parasites having no metabolic pathways for molecules resembling host hormones can nevertheless influence the synthesis of such hormones, and provides a new context for studying animal parasite strategies in diverse systems such as host-parasite, host-symbiont or host-vector-parasite.","['Takatsuka J', 'Nakai M', 'Shinoda T']",2017,7,1,Sci Rep,"Takatsuka J, et al.

We present a scheme followed in order to track down and identify the source of infection in a tourist suffering from L. pneumophila sg 5 infection, who was accommodated in seven different hotels during his holidays in the island of Crete, and we comment on various difficulties and draw-backs of the process.
METHOD: Water samples were collected from the seven hotels where the patient had resided and analyzed at the regional public health laboratory using cultivation and molecular tests.
RESULTS: Of 103 water samples analyzed, 19 (18.4%) were positive for Legionella non-pneumophila and 8 (7.8%) were positive for L. pneumophila. A successful L. pneumophila sg 5 match was found between the clinical and environmental sample, which led us to the final identification of the liable hotel.
CONCLUSION: Timely notification of the case, within the the European Legionnaires' Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet) of the partners involved, is crucial during a course of travel associated with Legionella case investigation. Moreover, the urinary antigen test alone cannot provide sufficient information for the source identification. However, acquiring clinical as well as environmental isolates for serogroup and SBT identification is highly important for the successful matching.","['Chochlakis D', 'Sandalakis V', 'Keramarou M', 'Tselentis Y', 'Psaroulaki A']",2017,25,3,Cent Eur J Public Health,"Chochlakis D, et al.

The fine-tuning of lipid metabolic pathways is particularly important for the parasites during the rapid erythrocytic infection cycles, and thus enzymes involved in lipid metabolic processes represent prime targets for malaria chemotherapeutics. While plasmodial enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and acquisition have been studied in the past, to date not much is known about the roles of phospholipases for proliferation and transmission of the malaria parasite. These phospholipid-hydrolyzing esterases are crucial for membrane dynamics during host cell infection and egress by the parasite as well as for replication and cell signaling, and thus they are considered important virulence factors. In this review, we provide a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of plasmodial phospholipases identified to date. We further summarize previous findings on the lipid metabolism of Plasmodium, highlight the roles of phospholipases during parasite life-cycle progression, and discuss the plasmodial phospholipases as potential targets for malaria therapy.","['Flammersfeld A', 'Lang C', 'Flieger A', 'Pradel G']",2018,308,1,Int J Med Microbiol,"Flammersfeld A, et al.

To bridge the existing gap between the concentration of Legionella in a water network and the deposition of bacteria within the thoracic region (assessment of the number of viable Legionella), we validated a model mimicking realistic exposure through the use of (i) recent technology for aerosol generation and (ii) a 3D replicate of the human upper respiratory tract. The model's sensitivity was determined by monitoring the deposition of (i) aerosolized water and Tc99m radio-aerosol as controls, and (ii) bioaerosols generated from both Escherichia coli and Legionella pneumophila sg 1 suspensions. The numbers of viable Legionella prior to and after nebulization were provided by culture, flow cytometry and qPCR. This study was designed to obtain more realistic data on aerosol inhalation (vs. animal experimentation) and deposition at the thoracic region in the context of LD. Upon nebulization, 40% and 48% of the initial Legionella inoculum was made of cultivable and non-cultivable cells, respectively; 0.7% of both populations reached the filter holder mimicking the thoracic region in this setup. These results are in agreement with experimental data based on quantitative microbial risk assessment methods and bring new methods that may be useful for preventing LD.","['Pourchez J', 'Leclerc L', 'Girardot F', 'Riffard S', 'Prevot N', 'Allegra S']",2017,12,10,PLoS One,"Pourchez J, et al.

28981235,[Lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent adult].,"Lower respiratory tract infections represent one of the main causes of mortality in the world. They essentially consist of bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary diseases (COPD) and acute pneumonia. If acute bronchitis is mainly of viral origin, acute exacerbations of COPD and pneumonia are mainly due to a trio of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis). Other pathogens as many viruses and atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella, some Enterobacteriaceae and very rarely Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also implicated. S. pneumoniae is the pathogen associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality and empirical antibiotic treatment should always be active on this germ. According to the type of infection and factors of comorbidity, empirical antibiotic treatment should cover a number of other pathogens. Beta-lactams, associated or not with macrolides/azalides are the first line treatment. Fluoroquinolones, although highly active against all pathogens, must be used only in restricted situations in order to avoid emergence of resistance to these antibiotics.",['Jacobs F'],2017,38,4,Rev Med Brux,Jacobs F.

28965724,A Delicate Connection: c-di-AMP Affects Cell Integrity by Controlling Osmolyte Transport.,"Bacteria use second-messenger molecules to adapt to their environment. Several second messengers, among them cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), have been discovered and intensively studied. Interestingly, c-di-AMP is essential for growth of Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Many studies demonstrated that perturbation of c-di-AMP metabolism affects the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope. Therefore, it has been assumed that the nucleotide is essential for proper cell envelope synthesis. In this Opinion paper, we propose that the cell envelope phenotypes caused by perturbations of c-di-AMP metabolism can be interpreted differently: c-di-AMP might indirectly control cell envelope integrity by modulating the turgor, a physical variable that needs to be tightly adjusted. We also discuss open questions related to c-di-AMP metabolism that need to be urgently addressed by future studies.","['Commichau FM', 'Gibhardt J', 'Halbedel S', 'Gundlach J', 'Stülke J']",2018,26,3,Trends Microbiol,"Commichau FM, et al.

28964650,Community-acquired Legionnaires' disease at a medical center in northern Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Legionella pneumophila had been recognized as an important pathogen for community-acquired pneumonia. We aimed to investigate clinical features and outcomes of patients with Legionnaires' disease at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan.
METHODS: From June 2012 to February 2017, a retrospective review of adult community-acquired. Legionnaires' disease at a medical center was conducted. All Legionella infections were confirmed by positive urinary Legionella antigen assay, sera indirect immunofluorescence assay, or sputum culture for Legionella. Literature review of Legionnaires' disease from Medline and PubMED websites was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 32 cases of Legionnaires' disease were identified. Their mean age was 64.3 years, with male predominance (27 cases, 84.3%). The underlying diseases were varied and most were attributed to chronic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus (31%) and cigarette smoking (40.6%). The most common symptoms were cough (68%) and fever (59.3%). More than half of patients (18, 56.2%) with Legionnaires' disease could initially present with extrapulmonary manifestations. Sixteen (50%) patients had delay in initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Patients without adequately initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy had higher proportion (11 of 16, 68.7%) of intensive care unit admission than patients with adequate initiation (5 of 16, 31.2%). Our results inferred that a delay in treatment might result in worsening of disease severity and the need for more intensive management. Overall mortality rate was 21.8%. Development of vasopressor requirement is an independent risk factor associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Legionnaires' disease in Taiwan frequently present with extrapulmonary manifestations.

28951197,Clinical presentation of Legionella pneumonia: Evaluation of clinical scoring systems and therapeutic efficacy.,"To evaluate scoring systems to predict Legionella pneumonia and therapeutic efficacy against Legionella pneumonia, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy Legionella committee has collected data on cases of Legionella pneumonia from throughout Japan. We analyzed 176 patients with Legionella pneumonia and compared them with 217 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia and 202 patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. We evaluated four scoring systems, the Winthrop-University Hospital score, Community-Based Pneumonia Incidence Study Group score, and Japan Respiratory Society score, but they demonstrated limited sensitivity and specificity for predicting Legionella pneumonia. Using six clinical and laboratory parameters (high fever, high C-reactive protein, high lactate dehydrogenase, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and unproductive cough) reported by Fiumefreddo and colleagues, only 6% had Legionnella pneumonia when less than 2 parameters were present. The efficacy rates of antibiotics at the time of termination were 94.6% for intravenous antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and pazufloxacin, and 95.5% for oral antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, garenoxacin, moxifloxacin, and clarithromycin. Our results suggested that the previously reported clinical scoring systems to predict Legionnella pneumonia are not useful, but 6 simple diagnostic score accurately ruled out Legionnella pneumonia, which may help to optimize initial empiric therapy. Quinolones and clarithromycin still showed good clinical efficacy against Legionella pneumonia.","['Miyashita N', 'Higa F', 'Aoki Y', 'Kikuchi T', 'Seki M', 'Tateda K', 'Maki N', 'Uchino K', 'Ogasawara K', 'Kiyota H', 'Watanabe A']",2017,23,11,J Infect Chemother,"Miyashita N, et al.

The diagnosis of the acute phase of the disease can be established by the detection of Legionella antigen in urine and by PCR/real-time PCR detection of Legionella DNA in serum and lower respiratory tract and urine samples. Cultivation on specific media remains the gold standard, but this very demanding method is rarely used. Serological testing requires paired samples and thus is relevant to the diagnosis at a later stage of infection, although it is to be noted that about 20% of patients do not produce the antibodies.

RsmE methyltransferases methylate specifically this position in a mechanism that requires an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) molecule as cofactor. Here we report the structure of Apo and AdoMet-bound Lpg2936 from Legionella pneumophila at 1.5 and 2.3 Å, respectively. The protein comprises an N-terminal PUA domain and a C-terminal SPOUT domain. The latter is responsible for protein dimerization and cofactor binding. Comparison with similar structures suggests that Lpg2936 is an RsmE-like enzyme that can target the equivalent of U1498 in the L. pneumophila ribosomal RNA, thereby potentially enhancing ribosomal activity during infection-mediated effector production. The multiple copies of the enzyme found in both structures reveal a flexible conformation of the bound AdoMet ligand. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements suggest an asymmetric two site binding mode. Our results therefore also provide unprecedented insights into AdoMet/RsmE interaction, furthering our understanding of the RsmE catalytic mechanism.","['Pinotsis N', 'Waksman G']",2017,26,12,Protein Sci,Pinotsis N and Waksman G.

Macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells constitute the first line of defense and together orchestrate the initial steps of host defense. In this study, we analysed the influence of macrophages on type II alveolar epithelial cells during Legionella pneumophila-infection by a systems biology approach combining experimental work and mathematical modelling. We found that L. pneumophila-infected THP-1-derived macrophages provoke a pro-inflammatory activation of neighboring lung epithelial cells, but in addition render them hypo-responsive to direct infection with the same pathogen. We generated a kinetic mathematical model of macrophage activation and identified a paracrine mechanism of macrophage-secreted IL-1β inducing a prolonged IRAK-1 degradation in lung epithelial cells. This intercellular crosstalk may help to avoid an overwhelming inflammatory response by preventing excessive local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thereby negatively regulating the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. This suggests an important but ambivalent immunomodulatory role of macrophages in lung infection.","['Schulz C', 'Lai X', 'Bertrams W', 'Jung AL', 'Sittka-Stark A', 'Herkt CE', 'Janga H', 'Zscheppang K', 'Stielow C', 'Schulte L', 'Hippenstiel S', 'Vera J', 'Schmeck B']",2017,7,1,Sci Rep,"Schulz C, et al.

28917570,Detection of viable but non-culturable legionella in hospital water network following monochloramine disinfection.,"BACKGROUND: Prevention of legionellosis remains a critical issue in healthcare settings where monochloramine (MC) disinfection was recently introduced as an alternative to chlorine dioxide in controlling Legionella spp. contamination of the hospital water network. Continuous treatments with low MC doses in some instances have induced a viable but non-culturable state (VBNC) of Legionella spp.
AIM: To investigate the occurrence of such dormant cells during a long period of continuous MC treatment.
METHODS: Between November 2010 and April 2015, 162 water and biofilm samples were collected and Legionella spp. isolated in accordance with standard procedures. In sampling sites where MC was <1.5mg/L, VBNC cells were investigated by ethidium monoazide bromide (EMA)-real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 'resuscitation' test into Acanthamoeba polyphaga CCAP 1501/18. According to the Health Protection Agency protocol, free-living protozoa were researched in 60 five-litre water samples.
FINDINGS: In all, 136 out of 156 (87.2%) of the samples taken from sites previously positive for L. pneumophila ST269 were negative by culture, but only 47 (34.5%) negative by qPCR. Although no positive results were obtained by EMA-qPCR, four out of 22 samples associated with MC concentration of 1.3 ± 0.5mg/L showed VBNC legionella resuscitation. The presence of the amoeba A. polyphaga in the hospital water network was demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: Our study is the first report evidencing the emergence of VNBC legionella during a long period of continuous MC treatment of a hospital water network, highlighting the importance of keeping an appropriate and uninterrupted MC dosage to ensure the control of legionella colonization in hospital water supplies.","['Casini B', 'Baggiani A', 'Totaro M', 'Mansi A', 'Costa AL', 'Aquino F', 'Miccoli M', 'Valentini P', 'Bruschi F', 'Lopalco PL', 'Privitera G']",2018,98,1,J Hosp Infect,"Casini B, et al.

Microbial pathogens have evolved virulence factors that reprogram these host signaling responses, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.

We show that over 30% of the effectors localize to yeast and mammalian cell membranes, including a subset of previously uncharacterized Legionella effectors that appear to be able to regulate yeast vacuolar fusion. A combined genetic, cellular, and biochemical approach supports that some of the tested bacterial effectors can bind to membrane phospholipids and may regulate membrane trafficking.

28900525,A case of Legionella pneumophila evaluated with CT and ultrasound.,"A 36-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of ""SS Annunziata"" hospital in Chieti complaining of a sharp chest pain arisen some hours before admission. On examination, the patient looked sweaty; his vital signs showed tachycardia and augmented breath rate; sinus tachycardia and normal ventricular repolarization were observed on ECG, and no abnormalities were observed in the echoscan of the hearth. According to the clinical and electrocardiographic findings, and to previous episode of DVT in anamnesis, a thorax CT scan was performed in order to rule out pulmonary embolism. It showed an ""area of parenchymal consolidation involving almost all the left lower lobe with patent bronchial structures""; given the patient's CURB 65 score, he was then admitted to the pneumology ward where empiric treatment with levofloxacin (750 mg PO once daily) was initiated. Thoracic ultrasound was performed using a multifrequency convex transducer, and the posterior left area was examined through intercostal approach, placing the patient in a sitting position. A subpleural patchy hypoechoic lesion with irregular boundaries was detected; the maximum diameter was 11 cm, and the multiple hyperechoic spots inside it (elsewhere defined as ""air bronchogram"") showed no Doppler signal. Given the positive result of the Legionella urinary antigen test, antibiotic treatment was switched to Levofloxacin 1000 mg PO once daily and Claritromicin 500 mg PO twice daily. After 3 days, his clinical conditions improved dramatically. Ultrasound performed after 5 days from the diagnosis showed decreased dimensions of the lesion previously identified (maximum diameter 8.25 cm) and a marked reduction of the hyperechoic spots in it. The patient was discharged in good clinical conditions, and both thorax CT scan obtained after 1 and 4 months from the diagnosis showed radiological resolution of the parenchymal consolidation. The key to ultrasound visualization of pneumonia is its contact with the pleural surface (86-98% in cases of CAP) and the relative loss of aeration of the portion involved by the infection and a concomitant increase in the fluid content. A paradigmatic US image for parenchymal inflammatory infiltrate has not been established yet; anyway, some typical findings, when combined with the clinical features, can confirm the diagnostic hypothesis.","[""D'Angelo A"", 'De Simone C', 'Pagnottella M', 'Rossi S', 'Pepe R', 'Ruggieri G', 'Cocco G', 'Schiavone C']",2017,20,3,J Ultrasound,"D'Angelo A, et al.

In this study, we evaluate the utility of v-qPCR versus culture method for Legionellosis risk management.
METHODS: The present study was performed using 116 real samples. Water samples were simultaneously analysed by culture, v-qPCR and qPCR methods. Results were compared by means of a non-parametric test.
RESULTS: In 11.6% of samples using both methods (culture method and v-qPCR) results were positive, in 50.0% of samples both methods gave rise to negative results. As expected, equivalence between methods was not observed in all cases, as in 32.1% of samples positive results were obtained by v-qPCR and all of them gave rise to negative results by culture. Only in 6.3% of samples, with very low Legionella levels, was culture positive and v-qPCR negative. In 3.5% of samples, overgrowth of other bacteria did not allow performing the culture. When comparing both methods, significant differences between culture and v-qPCR were in the samples belonging to the cooling towers-evaporative condensers group. The v-qPCR method detected greater presence and obtained higher concentrations of Legionella spp. (p<0.001). Otherwise, no significant differences between methods were found in the rest of the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The v-qPCR method can be used as a quick tool to evaluate Legionellosis risk, especially in cooling towers-evaporative condensers, where this technique can detect higher levels than culture. The combined interpretation of PCR results along with the ratio of live cells is proposed as a tool for understanding the sample context and estimating the Legionellosis risk potential according to 4 levels of hierarchy.","['Lizana X', 'López A', 'Benito S', 'Agustí G', 'Ríos M', 'Piqué N', 'Marqués AM', 'Codony F']",2017,220,8,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Lizana X, et al.

Additionally, varying EMA and PMA concentrations were analysed to determine which dye and concentration allowed for the optimal identification of viable cells. Viable, heat treated (70 °C for 15 min) and autoclaved cultures of Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were utilised in the respective viability assays. Analysis of the viable and heat-treated samples indicated that variable log reductions were recorded for both EMA [log reductions ranging from 0.01 to 2.71 (viable) and 0.27 to 2.85 (heat treated)], PMA [log reductions ranging from 0.06 to 1.02 (viable) and 0.62 to 2.46 (heat treated)] and DNase treatment [log reductions ranging from 0.06 to 0.82 (viable) and 0.70 to 2.91 (heat treated)], in comparison to the no viability treatment controls. Based on the results obtained, 6 μM EMA and 50 μM PMA were identified as the optimal dye concentrations as low log reductions were recorded (viable and heat-treated samples) in comparison to the no viability treatment control. In addition, the results recorded for the 6 μM EMA concentration were comparable to the results obtained for both the 50 μM PMA and the DNase treatment.

28873330,Differential expression of virulence genes in Legionella pneumophila growing in Acanthamoeba and human monocytes.,"Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is widely distributed throughout natural and artificial water systems and can replicate in macrophages and amoebae. Amoebae are the natural hosts of L. pneumophila, whereas macrophages are incidentally infected. The life cycle of L. pneumophila comprises a replicative phase within the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) and a transmissive phase during which bacterial cells become motile and are released via killing of the host. Although the host death mechanisms induced by L. pneumophila have been studied, the expression patterns of related L. pneumophila genes have not been reported. The present study compared the expression patterns of host cell death-associated genes in L. pneumophila grown in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and Acanthamoeba castellanii. Notably, when L. pneumophila was grown in THP-1, expression of the gene flaA, which is involved in the induction of pyroptosis, was downregulated during the course of infection. In contrast, sdhA associated indirectly with host death, was upregulated. Expression of the genes vipD and sidF, which are involved in the induction and suppression of apoptosis, changed by less than 2-fold. Notably, a lower percentage of pyroptotic cells was observed among infected THP-1 cells relative to uninfected cells, and the latter exhibited stronger expression of caspase-1. A different pattern was observed when L. pneumophila was grown in A. castellanii: flaA and vipD were activated, whereas sdhA and sidF were downregulated during the later stage of replication.

The lessons learned from the application of an ICS for large infectious disease outbreaks are documented. However, there is scant evidence on the application of an ICS to manage a local multiagency response to a disease cluster with environmental health risks. The Sydney Local Health District Public Health Unit (PHU) in New South Wales, Australia, was notified of 5 cases of Legionnaires' disease during 2 weeks in May 2016. This unusual incident triggered a multiagency investigation involving an ICS with staff from the PHU, 3 local councils, and the state health department to help prevent any further public health risk. The early and judicious use of ICS enabled a timely and effective response by supporting clear communication lines between the incident controller and field staff. The field team was key in preventing any ongoing public health risk through inspection, sampling, testing, and management of water systems identified to be at-risk for transmission of legionella. Good working relationships between partner agencies and trust in the technical proficiency of environmental health staff aided in the effective management of the response.

28869187,Growth of Legionella anisa in a model drinking water system to evaluate different shower outlets and the impact of cast iron rust.,"Legionella continues to be a problem in water systems. This study investigated the influence of different shower mixer faucets, and the influence of the presence of cast iron rust from a drinking water system on the growth of Legionella. The research is conducted using a model of a household containing four drinking water systems. All four systems, which contained standard plumbing components including copper pipes and a water heater, were filled with unchlorinated drinking water. Furthermore, all systems had three different shower faucets: (A) a stainless-steel faucet, (B) a brass-ceramic faucet, and (C) a brass thermostatic faucet. System 1 was solely filled with drinking water. System 2 was filled with drinking water, and cast iron rust. System 3 was contaminated with Legionella, and system 4 was contaminated with a Legionella, and cast iron rust. During a period of 34 months, 450 cold water samples were taken from 15 sample points of the four drinking water systems, and tested for Legionella according to the Dutch Standard (NEN 6265). In system 4, with added cast iron rust, the stainless-steel mixer faucet (A) had the highest concentration of Legionella at >4.3log10CFU/l (>20,000CFU/l) and was positive in 46.4% of samples. In contrast, the stainless-steel mixer faucet (A) of system 3 without cast iron rust showed 14.3% positive samples with a maximum concentration of 3.9log10CFU/l (7600CFU/l) Legionella. Additionally, both contaminated systems (3 and 4), with the brass thermostatic faucet (C), tested positive for Legionella. System 3 in 85.7% of the samples, with a maximum concentration of 4.38log10CFU/l (24,200CFU/l), and system 4 in 64.3% of the samples with a maximum concentration of 4.13log10CFU/l (13.400CFU/l). These results suggest that both the type of faucet used in a drinking water system and the presence or absence of cast iron rust influence the growth of Legionella.","['van der Lugt W', 'Euser SM', 'Bruin JP', 'Den Boer JW', 'Walker JT', 'Crespi S']",2017,220,8,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"van der Lugt W, et al.

28851372,Diagnostic testing for Legionnaires' disease.,"Legionnaires' disease is commonly diagnosed clinically using a urinary antigen test. The urinary antigen test is highly accurate for L. pneumophila serogroup 1, however other diagnostic tests should also be utilized in conjunction with the urinary antigen as many other Legionella species and serogroups are pathogenic. Culturing of patient specimens remains the gold standard for diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease. Selective media, BYCE with the addition of antibiotics, allows for a high sensitivity and specificity. Culturing can identify all species and serogroups of Legionella. A major benefit of culturing is that it provides the recovery of a patient isolate, which can be used to find an environmental match. Other diagnostic tests, including DFA and molecular tests such as PCR and LAMP, are useful tests to supplement culturing. Molecular tests provide much more rapid results in comparison to culture, however these tests should not be a primary diagnostic tool given their lower sensitivity and specificity in comparison to culturing.

To address the lack of epidemiological data linking the drinking water supplies to disease incidence, we gathered physiochemical and biological water quality data from 2010 to 2016 to evaluate characteristics of the Flint River water that were potentially conducive to Legionella growth. The treated Flint River water was 8.6 times more corrosive than Detroit water in short-term testing, releasing more iron, which is a key Legionella nutrient, while also directly causing disinfectant to decay more rapidly. The Flint River water source was also 0.8-6.7 °C warmer in summer months than Detroit water and exceeded the minimum Legionella growth temperature of 20 °C more frequently (average number of days per year for Detroit was 63 versus that for the Flint River, which was 157). The corrosive water also led to 1.3-2.2 times more water main breaks in 2014-2015 compared to 2010-2013; such disruptions have been associated with outbreaks in other locales. Importantly, Legionella spp. and Legionella pneumophila decreased after switching back to Detroit water, in terms of both gene markers and culturability, when August and October 2015 were compared to November 2016.","['Rhoads WJ', 'Garner E', 'Ji P', 'Zhu N', 'Parks J', 'Schwake DO', 'Pruden A', 'Edwards MA']",2017,51,20,Environ Sci Technol,"Rhoads WJ, et al.

28842705,The Legionella effector WipB is a translocated Ser/Thr phosphatase that targets the host lysosomal nutrient sensing machinery.,"Legionella pneumophila infects human alveolar macrophages and is responsible for Legionnaire's disease, a severe form of pneumonia. L. pneumophila encodes more than 300 putative effectors, which are translocated into the host cell via the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. These effectors highjack the host's cellular processes to allow bacterial intracellular growth and replication. Here we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to investigate WipB, a Dot/Icm effector of unknown function. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain at 1.7 Å resolution comprising residues 25 to 344 revealed that WipB harbours a Ser/Thr phosphatase domain related to the eukaryotic phospho-protein phosphatase (PPP) family. The C-terminal domain (residues 365-524) is sufficient to pilot the effector to acidified LAMP1-positive lysosomal compartments, where WipB interacts with the v-ATPase and the associated LAMTOR1 phosphoprotein, key components of the lysosomal nutrient sensing (LYNUS) apparatus that controls the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) kinase complex at the lysosomal surface. We propose that WipB is a lysosome-targeted phosphatase that modulates cellular nutrient sensing and the control of energy metabolism during Legionella infection.","['Prevost MS', 'Pinotsis N', 'Dumoux M', 'Hayward RD', 'Waksman G']",2017,7,1,Sci Rep,"Prevost MS, et al.

28815533,Hijacking of Membrane Contact Sites by Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens.,"Intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to hijack host cellular processes to promote their survival and replication inside host cells. Over the past two decades, much attention has been given to the strategies employed by these pathogens to manipulate various vesicular trafficking pathways. But in the past 5 years, studies have brought to light that intracellular bacteria also target non-vesicular trafficking pathways. Here we review how three vacuolar pathogens, namely, Legionella, Chlamydia, and Coxiella hijack components of cellular MCS with or without the formation of stable MCS. A common theme in the manipulation of MCS by intracellular bacteria is the dependence on the secretion of bacterial effector proteins. During the early stages of the Legionella life cycle, the bacteria connects otherwise unrelated cellular pathways (i.e., components of ER-PM MCS, PI4KIIIα, and Sac1 and the early secretory pathway) to remodel its nascent vacuole into an ER-like compartment. Chlamydia and Coxiella vacuoles establish direct MCS with the ER and target lipid transfer proteins that contain a FFAT motif, CERT, and ORP1L, respectively, suggesting a common mechanism of VAP-dependent lipid acquisition. Chlamydia also recruits STIM1, an ER calcium sensor involved in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) at ER-PM MCS, and elucidating the role of STIM1 at ER-Chlamydia inclusion MCS may uncover additional role for these contacts. Altogether, the manipulation of MCS by intracellular bacterial pathogens has open a new and exciting area of research to investigate the molecular mechanisms supporting pathogenesis.",['Derré I'],2017,997,,Adv Exp Med Biol,Derré I.

It is important to accurately and rapidly detect respiratory bacteria. To compensate for the limits of current respiratory bacteria detection methods, we developed a combination of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis (MPCE) assay to detect thirteen bacterial pathogens responsible for lower respiratory tract infections, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Bordetella pertussis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Streptococcus pyogenes.
METHODS: Three multiplex PCR reactions were built, and the products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using the high-throughput DNA analyzer. The specificity of the MPCE assay was examined and the detection limit was evaluated using DNA samples from each bacterial strain and the simulative samples of each strain. This assay was further evaluated using 152 clinical specimens and compared with real-time PCR reactions. For this assay, three nested-multiplex-PCRs were used to detect these clinical specimens.
RESULTS: The detection limits of the MPCE assay for the 13 pathogens were very low and ranged from 10-7 to 10-2 ng/μL. Furthermore, analysis of the 152 clinical specimens yielded a specificity ranging from 96.5%-100.0%, and a sensitivity of 100.0% for the 13 pathogens.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the MPCE assay is a rapid, reliable, and high-throughput method with high specificity and sensitivity. This assay has great potential in the molecular epidemiological survey of respiratory pathogens.","['Jiang LX', 'Ren HY', 'Zhou HJ', 'Zhao SH', 'Hou BY', 'Yan JP', 'Qin T', 'Chen Y']",2017,30,8,Biomed Environ Sci,"Jiang LX, et al.

28787681,Hotspots for selected metal elements and microbes accumulation and the corresponding water quality deterioration potential in an unchlorinated drinking water distribution system.,"Biofilm formation, loose deposit accumulation and water quality deterioration in drinking water distribution systems have been widely reported. However, the accumulation and distribution of harbored elements and microbes in the different niches (loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm) and their corresponding potential contribution to water quality deterioration remain unknown. This precludes an in-depth understanding of water quality deterioration and the development of proactive management strategies. The present study quantitatively evaluated the distribution of elements, ATP, Aeromonas spp., and bacterial communities in distribution pipes (PVC-U, D = 110 mm, loose deposit and biofilm niches) and household connection pipes (HDPE, D = 32 mm, HDPE biofilm niches) at ten locations in an unchlorinated distribution system. The results show that loose deposits in PVC-U pipes, acting as sinks, constitute a hotspot (highest total amount per meter pipe) for elements, ATP, and target bacteria groups (e.g., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Legionella spp.). When drinking water distribution system niches with harbored elements and microbes become sources in the event of disturbances, the highest quality deterioration potential (QDP) is that of HDPE biofilm; this can be attributed to its high surface-to-volume ratio. 16s rRNA analysis demonstrates that, at the genus level, the bacterial communities in the water, loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm were dominated, respectively, by Polaromonas spp. (2-23%), Nitrosipra spp. (1-47%), Flavobacterium spp. (1-36%), and Flavobacterium spp. (5-67%). The combined results of elemental composition and bacterial community analyses indicate that different dominant bio-chemical processes might occur within the different niches-for example, iron-arsenic oxidizing in loose deposits, bio-calumniation in PVC-U biofilm, and methane oxidizing in HDPE biofilm. The release of 20% loose deposits, 20% PVC-U biofilm and 10% HDPE biofilm will cause significant changes of water bacterial community.","['Liu G', 'Tao Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Lut M', 'Knibbe WJ', 'van der Wielen P', 'Liu W', 'Medema G', 'van der Meer W']",2017,124,,Water Res,"Liu G, et al.

The purpose of this study was to describe the susceptibility of clinical strains of L. pneumophila to eight antibiotics used for treatment of legionellosis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 109 well-characterised clinical strains of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 were determined by the broth microdilution method without charcoal and were compared with antibiotic-resistant strains selected in vitro. All strains were inhibited by low concentrations of fluoroquinolones, macrolides and rifampicin. The epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) were 0.064 mg/L for ciprofloxacin, 0.064 mg/L for moxifloxacin, 0.032 mg/L for levofloxacin, 1 mg/L for erythromycin, 2 mg/L for azithromycin, 0.064 mg/L for clarithromycin, 2 mg/L for doxycycline and 0.001 mg/L for rifampicin. However, MIC distributions revealed a subpopulation of strains displaying reduced susceptibility to some macrolides (especially azithromycin), which correlated with the presence of the lpeAB genes encoding a macrolide efflux pump found specifically in sequence type (ST) ST1, ST701 and closely related STs. Thus, all isolates could be considered susceptible to the tested antibiotics, although macrolides were less active against some strains harbouring a specific efflux system.","['Vandewalle-Capo M', 'Massip C', 'Descours G', 'Charavit J', 'Chastang J', 'Billy PA', 'Boisset S', 'Lina G', 'Gilbert C', 'Maurin M', 'Jarraud S', 'Ginevra C']",2017,50,5,Int J Antimicrob Agents,"Vandewalle-Capo M, et al.

Endocarditis and vascular infections are the most common serious complications of acute Q fever.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 63-year-old man that presented a mediastinitis associated with a prosthetic vascular infection. Serological cross-reaction was observed between Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and Legionella pneumophila with higher antibodies titer for L. pneumophila (IgG = 1:512) than for C. burnetii (phase I IgG = 1:400). We performed western blot with cross-adsorption that supports the diagnosis of C. burnetii infection. Two weeks later, a positive qPCR and culture for C. burnetii on swab taken from the mediastinal cutaneous fistula confirmed the definitive microbiological diagnosis of Q fever mediastinitis.
CONCLUSION: Cross-reactivity between C. burnetii and Legionella spp. has long been known and should be considered in patients with persistent infections. It is important to establish the definite diagnosis because the antibiotic treatment regimens and duration are significantly different. To the best of our knowledge, we reported here the first case of mediastinitis associated to C. burnetii and we diagnosed this persistent infection despite low anti-C. burnetii phase I IgG levels.","['Edouard S', 'Million M', 'Casalta JP', 'Collart F', 'Amphoux B', 'Raoult D']",2017,45,6,Infection,"Edouard S, et al.

L. pneumophila is one of the amoeba-resisting bacteria able to avoid host degradation by phagocytosis and to multiply inside the amoeba. When infecting its host, L. pneumophila injects hundreds of effectors via a type IV secretion system that change physiology of the amoeba to its profit. In this study, we assess mobility of A. castellanii upon infection with L. pneumophila. Electron-microscopy analysis of amoebae revealed a reduction of acanthopodia on cells infected with L. pneumophila. Analysis of velocity showed that migration of A. castellanii infected with L. pneumophila was significantly impaired compare to uninfected cells.

They have many important commercial applications in the food industry. We determined the crystal structure of an aminopeptidase LapB from Legionella pneumophila. The overall structure reveals that the N-terminal protease-associated (PA) domain presents a new fold and shields the active site cavity of the conserved C-terminal peptidase domain. The steady-state kinetic analysis of LapB and the PA domain deletion mutant indicate that the PA domain inhibited enzyme activity of the peptidase domain. Interestingly, the activity of LapB was largely increased by various organic solvents such as ethanol, propanol, and methanol at the concentration of 60% (v/v). CD analysis provided evidence that organic solvents induce the PA domain conformational changes that eliminate the inhibition role.

28771586,Inhibition of caspase-1 or gasdermin-D enable caspase-8 activation in the Naip5/NLRC4/ASC inflammasome.,"Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative, flagellated bacterium that survives in phagocytes and causes Legionnaires' disease. Upon infection of mammalian macrophages, cytosolic flagellin triggers the activation of Naip/NLRC4 inflammasome, which culminates in pyroptosis and restriction of bacterial replication. Although NLRC4 and caspase-1 participate in the same inflammasome, Nlrc4-/- mice and their macrophages are more permissive to L. pneumophila replication compared with Casp1/11-/-. This feature supports the existence of a pathway that is NLRC4-dependent and caspase-1/11-independent. Here, we demonstrate that caspase-8 is recruited to the Naip5/NLRC4/ASC inflammasome in response to flagellin-positive bacteria. Accordingly, caspase-8 is activated in Casp1/11-/- macrophages in a process dependent on flagellin, Naip5, NLRC4 and ASC. Silencing caspase-8 in Casp1/11-/- cells culminated in macrophages that were as susceptible as Nlrc4-/- for the restriction of L. pneumophila replication. Accordingly, macrophages and mice deficient in Asc/Casp1/11-/- were more susceptible than Casp1/11-/- and as susceptible as Nlrc4-/- for the restriction of infection. Mechanistically, we found that caspase-8 activation triggers gasdermin-D-independent pore formation and cell death. Interestingly, caspase-8 is recruited to the Naip5/NLRC4/ASC inflammasome in wild-type macrophages, but it is only activated when caspase-1 or gasdermin-D is inhibited. Our data suggest that caspase-8 activation in the Naip5/NLRC4/ASC inflammasome enable induction of cell death when caspase-1 or gasdermin-D is suppressed.","['Mascarenhas DPA', 'Cerqueira DM', 'Pereira MSF', 'Castanheira FVS', 'Fernandes TD', 'Manin GZ', 'Cunha LD', 'Zamboni DS']",2017,13,8,PLoS Pathog,"Mascarenhas DPA, et al.

Google Trends, a Google Inc. portal, generates data on geographical and temporal patterns according to specified keywords. The aim of this study was to compare the reliability of Google Trends in different clinical settings, for both common diseases with lower media coverage, and for less common diseases attracting major media coverage. We carried out a search in Google Trends using the keywords ""renal colic"", ""epistaxis"", and ""mushroom poisoning"", selected on the basis of available and reliable epidemiological data. Besides this search, we carried out a second search for three clinical conditions (i.e., ""meningitis"", ""Legionella Pneumophila pneumonia"", and ""Ebola fever""), which recently received major focus by the Italian media. In our analysis, no correlation was found between data captured from Google Trends and epidemiology of renal colics, epistaxis and mushroom poisoning. Only when searching for the term ""mushroom"" alone the Google Trends search generated a seasonal pattern which almost overlaps with the epidemiological profile, but this was probably mostly due to searches for harvesting and cooking rather than to for poisoning. The Google Trends data also failed to reflect the geographical and temporary patterns of disease for meningitis, Legionella Pneumophila pneumonia and Ebola fever. The results of our study confirm that Google Trends has modest reliability for defining the epidemiology of relatively common diseases with minor media coverage, or relatively rare diseases with higher audience. Overall, Google Trends seems to be more influenced by the media clamor than by true epidemiological burden.","['Cervellin G', 'Comelli I', 'Lippi G']",2017,7,3,J Epidemiol Glob Health,"Cervellin G, et al.

28753503,Disinfection of various bacterial pathogens using novel silver nanoparticle-decorated magnetic hybrid colloids.,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have long been considered a powerful disinfectant for controlling pathogenic microorganisms. However, AgNPs might have adverse effects on both human health and our ecosystems due to their potential cytotoxicity and the difficulty in recovering them after their release into the environment. In this study, we characterized the antimicrobial efficacy caused by a novel micrometer-sized magnetic hybrid colloid (MHC) containing 7, 15, or 30nm sized monodispersed AgNPs (AgNP-MHCs), which can be re-collected from the environment using simple procedures, such as a magnet or centrifugation. We evaluated the antibacterial capabilities of AgNP-MHCs against target bacteria (Legionella pneumophila, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens) and compared them with the inactivation efficacy of AgNPs ~30nm in diameter (nAg30s). Among the different AgNP-MHCs composites evaluated, Ag30-MHCs had the greatest antibacterial effect.

28740179,Legionella pneumophila infection activates bystander cells differentially by bacterial and host cell vesicles.,"Extracellular vesicles from eukaryotic cells and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released from gram-negative bacteria have been described as mediators of pathogen-host interaction and intercellular communication. Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is a causative agent of severe pneumonia. The differential effect of bacterial and host cell vesicles in L. pneumophila infection is unknown so far. We infected THP-1-derived or primary human macrophages with L. pneumophila and isolated supernatant vesicles by differential centrifugation. We observed an increase of exosomes in the 100 k pellet by nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, and protein markers. This fraction additionally contained Legionella LPS, indicating also the presence of OMVs. In contrast, vesicles in the 16 k pellet, representing microparticles, decreased during infection. The 100 k vesicle fraction activated uninfected primary human alveolar epithelial cells, A549 cells, and THP-1 cells. Epithelial cell activation was reduced by exosome depletion (anti-CD63, or GW4869), or blocking of IL-1β in the supernatant. In contrast, the response of THP-1 cells to vesicles was reduced by a TLR2-neutralizing antibody, UV-inactivation of bacteria, or - partially - RNase-treatment of vesicles. Taken together, we found that during L. pneumophila infection, neighbouring epithelial cells were predominantly activated by exosomes and cytokines, whereas myeloid cells were activated by bacterial OMVs.","['Jung AL', 'Herkt CE', 'Schulz C', 'Bolte K', 'Seidel K', 'Scheller N', 'Sittka-Stark A', 'Bertrams W', 'Schmeck B']",2017,7,1,Sci Rep,"Jung AL, et al.

We also evaluated the time and load of Legionella appearance in samples found negative using the standard culture method.
METHODS: A total of 42 samples was obtained from the tap water of five hospital buildings. The samples were tested for Legionella by the standard culture method and were monitored for up to 12 months for the appearance of VBNC Legionella.
RESULTS: All the 42 samples were negative at the time of collection. Seven of the 42 samples (17.0%) became positive for Legionella at different times of monitoring. The time to the appearance of VBNC Legionella was extremely variable, from 15 days to 9 months from sampling. The most frequent Legionella species observed were Legionella spp and L. anisa and only in one sample L. pneumophila srg.1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the presence of VBNC Legionella in samples resulting negative using the standard culture method and highlights the different time to its appearance that can occur several months after sampling.

These effectors are essential for the establishment of membrane-bound compartments known as replication vacuoles, which enable the survival and replication of bacteria inside host cells. The effectors interfere with diverse signalling pathways to co-opt host processes, such as vesicle trafficking, ubiquitylation, gene expression and lipid metabolism, to promote pathogen survival. In this Review, we explore Dot/Icm effectors from L. pneumophila and C. burnetii as key virulence factors, and we examine the biochemical and cell biological functions of these effectors and their roles in our understanding of bacterial virulence.","['Qiu J', 'Luo ZQ']",2017,15,10,Nat Rev Microbiol,Qiu J and Luo ZQ.

28698607,Divergent evolution of Di-lysine ER retention vs. farnesylation motif-mediated anchoring of the AnkB virulence effector to the Legionella-containing vacuolar membrane.,"Within macrophages and amoeba, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) membrane is derived from the ER. The bona fide F-box AnkB effector protein of L. pneumophila strain AA100/130b is anchored to the cytosolic side of the LCV membrane through host-mediated farnesylation of its C-terminal eukaryotic ""CaaX"" motif. Here we show that the AnkB homologue of the Paris strain has a frame shift mutation that led to a loss of the CaaX motif and a concurrent generation of a unique C-terminal KNKYAP motif, which resembles the eukaryotic di-lysine ER-retention motif (KxKxx). Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that environmental isolates of L. pneumophila have a potential positive selection for the ER-retention KNKYAP motif. The AnkB-Paris effector is localized to the LCV membrane most likely through the ER-retention motif. Its ectopic expression in HEK293T cells localizes it to the perinuclear ER region and it trans-rescues the ankB mutant of strain AA100/130b in intra-vacuolar replication. The di-lysine ER retention motif of AnkB-Paris is indispensable for function; most likely as an ER retention motif that enables anchoring to the ER-derived LCV membrane. Our findings show divergent evolution of the ankB allele in exploiting either host farnesylation or the ER retention motif to be anchored into the LCV membrane.","['Perpich JD', 'Kalia A', 'Price CTD', 'Jones SC', 'Wong K', 'Gehring K', 'Kwaik YA']",2017,7,1,Sci Rep,"Perpich JD, et al.

To understand the epidemiology of LD, we reviewed 15-year longitudinal data from a center in Seattle, Washington that cares for both solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We identified all laboratory-confirmed LD and extracted data on species, diagnostic modalities, clinical presentation, management, and outcomes from medical records. Among 32 patients with LD, transplant recipients made up the majority of diagnoses (22, 69%; SOT 10, HCT 12). Approximately 0.8% of transplant recipients who underwent Legionella-specific testing were positive. Non-pneumophila Legionella species (LNLP), which are not detected by urinary antigen test, accounted for half the cases, led by Legionella micdadei (32%). The severity and outcome between Legionella pneumophila and LNLP infections were similar (attributed mortality, 36% vs 27%); all LNLP deaths occurred in transplant recipients with L. micdadei. The clinical and radiological features mimicked other opportunistic pathogens; 32% (n=7) were not on empiric treatment at the time of diagnosis. These data add to the emerging literature describing the importance of LD and highlight the need for both routine Legionella testing on transplant recipients with pulmonary findings and empiric Legionella-active antibiotic therapy.","['Sivagnanam S', 'Podczervinski S', 'Butler-Wu SM', 'Hawkins V', 'Stednick Z', 'Helbert LA', 'Glover WA', 'Whimbey E', 'Duchin J', 'Cheng GS', 'Pergam SA']",2017,19,5,Transpl Infect Dis,"Sivagnanam S, et al.

(subsp. pneumophila, subsp. fraseri, and subsp. pasculleii), is recognized as the major cause of epidemic legionellosis. Rapid and reliable assays to identify pathogenic Legionella spp., and the three L. pneumophila subsp. in particular, are in great demand. In this study, we analyzed the gyrB genes of eleven Legionella spp. and subsp., comprising L. anisa, L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, L. feeleii, L. gormanii, L. longbeachae, L. micdadei, L. waltersii, L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila, L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri, and L. pneumophila subsp. pasculleii. We developed a rapid oligonucleotide microarray detection technique to identify accurately these common pathogenic Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila subsp. To detect multiple Legionella species with high specificity, 31 reproducible probes were designed in the array. Sixty-one strains were analyzed in total, including 37 target pathogens and 24 non-target bacterial species used to validate the microarray.

28674380,Exceptionally High Creatine Kinase (CK) Levels in Multicausal and Complicated Rhabdomyolysis: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome caused by muscle breakdown. It can be caused by traumatic as well as non-traumatic factors such as drugs, toxins, and infections. Although it has been initially associated with only traumatic causes, non-traumatic causes now appear to be at least 5 times more frequent. In rhabdomyolysis, the CK levels can range anywhere from 10 000 to 200 000 or even higher. The higher the CK levels, the greater will be the renal damage and associated complications. We present the case of a patient with exceptionally massive rhabdomyolysis with unusually high CK levels (nearly 1 million) caused by combined etiologic factors and complicated with acute renal failure. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old African American male patient with no significant past medical history and a social history of cocaine and alcohol abuse presented with diarrhea and generalized weakness of 2 days' duration. He was found to be febrile, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic. The patient was subsequently intubated and admitted to the medical ICU. Laboratory work-up showed acute renal failure with deranged liver functions test results, and elevated creatine kinase of 701,400 U/L. CK levels were subsequently too high for the lab to quantify. Urine legionella testing was positive for L. pneumophilia serogroup 1 antigen and urine toxicology was positive for cocaine. The patient had a protracted course in the ICU. He was initially started on CVVH, and later received intermittent hemodialysis for about 1 month. CONCLUSIONS In the presence of multiple etiologic factors, rhabdomyolysis can be massive with resultant significant morbidity. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for rhabdomyolysis in the presence of multiple factors, as early recognition of this diseases is very important in the prevention and active management of life-threatening conditions.","['Luckoor P', 'Salehi M', 'Kunadu A']",2017,18,,Am J Case Rep,"Luckoor P, et al.

Extensive conventional microbiological testing was applied for all patients. In addition, patients with a serotype-specific pneumococcal antibody response were diagnosed with pneumococcal CAP. Changes in proportions of causative pathogens and distributions of pneumococcal serotypes were calculated.
RESULTS: The proportion of pneumococcal CAP decreased from 37% (n=74/201) to 26% (n=77/300) comparing the pre-PCV7 period with the PCV10 period (p=0.01). For other pathogens, including Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, and respiratory viruses, no sustained shifts were observed in their relative contribution to the aetiology of CAP. Within the pneumococcal CAP patients, we observed a decrease in PCV7 and an increase in non-PCV10 serotype disease. PCV10-extra type disease did not decrease significantly comparing the PCV10 period with the pre-PCV7 and PCV7 period, respectively. Notably, PCV7 type disease decreased both in bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that PCV introduction in infants impact the microbial aetiology of adult CAP and suggest herd effects in adults with CAP after introduction of PCVs in children.","['Vestjens SMT', 'Wagenvoort GHJ', 'Grutters JC', 'Meek B', 'Aldenkamp AF', 'Vlaminckx BJM', 'Bos WJW', 'Rijkers GT', 'van de Garde EMW']",2017,35,33,Vaccine,"Vestjens SMT, et al.

28668392,A novel conformation of the LC3-interacting region motif revealed by the structure of a complex between LC3B and RavZ.,"LC3-family member proteins play a critical role in autophagy, a cellular process responsible for the degradation of massive cellular components including intracellular pathogens. A variety of molecules involved in the autophagic pathway engage in specific interactions with a unique sequence motif referred to as the LIR (LC3-interacting region) motif. Although identification of conserved structural features of LIR motifs in complex with LC3-family members has established a canonical LIR motif, atypical conformations of LIR motifs have recently been revealed. Here, we determined the three-dimensional crystal structures of LC3B in complex with three different LIR motifs of RavZ from Legionella pneumophila, an intracellular pathogen that can manipulate the host autophagy system. The tandem LIR motifs located in the N-terminal region of RavZ adopt a novel β-sheet conformation and thus provide specific ionic interactions with LC3B in addition to canonical hydrophobic plugged-in interactions. Consequently, these motifs possess higher binding affinity to LC3-family members than canonical LIR motifs, although the tandem repeats can only bind to one LC3 molecule. These findings broaden our understanding of the functional repertoire of LIR motifs in autophagy.","['Kwon DH', 'Kim L', 'Kim BW', 'Kim JH', 'Roh KH', 'Choi EJ', 'Song HK']",2017,490,3,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Kwon DH, et al.

28667632,Monitoring Effector Translocation using the TEM-1 Beta-Lactamase Reporter System.,"Among the bacterial secretion systems, the Type III, IV, and VI secretion systems enable bacteria to secrete proteins directly into a target cell. This specific form of secretion, referred to as translocation, is essential for a number of pathogens to alter or kill targeted cells. The translocated proteins, called effector proteins, can directly interfere with the normal processes of the targeted cells, preventing elimination of pathogens and promoting their multiplication. The function of effector proteins varies greatly depending on the considered pathogen and the targeted cell. In addition, there is often no magic bullet, and the number of effector proteins can range from a handful to hundreds, with, for instance, a substrate of over 300 effector proteins of the Icm/Dot Type IV secretion system in the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Identifying, detecting, and monitoring the translocation of each of the effector proteins represents an active field of research and is key to understanding the bacterial molecular weaponry. Translational fusion of an effector with a reporter protein of known activity remains the best method to monitor effector translocation. The development of a fluorescent substrate for the TEM-1 beta-lactamase has turned this antibiotic-resistant protein into a highly versatile reporter system for investigating protein transfer events associated with microbial infection of host cells. Here we describe a simple protocol to assay the translocation of an effector protein by the Icm/Dot system of the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila.","['Allombert J', 'Vianney A', 'Charpentier X']",2017,1615,,Methods Mol Biol,"Allombert J, et al.

28662761,"Genomic investigation of a suspected outbreak of Legionella pneumophila ST82 reveals undetected heterogeneity by the present gold-standard methods, Denmark, July to November 2014.","Between July and November 2014, 15 community-acquired cases of Legionnaires´ disease (LD), including four with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 sequence type (ST) 82, were diagnosed in Northern Zealand, Denmark. An outbreak was suspected. No ST82 isolates were found in environmental samples and no external source was established. Four putative-outbreak ST82 isolates were retrospectively subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) followed by phylogenetic analyses with epidemiologically unrelated ST82 sequences. The four putative-outbreak ST82 sequences fell into two clades, the two clades were separated by ca 1,700 single nt polymorphisms (SNP)s when recombination regions were included but only by 12 to 21 SNPs when these were removed. A single putative-outbreak ST82 isolate sequence segregated in the first clade. The other three clustered in the second clade, where all included sequences had < 5 SNP differences between them. Intriguingly, this clade also comprised epidemiologically unrelated isolate sequences from the UK and Denmark dating back as early as 2011. The study confirms that recombination plays a major role in L. pneumophila evolution. On the other hand, strains belonging to the same ST can have only few SNP differences despite being sampled over both large timespans and geographic distances. These are two important factors to consider in outbreak investigations.","['Schjørring S', 'Stegger M', 'Kjelsø C', 'Lilje B', 'Bangsborg JM', 'Petersen RF', 'David S', 'Uldum SA', 'ESCMID Study Group for Legionella Infections (ESGLI)']",2017,22,25,Euro Surveill,"Schjørring S, et al.

28650958,Dynamics and impact of homologous recombination on the evolution of Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is an environmental bacterium and the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. Previous genomic studies have shown that recombination accounts for a high proportion (>96%) of diversity within several major disease-associated sequence types (STs) of L. pneumophila. This suggests that recombination represents a potentially important force shaping adaptation and virulence. Despite this, little is known about the biological effects of recombination in L. pneumophila, particularly with regards to homologous recombination (whereby genes are replaced with alternative allelic variants). Using newly available population genomic data, we have disentangled events arising from homologous and non-homologous recombination in six major disease-associated STs of L. pneumophila (subsp. pneumophila), and subsequently performed a detailed characterisation of the dynamics and impact of homologous recombination. We identified genomic ""hotspots"" of homologous recombination that include regions containing outer membrane proteins, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) region and Dot/Icm effectors, which provide interesting clues to the selection pressures faced by L. pneumophila. Inference of the origin of the recombined regions showed that isolates have most frequently imported DNA from isolates belonging to their own clade, but also occasionally from other major clades of the same subspecies. This supports the hypothesis that the possibility for horizontal exchange of new adaptations between major clades of the subspecies may have been a critical factor in the recent emergence of several clinically important STs from diverse genomic backgrounds. However, acquisition of recombined regions from another subspecies, L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri, was rarely observed, suggesting the existence of a recombination barrier and/or the possibility of ongoing speciation between the two subspecies. Finally, we suggest that multi-fragment recombination may occur in L. pneumophila, whereby multiple non-contiguous segments that originate from the same molecule of donor DNA are imported into a recipient genome during a single episode of recombination.","['David S', 'Sánchez-Busó L', 'Harris SR', 'Marttinen P', 'Rusniok C', 'Buchrieser C', 'Harrison TG', 'Parkhill J']",2017,13,6,PLoS Genet,"David S, et al.

28639230,Intracellular Pharmacokinetics of Antibacterials and Their Clinical Implications.,"The intracellular pharmacokinetics of the different classes of antimicrobials into surrogate markers of tissue accumulation (alveolar macrophages and/or total alveolar cells collected by means of bronchoalveolar lavage or peripheral white blood cells) was reviewed. The aim of this review was to discuss the clinical implications of the intracellular pharmacokinetics of antibacterials, either from the therapeutic or toxicological perspective. The different pharmacokinetic behaviour of antimicrobials within cells is mainly related to their physicochemical properties (hydrophilicity and lipophilicity), and may have several clinical implications. Therapeutic efficacy against intracellular pathogens has been correlated mainly with the intracellular concentrations achieved by the different antimicrobial agents. This is relevant especially for macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and rifampicin in the treatment of bacterial infections such as Legionella pneumophila pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia, non-gonococcal urethritis and chronic staphylococcal infections. Additionally, intracellular accumulation of antibacterials was correlated with the possibility of causing organ-specific toxicity, as in the case of aminoglycosides in regard to the risk of nephrotoxicity. Finally, it should be kept in mind that intracellular accumulation may also represent a drug reservoir in the case of lipophilic antimicrobials. This may become extremely relevant from the clinical standpoint when treating critically ill patients with sepsis with antibacterials. The pathophysiology of sepsis may explain why it is necessary to start therapy with an increased loading dose of hydrophilic antimicrobials to promptly achieve therapeutically effective concentrations.",['Pea F'],2018,57,2,Clin Pharmacokinet,Pea F.

There is a lack of knowledge concerning the dispersal of airborne microorganisms emitted by composting plants (CP) as well as the potential occupational exposure of composting workers. The aim of this study was to investigate the workers exposure to bioaerosols during working activities in three different types of composting facilities (domestic, manure, carcass) using two different quantification methods (cultivation and qPCR) for bacteria and moulds concentrations. As expected, even if there are differences between all CP frameworks, independently of the type of the raw compost used, the production of bioaerosols increases significantly during handling activities.

28622629,Bacterial community dynamics in a cooling tower with emphasis on pathogenic bacteria and Legionella species using universal and genus-specific deep sequencing.,"Cooling towers are the major source of outbreaks of legionellosis in Europe and worldwide. These outbreaks are mostly associated with Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila, and its surveillance in cooling tower environments is of high relevance to public health. In this study, a combined NGS-based approach was used to study the whole bacterial community, specific waterborne and water-based bacterial pathogens, especially Legionella species, targeting the 16S rRNA gene. This approach was applied to water from a cooling tower obtained by monthly sampling during two years. The studied cooling tower was an open circuit cooling tower with lamellar cooling situated in Braunschweig, Germany. A highly diverse bacterial community was observed with 808 genera including 25 potentially pathogenic taxa using universal 16S rRNA primers. Sphingomonas and Legionella were the most abundant pathogenic genera. By applying genus-specific primers for Legionella, a diverse community with 85 phylotypes, and a representative core community with substantial temporal heterogeneity was observed. A high percentage of sequences (65%) could not be affiliated to an acknowledged species. L. pneumophila was part of the core community and the most abundant Legionella species reinforcing the importance of cooling towers as its environmental reservoir. Major temperature shifts (>10 °C) were the key environmental factor triggering the reduction or dominance of the Legionella species in the Legionella community dynamics. In addition, interventions by chlorine dioxide had a strong impact on the Legionella community composition but not on the whole bacterial community. Overall, the presented results demonstrated the value of a combined NGS approach for the molecular monitoring and surveillance of health related pathogens in man-made freshwater systems.","['Pereira RPA', 'Peplies J', 'Höfle MG', 'Brettar I']",2017,122,,Water Res,"Pereira RPA, et al.

The resistance of two Legionella reference strains (Legionella pneumophila ATCC 33152 and Legionella longbeachae ATCC 33462), three environmental strains [Legionella longbeachae (env.), Legionella norrlandica (env.) and Legionella rowbothamii (env.)] and Acanthamoeba mauritaniensis ATCC 50676 to heat treatment (50-90°C) was determined by monitoring culturability and viability [ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (EMA-qPCR)]. The expression of metabolic and virulence genes of L. pneumophila ATCC 33152 (lolA, sidF, csrA) and L. longbeachae (env.) (lolA) in co-culture with A. mauritaniensis ATCC 50676 during heat treatment (50-90°C) was monitored using relative qPCR. While the culturability (CFU/mL) and viability (gene copies/mL) of the Legionella strains reduced significantly (p < 0.05) following heat treatment (60-90°C), L. longbeachae (env.) and L. pneumophila ATCC 33152 were culturable following heat treatment at 50-60°C. Metabolically active trophozoites and dormant cysts of A. mauritaniensis ATCC 50676 were detected at 50°C and 60-90°C, respectively. For L. pneumophila ATCC 33152, lolA expression remained constant, sidF expression increased and the expression of csrA decreased during co-culture with A. mauritaniensis ATCC 50676. For L. longbeachae (env.), while lolA was up-regulated at 50-70°C, expression was not detected at 80-90°C and in co-culture. In conclusion, while heat treatment may reduce the number of viable Legionella spp. in monoculture, results indicate that the presence of A. mauritaniensis increases the virulence of L. pneumophila during heat treatment. The virulence of Legionella spp. in co-culture with Acanthamoeba spp. should thus be monitored in water distribution systems where temperature (heat) is utilized for treatment.","['Dobrowsky PH', 'Khan S', 'Khan W']",2017,158,,Environ Res,"Dobrowsky PH, et al.

28605194,Discovery of Two Bacterial Nitric Oxide-Responsive Proteins and Their Roles in Bacterial Biofilm Regulation.,"Bacterial biofilms form when bacteria adhere to a surface and produce an exopolysaccharide matrix ( Costerton Science 1999 , 284 , 1318 ; Davies Science 1998 , 280 , 295 ; Flemming Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010 , 8 , 623 ). Because biofilms are resistant to antibiotics, they are problematic in many aspects of human health and welfare, causing, for instance, persistent fouling of medical implants such as catheters and artificial joints ( Brunetto Chimia 2008 , 62 , 249 ). They are responsible for chronic infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and in open wounds, such as those associated with burns and diabetes. They are also a major contributor to hospital-acquired infections ( Sievert Infec. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2013 , 34 , 1 ; Tatterson Front. Biosci. 2001 , 6 , D890 ). It has been hypothesized that effective methods of biofilm control will have widespread application ( Landini Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010 , 86 , 813 ). A promising strategy is to target the mechanisms that drive biofilm dispersal, because dispersal results in biofilm removal and in the restoration of antibiotic sensitivity. First documented in Nitrosomonas europaea ( Schmidt J. Bacteriol. 2004 , 186 , 2781 ) and the cystic fibrosis-associated pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Barraud J. Bacteriol. 2006 , 188 , 7344 ; J. Bacteriol. 2009 , 191 , 7333 ), regulation of biofilm formation by nanomolar levels of the diatomic gas nitric oxide (NO) has now been documented in numerous bacteria ( Barraud Microb. Biotechnol. 2009 , 2 , 370 ; McDougald Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012 , 10 , 39 ; Arora Biochemistry 2015 , 54 , 3717 ; Barraud Curr. Pharm. Des. 2015 , 21 , 31 ). NO-mediated pathways are, therefore, promising candidates for biofilm regulation. Characterization of the NO sensors and NO-regulated signaling pathways should allow for rational manipulation of these pathways for therapeutic applications. Several laboratories, including our own, have shown that a class of NO sensors called H-NOX (heme-nitric oxide or oxygen binding domain) affects biofilm formation by regulating intracellular cyclic di-GMP concentrations and quorum sensing ( Arora Biochemistry 2015 , 54 , 3717 ; Plate Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013 , 38 , 566 ; Nisbett Biochemistry 2016 , 55 , 4873 ). Many bacteria that respond to NO do not encode an hnoX gene, however. My laboratory has now discovered an additional family of bacterial NO sensors, called NosP (nitric oxide sensing protein). Importantly, NosP domains are widely conserved in bacteria, especially Gram-negative bacteria, where they are encoded as fusions with or in close chromosomal proximity to histidine kinases or cyclic di-GMP synthesis or phosphodiesterase enzyme, consistent with signaling. In this Account, we briefly review NO and H-NOX signaling in bacterial biofilms, describe our discovery of the NosP family, and provide support for its role in biofilm regulation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Legionella pneumophila, and Shewanella oneidensis.","['Hossain S', 'Nisbett LM', 'Boon EM']",2017,50,7,Acc Chem Res,"Hossain S, et al.

28600805,"Assessing the impact of a temporary class drug order on ethylphenidate-related infections among people who inject drugs in Lothian, Scotland: an interrupted time-series analysis.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In April 2015, the UK government enacted a temporary class drug order (TCDO) on ethylphenidate in response to reported harms associated with its use, in particular an outbreak of infections among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Lothian, Scotland. This study assesses the effect that the TCDO had on reducing the most common infections identified during the outbreak: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
DESIGN: The outbreak was split into a pre-intervention period (35 weeks) and a post-intervention period (26 weeks) based around the date of the TCDO. Segmented negative binomial regression models were used to compare trends in weekly counts of infections between the pre- and post-intervention periods.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: PWID in the Lothian region of Scotland.
MEASUREMENTS: Cases of S. pyogenes and S. aureus infections reported within the National Health Service, Lothian.
FINDINGS: There were 251 S. pyogenes and/or S. aureus infections recorded among 211 PWID between February 2014 and December 2015: 171 infections in the pre-intervention period and 51 in the post-intervention period. Significant trend changes in weekly S. pyogenes and/or S. aureus infections following the TCDO were found [relative risk (RR) = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-0.94]. PWID who self-reported using novel psychoactive substances (NPS) were at higher risk of acquiring these infections (RR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.12-2.93), particularly when comparing the risk of infection with NPS use for a specific strain, S. pyogenes emm76.0, against the risk of infection with NPS use for S. pyogenes (emm types other than emm76.0) (RR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.32-9.21).

This post-hoc analysis evaluated the effect of addition of a macrolide to ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone treatment in atypical CAP.
METHODS: Two phase 3, double-blind, comparative safety and efficacy studies of ceftaroline fosamil vs. ceftriaxone, FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2, enrolled adults with CAP. Only FOCUS 1 included 24-h adjunctive clarithromycin therapy for all patients on day 1. Day 4 and test-of-cure (TOC) outcomes were compared for adjunctive vs. no adjunctive therapy.
RESULTS: Of 1240 enrolled patients, 130 patients with CAP due to atypical pathogens alone were included (FOCUS 1, n = 64; FOCUS 2, n = 66). Among patients infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or Chlamydophila pneumoniae alone, a higher clinical response rate was observed with clarithromycin plus ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone compared with treatment without additional clarithromycin at day 4 [38/49 (77.6%; FOCUS 1) vs. 24/43 (55.8%; FOCUS 2)], but not at the TOC assessment [42/49 (85.7%; FOCUS 1) vs. 41/43 (95.3%; FOCUS 2)]. In patients infected with Legionella pneumophila alone, a higher clinical response rate with adjunctive clarithromycin therapy was observed at the TOC assessment alone [12/12 (100%; FOCUS 1) vs. 14/19 (73.7%; FOCUS 2)]. The unadjusted odds ratio of a favourable clinical response at day 4 with adjunctive clarithromycin vs. no adjunctive clarithromycin was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1-5.1; P = 0.0299) for all pathogens combined.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that empirical antibiotic therapy against atypical pathogens may improve early clinical response rate. This hypothesis is best evaluated in a prospective trial.","['File TM', 'Eckburg PB', 'Talbot GH', 'Llorens L', 'Friedland HD']",2017,50,2,Int J Antimicrob Agents,"File TM, et al.

We selected 13 pathogens or syndromes implicated in waterborne disease outbreaks or other well-documented waterborne transmission (acute otitis externa, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli (E. coli), free-living ameba, Giardia, Hepatitis A virus, Legionella (Legionnaires' disease), nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Pseudomonas-related pneumonia or septicemia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio). We documented annual numbers of deaths in the United States associated with these infections using a combination of death certificate data, nationally representative hospital discharge data, and disease-specific surveillance systems (2003-2009). We documented 6,939 annual total deaths associated with the 13 infections; of these, 493 (7%) were caused by seven pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route. A total of 6,301 deaths (91%) were associated with infections from Pseudomonas, NTM, and Legionella, environmental pathogens that grow in water system biofilms. Biofilm-associated pathogens can cause illness following inhalation of aerosols or contact with contaminated water. These findings suggest that most mortality from these 13 selected infections in the United States does not result from classical fecal-oral transmission but rather from other transmission routes.","['Gargano JW', 'Adam EA', 'Collier SA', 'Fullerton KE', 'Feinman SJ', 'Beach MJ']",2017,15,3,J Water Health,"Gargano JW, et al.

28598344,Occurrence of Legionella in showers at recreational facilities.,"Critical environments, including water systems in recreational settings, represent an important source of Legionella pneumophila infection in humans. In order to assess the potential risk for legionellosis, we analyzed Legionella contamination of water distribution systems in 36 recreational facilities equipped with swimming pools. One hundred and sixty water samples were analyzed from shower heads or taps located in locker rooms or in bathrooms. By culture method and polymerase chain reaction, 41/160 samples were positive for Legionella from 12/36 recreational centers. Hotels (57.1%) and sports centers (41.2%) were the most contaminated. L. pneumophila serotypes 2-14 (25/41) were more frequently found than serotype 1 (10/41). Samples at temperature ≥30 °C were more frequently positive than samples at temperature <30 °C (n = 39 vs n = 2, p < 0.00001). The presence of L. pneumophila was investigated by comparison with heterotrophic plate count (HPC), an indicator of water quality. The presence of L. pneumophila was associated more frequently with high and intermediate HPC load at 37 °C, therefore should be considered a potential source when HPC at 37 °C is >10 CFU/mL. Maintenance, good hygiene practices, interventions on the hydraulic system and regular controls must be implemented to minimize exposure to L. pneumophila infection risk.","['De Filippis P', 'Mozzetti C', 'Amicosante M', ""D'Alò GL"", 'Messina A', 'Varrenti D', 'Giammattei R', 'Di Giorgio F', 'Corradi S', ""D'Auria A"", 'Fraietta R', 'Gabrieli R']",2017,15,3,J Water Health,"De Filippis P, et al.

28598235,Lift and cut: Anti-host autophagy mechanism of Legionella pneumophila.,"RavZ, an effector protein of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila, inhibits host macroautophagy/autophagy by deconjugation of lipidated LC3 proteins from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the autophagosome membrane. The mechanism for how RavZ specifically recognizes and deconjugates the lipidated LC3s is not clear. To understand the structure-function relationship of LC3-deconjugation by RavZ, we prepared semisynthetic LC3 proteins modified with different fragments of PE or 1-hexadecanol (C16). We find that RavZ activity is strictly dependent on the conjugated PE structure and RavZ extracts LC3-PE from the membrane before deconjugation. Structural and biophysical analysis of RavZ-LC3 interactions suggest that RavZ initially recognizes LC3-PE on the membrane via its N-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. RavZ specifically targets to autophagosome membranes by interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) via its C-terminal domain and association with membranes via the hydrophobic α3 helix. The α3 helix is involved in extraction of the PE moiety and docking of the fatty acid chains into the lipid-binding site of RavZ, which is related in structure to that of the phospholipid transfer protein Sec14. The LIR interaction and lipid binding facilitate subsequent proteolytic cleavage of LC3-PE. The findings reveal a novel mode of host-pathogen interaction.","['Pantoom S', 'Yang A', 'Wu YW']",2017,13,8,Autophagy,"Pantoom S, et al.

The most common mode of transmission of Legionella is inhalation of contaminated aerosols, such as those generated by cooling towers. Simple, rapid and accurate methods to enumerate L. pneumophila are required to prevent the spread of this organism. Here, we applied a microfluidic device for on-chip fluorescent staining and semi-automated counting of L. pneumophila in cooling tower water. We also constructed a portable system for rapid on-site monitoring and used it to enumerate target bacterial cells rapidly flowing in the microchannel. A fluorescently-labelled polyclonal antibody was used for the selective detection of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 in the samples.

In this study, we evaluated the novel lateral flow ImmuView Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila UAT, which detects pneumococcal and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigens in a combined test. We compared the ImmuView UAT with the BinaxNOW S. pneumoniae UAT and the BinaxNOW L. pneumophila UAT in 147 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia (n = 48), non-pneumococcal non-Legionella bacteremia (n = 93) and Legionella infections in the lower airways (L. pneumophila, n = 5; L. bozemanii, n = 1). In three cases, the ImmuView test was invalid before and after boiling while the BinaxNOW tests were valid in all cases. In 144 cases, the three UATs demonstrated a very good inter-assay agreement for detection of pneumococcal antigen (κ = 0.86) and L. pneumophila antigen (κ = 1.00). The ImmuView and BinaxNOW S. pneumoniae tests had similar sensitivities (62% vs 60%; p = ns) in 48 cases with pneumococcal bacteremia and both tests had specificities of 97% in 96 cases with non-pneumococcal infections. Furthermore, the ImmuView and BinaxNOW L. pneumophila tests were positive for Legionella antigen in five patients with confirmed L. pneumophila serogroup 1 infections, and negative in all non-L. pneumophila cases.

28582852,Human Anti-Lipopolysaccharid (LPS) antibodies against Legionella with high species specificity.,"Legionella are Gram-negative bacteria that are ubiquitously present in natural and man-made water reservoirs. When humans inhale aerosolized water contaminated with Legionella, alveolar macrophages can be infected, which may lead to a life-threatening pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. Due to the universal distribution of Legionella in water and their potential threat to human health, the Legionella concentration in water for human use must be strictly monitored, which is difficult since the standard detection still relies on lengthy cultivation and analysis of bacterial morphology. In this study, an antibody against L. pneumophila has been generated from the naïve human HAL antibody libraries by phage-display for the first time. The panning was performed on whole bacterial cells in order to select antibodies that bind specifically to the cell surface of untreated Legionella. The bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was identified as the target structure. Specific binding to the important pathogenic L. pneumophila strains Corby, Philadelphia-1 and Knoxville was observed, while no binding was detected to seven members of the families Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae or Clostridiaceae. Production of this antibody in the recombinant scFv-Fc format using either a murine or a human Fc part allowed the set-up of a sandwich-ELISA for detection of Legionella cells. The scFv-Fc construct proved to be very stable, even when stored for several weeks at elevated temperatures. A sensitivity limit of 4,000 cells was achieved. The scFv-Fc antibody pair was integrated on a biosensor, demonstrating the specific and fast detection of L. pneumophila on a portable device. With this system, 10,000 Legionella cells were detected within 35 min. Combined with a water filtration/concentration system, this antibody may be developed into a promising reagent for rapid on-site Legionella monitoring.","['Kuhn P', 'Thiem S', 'Steinert M', 'Purvis D', 'Lugmayr V', 'Treutlein U', 'Plobner L', 'Leiser RM', 'Hust M', 'Dübel S']",2017,26,1,Hum Antibodies,"Kuhn P, et al.

28571909,The presence of contaminations in sewage sludge - The current situation.,"Sewage sludge/biosolids are by-wastes of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment. As sources of nutrients (C, N, P) they are widely used in intensive farming where large supplementation of organic matter to maintain fertility and enhance crop yields is needed. However, according to the report of European Commission published in 2010, only 39% of produced sewage sludge is recycled into agriculture in the European Union. This situation occurs mainly due to the fact, that the sewage sludge may contain a dangerous volume of different contaminants. For over decades, a great deal of attention has been focused on total concentration of few heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Escherichia coli. The Sewage Sludge Directive (86/278/EEC) regulates the allowable limits of Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg and pathogens and allows for recovery of sludge on land under defined sanitary and environmentally sound conditions. In this paper, a review on quality of sewage sludge based on the publications after 2010 has been presented. Nowadays there are several papers focusing on new serious threats to human health and ecosystem occurring in sewage sludge - both chemicals (such as toxic trace elements - Se, Ag, Ti; nanoparticles; polyaromatic hydrocarbons; polychlorinated biphenyl; perfluorinated surfactants, polycyclic musks, siloxanes, pesticides, phenols, sweeteners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, benzotriazoles) and biological traits (Legionella, Yersinia, Escherichia coli O157:H7).","['Fijalkowski K', 'Rorat A', 'Grobelak A', 'Kacprzak MJ']",2017,203,Pt 3,J Environ Manage,"Fijalkowski K, et al.

28570695,Molecular basis for the binding and modulation of V-ATPase by a bacterial effector protein.,"Intracellular pathogenic bacteria evade the immune response by replicating within host cells. Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' Disease, makes use of numerous effector proteins to construct a niche supportive of its replication within phagocytic cells. The L. pneumophila effector SidK was identified in a screen for proteins that reduce the activity of the proton pumping vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases) when expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. SidK is secreted by L. pneumophila in the early stages of infection and by binding to and inhibiting the V-ATPase, SidK reduces phagosomal acidification and promotes survival of the bacterium inside macrophages. We determined crystal structures of the N-terminal region of SidK at 2.3 Å resolution and used single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of V-ATPase:SidK complexes at ~6.8 Å resolution. SidK is a flexible and elongated protein composed of an α-helical region that interacts with subunit A of the V-ATPase and a second region of unknown function that is flexibly-tethered to the first. SidK binds V-ATPase strongly by interacting via two α-helical bundles at its N terminus with subunit A. In vitro activity assays show that SidK does not inhibit the V-ATPase completely, but reduces its activity by ~40%, consistent with the partial V-ATPase deficiency phenotype its expression causes in yeast. The cryo-EM analysis shows that SidK reduces the flexibility of the A-subunit that is in the 'open' conformation. Fluorescence experiments indicate that SidK binding decreases the affinity of V-ATPase for a fluorescent analogue of ATP. Together, these results reveal the structural basis for the fine-tuning of V-ATPase activity by SidK.","['Zhao J', 'Beyrakhova K', 'Liu Y', 'Alvarez CP', 'Bueler SA', 'Xu L', 'Xu C', 'Boniecki MT', 'Kanelis V', 'Luo ZQ', 'Cygler M', 'Rubinstein JL']",2017,13,6,PLoS Pathog,"Zhao J, et al.

28543850,Structures and kinetics for plant nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases support a domain motion catalytic mechanism.,"Extracellular nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) are enzymes that hydrolyze extracellular nucleotides to the respective monophosphate nucleotides. In the past 20 years, NTPDases belonging to mammalian, parasitic and prokaryotic domains of life have been discovered, cloned and characterized. We reveal the first structures of NTPDases from the legume plant species Trifolium repens (7WC) and Vigna unguiculata subsp. cylindrica (DbLNP). Four crystal structures of 7WC and DbLNP were determined at resolutions between 1.9 and 2.6 Å. For 7WC, structures were determined for an -apo form (1.89 Å) and with the product AMP (2.15 Å) and adenine and phosphate (1.76 Å) bound. For DbLNP, a structure was solved with phosphate and manganese bound (2.60 Å). Thorough kinetic data and analysis is presented. The structure of 7WC and DbLNP reveals that these NTPDases can adopt two conformations depending on the molecule and co-factor bound in the active site. A central hinge region creates a ""butterfly-like"" motion of the domains that reduces the width of the inter-domain active site cleft upon molecule binding. This phenomenon has been previously described in Rattus norvegicus and Legionella pneumophila NTPDaseI and Toxoplasma gondii NTPDaseIII suggesting a common catalytic mechanism across the domains of life.","['Summers EL', 'Cumming MH', 'Oulavallickal T', 'Roberts NJ', 'Arcus VL']",2017,26,8,Protein Sci,"Summers EL, et al.

28531183,A scoping review on bio-aerosols in healthcare and the dental environment.,"BACKGROUND: Bio-aerosols originate from different sources and their potentially pathogenic nature may form a hazard to healthcare workers and patients. So far no extensive review on existing evidence regarding bio-aerosols is available.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to review evidence on bio-aerosols in healthcare and the dental setting. The objectives were 1) What are the sources that generate bio-aerosols?; 2) What is the microbial load and composition of bio-aerosols and how were they measured?; and 3) What is the hazard posed by pathogenic micro-organisms transported via the aerosol route of transmission?
METHODS: Systematic scoping review design. Searched in PubMed and EMBASE from inception to 09-03-2016. References were screened and selected based on abstract and full text according to eligibility criteria. Full text articles were assessed for inclusion and summarized. The results are presented in three separate objectives and summarized for an overview of evidence.
RESULTS: The search yielded 5,823 studies, of which 62 were included. Dental hand pieces were found to generate aerosols in the dental settings. Another 30 sources from human activities, interventions and daily cleaning performances in the hospital also generate aerosols. Fifty-five bacterial species, 45 fungi genera and ten viruses were identified in a hospital setting and 16 bacterial and 23 fungal species in the dental environment. Patients with certain risk factors had a higher chance to acquire Legionella in hospitals. Such infections can lead to irreversible septic shock and death. Only a few studies found that bio-aerosol generating procedures resulted in transmission of infectious diseases or allergic reactions.
CONCLUSION: Bio-aerosols are generated via multiple sources such as different interventions, instruments and human activity. Bio-aerosols compositions reported are heterogeneous in their microbiological composition dependent on the setting and methodology. Legionella species were found to be a bio-aerosol dependent hazard to elderly and patients with respiratory complaints.

28527390,On-filter direct amplification of Legionella pneumophila for rapid assessment of its abundance and viability.,"Guidelines and regulations to control Legionella pneumophila in cooling water systems of large buildings are evolving due to the increasing number of outbreaks. Rapid, on-site, simple, and sensitive quantification methods that are also able to assess viability may be extremely useful in monitoring and control. Culture-based methods for measuring L. pneumophila may take 4-10 days and qPCR-based methods are also slow, requiring at least a day from sample to result, albeit mainly due to the need for sample transport to a centralized laboratory. This study reports a rapid isothermal amplification method for L. pneumophila concentration and detection with live/dead differentiation under field conditions. Using an on-filter direct amplification (i.e., amplification of cells without DNA extraction and purification) approach with propidium monoazide (PMA), and a real time isothermal amplification platform (Gene-Z), L. pneumophila could be detected in 1-2 h at ∼1 cfu/100 ml of tap water.

28515631,Water and air ozone treatment as an alternative sanitizing technology.,"AIMS: We investigated the effectiveness of ozone (aqueous and gaseous) treatment as an alternative sanitizing technology to common conventional disinfectants in reducing the microbial contamination of both water and air.
METHODS: Ozone was added for 20 minutes to a well-defined volume of water and air by the system named ""Ozonomatic
RESULTS: When the ozonisation equipment was located at 30 cm from the surface of the water in the bath tub in which the bacteria investigated were inoculated, the treatment was able to reduce the total microbial load present in the aerosol by 70.4% at a temperature of 36°C for 48 hours. Conversely, at 22°C for 5 days, only a modest decrease (9.1%) was observed. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were completely eliminated. A 93.9% reduction was observed for Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Streptococcus faecalis (25.9%). The addition of ozone to water was able to almost eliminate Staphylococcus aureus (98.9% reduction) and also to exert a strong impact on Legionella pneumophila (87.5% reduction). Streptococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a decrease of 64.2% and 57.4%, respectively. Conversely, only a 26.4% reduction was observed for the bacterium Escherichia coli. This study showed that the addition of ozone in the air exerted a modest reduction on microbial load at 36°C, whereas no effect was observed at 22°C.
CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous and gaseous ozone treatments were effective against microbial contaminants, reducing the CFU of the microorganisms studied. These results confirm the efficacy of the ozone disinfection treatment of both water and air; particularly, it constitutes an extremely promising alternative, allowing the possibility to reuse contaminated water.","['Martinelli M', 'Giovannangeli F', 'Rotunno S', 'Trombetta CM', 'Montomoli E']",2017,58,1,J Prev Med Hyg,"Martinelli M, et al.

In the present study, laboratory scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the inactivation kinetics of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus versicolor, and Penicillium purpurogenum by free chlorine and monochloramine. The observed inactivation data were then fit to a delayed Chick-Watson model. Based on the model parameter estimation, the Ct values (integrated product of disinfectant concentration C and contact time t over defined time intervals) for 99.9% inactivation of the tested fungal strains ranged from 48.99 mg min/L to 194.7 mg min/L for free chlorine and from 90.33 mg min/L to 531.3 mg min/L for monochloramine. Fungal isolates from a drinking water system (Aspergillus versicolor and Penicillium purpurogenum) were more disinfection resistant than Aspergillus fumigatus type and clinical isolates.

METHOD: We culture tested liquefaction-affected soil for Legionella spp. in the six months following the first earthquake in 2010. Thirty silt samples were collected randomly from locations within Christchurch's metropolitan area that were affected by liquefaction. The samples were tested to determine the presence of Legionella using qualitative and quantitative methods. Liquefaction-affected soil samples from three sites were further subjected to particle size distribution analysis and determination of major oxides. A controlled field study was established using six silt samples and one control (commercial compost), seeded with a wild-type strain of Legionella bozemanae serogroup (sg) 1 and persistence monitored over a 60-day period by culturing for the presence of Legionella. Dry matter determinations were undertaken so that total Legionella could be calculated on a dry weight basis.
RESULTS: Legionella bacteria were undetectable after day one in the silt samples. However, L. bozemanae sg1 was detected in the control sample for the entire study period.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the liquefaction-affected soil could not contribute directly to the observed increase in legionellosis cases after the earthquakes due to its inability to support growth and survival of the Legionella bacteria.","['Graham FF', 'Harte DJ']",2017,130,1455,N Z Med J,"Graham FF and Harte DJ.

28479105,Early Radiographic and Tomographic Manifestations of Legionnaires' Disease.,"PURPOSE: Legionnaires' disease (LD) may occur sporadically or in the course of outbreaks, where the typical radiological manifestations of the disease may better be delineated. We took advantage of a rare community-based epidemic of LD (181 patients) that occurred in 2012 in Quebec City, Canada, to describe the radiographic features of LD and compare the its tomographic presentation with that of community-acquired pneumonia caused by common bacteria other than Legionella pneumophila.
METHODS: From the 181 individuals affected in the outbreak, we obtained the chest radiographs of 159 individuals (mean 63 ± 15 years of age) for detailed analysis; 33 patients had a computed tomography (CT) scan performed during the course of their illness. In a case-control study, we compared the CT scans of patients with LD with those of patients who had received a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia caused by a pathogen other than Legionella and confirmed by chest CT scan.
RESULTS: Overall, LD most often presented as an airspace consolidation involving 1 of the lower lobes. Pleural effusion and mediastinal adenopathies were apparent only in a minority, whereas no pneumothorax or cavitation was noted. We did not find any significant difference in chest CT scan findings in patients with LD vs those with community-acquired pneumonia from other bacterial origin. No radiological finding was clearly associated with an increased risk of intensive care unit admission or mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The early radiographic and tomographic manifestations of LD are nonspecific and similar to those found in community-acquired pneumonia from other bacterial origin.","['Poirier R', 'Rodrigue J', 'Villeneuve J', 'Lacasse Y']",2017,68,3,Can Assoc Radiol J,"Poirier R, et al.

28476939,Exploitation of the host cell ubiquitin machinery by microbial effector proteins.,"Pathogenic bacteria are in a constant battle for survival with their host. In order to gain a competitive edge, they employ a variety of sophisticated strategies that allow them to modify conserved host cell processes in ways that favor bacterial survival and growth. Ubiquitylation, the covalent attachment of the small modifier ubiquitin to target proteins, is such a pathway. Ubiquitylation profoundly alters the fate of a myriad of cellular proteins by inducing changes in their stability or function, subcellular localization or interaction with other proteins. Given the importance of ubiquitylation in cell development, protein homeostasis and innate immunity, it is not surprising that this post-translational modification is exploited by a variety of effector proteins from microbial pathogens. Here, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the many ways microbes take advantage of host ubiquitylation, along with some surprising deviations from the canonical theme. The lessons learned from the in-depth analyses of these host-pathogen interactions provide a fresh perspective on an ancient post-translational modification that we thought was well understood.This article is part of a Minifocus on Ubiquitin Regulation and Function.

28463986,The Legionella pneumophila GIG operon responds to gold and copper in planktonic and biofilm cultures.,"Legionella pneumophila contaminates man-made water systems and creates numerous exposure risks for Legionnaires' Disease. Because copper/silver ionization is commonly used to control L. pneumophila, its mechanisms of metal response and detoxification are of significant interest. Here we describe an L. pneumophila operon with significant similarity to the GIG operon of Cupriavidus metallidurans. The Legionella GIG operon is present in a subset of strains and has been acquired as part of the ICE-βox 65-kB integrative conjugative element. We assessed GIG promoter activity following exposure of L. pneumophila to multiple concentrations of HAuCl4, CuSO4 and AgNO3. At 37°C, control stationary phase cultures exhibited GIG promoter activity. This activity increased significantly in response to 20 and 50uM HAuCl4 and CuSO4 but not in response to AgNO3. Conversely, at 26°C, cultures exhibited decreased promoter response to copper. GIG promoter activity was also induced by HAuCl4 or CuSO4 during early biofilm establishment at both temperatures. When an L. pneumophila GIG promoter construct was transformed into E. coli DH5α, cultures showed baseline expression levels that did not increase following metal addition. Analysis of L. pneumophila transcriptional regulatory mutants suggested that GIG up-regulation in the presence of metal ions may be influenced by the stationary phase sigma factor, RpoS.","['Jwanoswki K', 'Wells C', 'Bruce T', 'Rutt J', 'Banks T', 'McNealy TL']",2017,12,5,PLoS One,"Jwanoswki K, et al.

28447136,[Environmental health relevance of airborne microorganisms in ambient and indoor air].,"Airborne microorganisms occur ubiquitously in the ambient air. Besides allergic and irritative-toxic effects, they can cause infections after inhalation. Occupational studies have shown that an increased incidence of respiratory diseases is found in adequately exposed workers. In addition to respiratory diseases, severe systemic infections can also occur in particular cases, such as in the case of a hantavirus infection that is recognized as an occupational disease. In studies from environmental medicine, respiratory diseases have also been observed in residents living in the vicinity of livestock facilities and evaporative cooling towers. In the latter case, an infection risk may be caused by inhalation of legionella-contaminated aerosol from the exhaust air of such systems.Currently, there are no health-related exposure limits for airborne microorganisms released from such facilities. Environmental risk assessment can be carried out on the basis of the guideline VDI 4250 part 1, which relies on an excess of natural background concentration by facility-specific emissions. For the approval practice, the LAI-Leitfaden Bioaerosole is a uniform, standardized method for the determination and assessment of bioaerosol exposure.In indoor spaces, only a few mold types, such as Aspergillus fumigatus are able to trigger infections by local or systemic infection of the human organism. In particular, persons with an immune deficiency or allergies must be informed about the risks of mold exposure in indoor air. In general, mold growth in indoor spaces is a hygienic problem and must not be accepted as a matter of principle.","['Walser SM', 'Brenner B', 'Heinze S', 'Szewzyk R', 'Wolter E', 'Herr CEW']",2017,60,6,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"Walser SM, et al.

28445535,microRNA-125a-3p is regulated by MyD88 in Legionella pneumophila infection and targets NTAN1.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is a causative agent of severe pneumonia. It is highly adapted to intracellular replication and manipulates host cell functions like vesicle trafficking and mRNA translation to its own advantage. However, it is still unknown to what extent microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the Legionella-host cell interaction.
METHODS: WT and MyD88-/- murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were infected with L. pneumophila, the transcriptome was analyzed by high throughput qPCR array (microRNAs) and conventional qPCR (mRNAs), and mRNA-miRNA interaction was validated by luciferase assays with 3´-UTR mutations and western blot.
RESULTS: L. pneumophila infection caused a pro-inflammatory reaction and significant miRNA changes in murine macrophages. In MyD88-/- cells, induction of inflammatory markers, such as Ccxl1/Kc, Il6 and miR-146a-5p was reduced. Induction of miR-125a-3p was completely abrogated in MyD88-/- cells. Target prediction analyses revealed N-terminal asparagine amidase 1 (NTAN1), a factor from the n-end rule pathway, to be a putative target of miR-125a-3p. This interaction could be confirmed by luciferase assay and western blot.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, we characterized the miRNA regulation in L. pneumophila infection with regard to MyD88 signaling and identified NTAN1 as a target of miR-125a-3p. This finding unravels a yet unknown feature of Legionella-host cell interaction, potentially relevant for new treatment options.","['Jentho E', 'Bodden M', 'Schulz C', 'Jung AL', 'Seidel K', 'Schmeck B', 'Bertrams W']",2017,12,4,PLoS One,"Jentho E, et al. microRNA-125a-3p is regulated by MyD88 in Legionella pneumophila infection and targets NTAN1. microRNA-125a-3p is regulated by MyD88 in Legionella pneumophila infection and targets NTAN1. 2017; 12:e0176204. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0176204",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28445535/

Recombinant FLA (rFLA) was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni2+ exchange chromatography. Female BALB/c aged 6-8 weeks were immunized with 20 μg of rFLA. Nonimmunized mice along with mice inoculated with a sublethal dose of live L. pneumophila intravenously were considered as negative and positive controls, respectively. A significant serum antibody response was observed in female BALB/c mice immunized with rFLA. Production of IFN-γ and IL-12, and TNF-α in the serum and the splenocyte cultures, and antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation suggested a strong innate and adaptive cell-mediated immunity response in rFLA-immunized mice. Intravenous lethal challenge with L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (strain Paris) showed that 60% of mice immunized with rFLA survived in a 10-day follow-up survey. These results show that rFLA from L. pneumophila can elicit strong innate and adaptive immune responses and suggest the possibility of a long-term immunity against lethal challenge with L. pneumophila.","['Mohabati Mobarez A', 'Ahmadrajabi R', 'Khoramabadi N', 'Salmanian AH']",2017,27,2,J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol,"Mohabati Mobarez A, et al.

28432021,The ER phagosome connection in the era of membrane contact sites.,"Phagocytosis is an essential mechanism through which innate immune cells ingest foreign material that is either destroyed or used to generate and present antigens and initiate adaptive immune responses. While a role for the ER during phagosome biogenesis has been recognized, whether fusion with ER cisternae or vesicular derivatives occurs has been the source of much contention. Membrane contact sites (MCS) are tight appositions between ER membranes and various organelles that coordinate multiple functions including localized signalling, lipid transfer and trafficking. The discovery that MCS form between the ER and phagosomes now begs the question of whether MCS play a role in connecting the ER to phagosomes under different contexts. In this review, we consider the implications of MCS between the ER and phagosomes during cross-presentation and infection with intracellular pathogens. We also discuss the similarities between these contacts and those between the ER and plasma membrane and acidic organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes.

28420074,Natural Pathogen Control Chemistry to Replace Toxic Treatment of Microbes and Biofilm in Cooling Towers.,"Application of toxic antibacterial agents is considered necessary to control prevalent fresh water microorganisms that grow in evaporative cooling water systems, but can adversely affect the environment and human health. However, natural antibacterial water chemistry has been applied in industrial cooling water systems for over 10 years to inhibit microorganisms with excellent results. The water chemistry method concentrates natural minerals in highly-softened water to produce elevated pH and dissolved solids, while maintaining low calcium and magnesium content. The method provides further benefits in water conservation, and generates a small volume of non-toxic natural salt concentrate for cost efficient separation and disposal if required. This report describes the antimicrobial effects of these chemistry modifications in the cooling water environment and the resultant collective inhibition of microbes, biofilm, and pathogen growth. This article also presents a novel perspective of parasitic microbiome functional relationships, including ""Trojan Protozoans"" and biofilms, and the function of polyvalent metal ions in the formation and inhibition of biofilms. Reducing global dependence on toxic antibacterial agents discharged to the environment is an emerging concern due to their impact on the natural microbiome, plants, animals and humans. Concurrently, scientists have concluded that discharge of antibacterial agents plays a key role in development of pathogen resistance to antimicrobials as well as antibiotics. Use of natural antibacterial chemistry can play a key role in managing the cooling water environment in a more ecologically sustainable manner.","['Brouse L', 'Brouse R', 'Brouse D']",2017,6,2,Pathogens,"Brouse L, et al.

Molecular typing has become an important method for outbreaks investigations and source tracking of Legionnaires. In a survey program conducted by the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, multiple serotypes Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) were isolated from waters in air-conditioning cooling towers in urban Guangzhou region, China between 2008 and 2011. Three genotyping methods, mip (macrophage infectivity potentiator) genotyping, SBT (sequence-based typing), and FAFLP (fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis) were used to type these waterborne L. pneumophila isolates. The three methods were capable of typing all the 134 isolates and a reference strain of L. pneumophila (ATCC33153), with discriminatory indices of 0.7034, 0.9218, and 0.9376, for the mip, SBT, and FAFLP methods respectively. Among the 9 serotypes of the 134 isolates, 10, 50, and 34 molecular types were detected by the mip, SBT, and FAFLP methods respectively. The mip genotyping and SBT typing are more feasible for inter-laboratory results sharing and comparison of different types of L. pneumophila. The SBT and FAFLP typing methods were rapid with higher discriminatory abilities. Combinations of two or more of the typing methods enables more accurate typing of Legionella isolates for outbreak investigations and source tracking of Legionnaires.","['Gong X', 'Li J', 'Zhang Y', 'Hou S', 'Qu P', 'Yang Z', 'Chen S']",2017,139,,J Microbiol Methods,"Gong X, et al.

28393985,[Importance of respiratory virus in immunocompetent adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia].,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a relevant worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality in adult population, however its etiology is often not identified and therapy is empirical.
AIM: To assess the etiology of CAP in immunocompetent adult hospitalized patients using conventional and molecular diagnostic methods.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 240 adult patients who were hospitalized for CAP to identify the microbial etiology. Sputum and blood cultures were obtained as well as serology testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of sixteen respiratory viruses by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: In 100 patients (41.7%) a single respiratory pathogen was identified. In 17 (7.1%) cases, a mixed bacterial and viral infection was detected and no pathogen was identified in 123 cases (51%). The most commonly identified pathogens identified were: influenza virus (15.4%), parainfluenza virus (10.8%), rhinovirus (5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5%), respiratory syncytial virus (2.9%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2.5%). Infectious agent detection by RT-PCR provided greater sensitivity than conventional techniques. Viral respiratory infections were more prevalent in older patients with comorbidities and high risk patients, according to the Fine index at hospital admission. The clinical severity and outcome were independent of the etiological agents detected.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of molecular diagnostic techniques expanded the detection of respiratory viruses in immunocompetent adults hospitalized with CAP.","['Saldías Peñafiel F', 'Ortega Gutiérrez M', 'Fuentes López G', 'Elola Aránguiz JM', 'Uribe Monasterio J', 'Morales Soto A', 'Díaz Patiño O']",2016,144,12,Rev Med Chil,"Saldías Peñafiel F, et al.

Because OPPPs establish and grow as part of the native drinking water microbiota, they do not correspond to fecal indicators, presenting a major challenge to standard drinking water monitoring practices. Further, different OPPPs present distinct requirements for sampling, preservation, and analysis, creating an impediment to their parallel detection. The aim of this critical review is to evaluate the state of the science of monitoring OPPPs and identify a path forward for their parallel detection and quantification in a manner commensurate with the need for reliable data that is informative to risk assessment and mitigation. Water and biofilm sampling procedures, as well as factors influencing sample representativeness and detection sensitivity, are critically evaluated with respect to the five representative bacterial and amoebal OPPPs noted above. Available culturing and molecular approaches are discussed in terms of their advantages, limitations, and applicability.

28384349,Neutrophils and Ly6Chi monocytes collaborate in generating an optimal cytokine response that protects against pulmonary Legionella pneumophila infection.,"Early responses mounted by both tissue-resident and recruited innate immune cells are essential for host defense against bacterial pathogens. In particular, both neutrophils and Ly6Chi monocytes are rapidly recruited to sites of infection. While neutrophils and monocytes produce bactericidal molecules, such as reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, both cell types are also capable of synthesizing overlapping sets of cytokines important for host defense. Whether neutrophils and monocytes perform redundant or non-redundant functions in the generation of anti-microbial cytokine responses remains elusive. Here, we sought to define the contributions of neutrophils and Ly6Chi monocytes to cytokine production and host defense during pulmonary infection with Legionella pneumophila, responsible for the severe pneumonia Legionnaires' disease. We found that both neutrophils and monocytes are critical for host defense against L. pneumophila. Both monocytes and neutrophils contribute to maximal IL-12 and IFNγ responses, and monocytes are also required for TNF production. Moreover, natural killer (NK) cells, NKT cells, and γδ T cells are sources of IFNγ, and monocytes direct IFNγ production by these cell types. Thus, neutrophils and monocytes cooperate in eliciting an optimal cytokine response that promotes effective control of bacterial infection.","['Casson CN', 'Doerner JL', 'Copenhaver AM', 'Ramirez J', 'Holmgren AM', 'Boyer MA', 'Siddarthan IJ', 'Rouhanifard SH', 'Raj A', 'Shin S']",2017,13,4,PLoS Pathog,"Casson CN, et al.

Most global analyses of the innate immune response have focused on transcription induced by defined immunostimulatory ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide. However, the response to pathogens involves additional complexity, as pathogens interfere with virtually every step of gene expression. How cells respond to pathogen-mediated disruption of gene expression to nevertheless initiate protective responses remains unclear. We previously discovered that a pathogen-mediated blockade of host protein synthesis provokes the production of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. It remains unclear how these cytokines are produced despite the global pathogen-induced block of translation.

In many cases, the base-pairing interaction is facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq. However, not all bacteria encode Hfq and some base-pairing sRNAs do not require Hfq raising the possibility of other RNA chaperones. Candidates are proteins with homology to FinO, a factor that promotes base pairing between the FinP antisense sRNA and the traJ mRNA to control F plasmid transfer. Recent papers have shown that the Salmonella enterica FinO-domain protein ProQ binds a large suite of sRNAs, including the RaiZ sRNA, which represses translation of the hupA mRNA, and the Legionella pneumophila protein RocC binds the RocR sRNA, which blocks expression of competence genes. Here we discuss what is known about FinO-domain structures, including the recently solved Escherichia coli ProQ structure, as well as the RNA binding properties of this family of proteins and evidence they act as chaperones. We compare these properties with those of Hfq. We further summarize what is known about the physiological roles of FinO-domain proteins and enumerate outstanding questions whose answers will establish whether they constitute a second major class of RNA chaperones.","['Olejniczak M', 'Storz G']",2017,104,6,Mol Microbiol,Olejniczak M and Storz G.

The protein structures of Mip, PilE and FlaA were analyzed using a computer, and the gene sequences of the dominant epitopes of the three proteins were selected to construct and optimize the vaccine. The optimized mip, pilE, flaA and recombinant mip-pilE-flaA gene sequences were cloned, expressed and purified. The purified proteins were used as dominant epitopes vaccines to immunize BALB/c mice and determine the protective immunity and immunogenicity of these purified proteins. The identification confirmed that the recombinant mip-pilE-flaA was successfully cloned and expressed. ELISA revealed that the Mip-PilE-FlaA group produced the highest IgG response, and this protein may considerably improve the production of some cytokines in BALB/c mice. Histopathology analyses of lungs from mice immunized with Mip-PilE-FlaA revealed a certain protective effect. Our work demonstrated that the recombinant dominant epitopes of Mip-PilE-FlaA exhibited strong immunogenicity and immune protection, and this protein may be an efficient epitopes vaccine candidate against Legionella pneumophila.","['He J', 'Huang F', 'Chen H', 'Chen Q', 'Zhang J', 'Li J', 'Chen D', 'Chen J']",2017,186,,Immunol Lett,"He J, et al.

In this study, bacterial communities were surveyed in water and sediment during a heavy cyanobacterial bloom in a drinking water resource of Lake Taihu, China. A total of 325,317 high-quality sequences were obtained from different 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regions (V3, V4, and V6) using the Miseq sequencing platform. A notable difference was shown between the water and sediment samples, as predominated by Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in the water and Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobia in the sediment, respectively. The LD12 family dominated the water surface and was tightly associated with related indicators of cyanobacterial propagation, indicating involvement in the massive proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms. Alternatively, the genus Nitrospira dominated the sediment samples, which indicates that nitrite oxidation was very active in the sediment. Although pathogenic bacteria were not detected in a large amount, some genera such as Mycobacterium, Acinetobacter, and Legionella were still identified but in very low abundance. In addition, the effects of different V regions on bacterial diversity survey were evaluated. Overall, V4 and V3 were proven to be more promising V regions for bacterial diversity survey in water and sediment samples during heavy water blooms in Lake Taihu, respectively. As longer, cheaper, and faster DNA sequencing technologies become more accessible, we expect that bacterial community structures based on 16S rRNA amplicons as an indicator could be used alongside with physical and chemical indicators, to conduct comprehensive assessments for drinking water resource management.","['Zhang J', 'Zhu C', 'Guan R', 'Xiong Z', 'Zhang W', 'Shi J', 'Sheng Y', 'Zhu B', 'Tu J', 'Ge Q', 'Chen T', 'Lu Z']",2017,24,14,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Zhang J, et al.

28359798,Effect of high-valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on invasive pneumococcal disease in children in SpIDnet countries: an observational multicentre study.,"BACKGROUND: The Streptococcus pneumoniae Invasive Disease network (SpIDnet) actively monitors populations in nine sites in seven European countries for invasive pneumococcal disease. Five sites use 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) alone and four use the ten-valent PCV (PCV10) and PCV13. Vaccination uptake is greater than 90% in six sites and 67-78% in three sites. We measured the effects of introducing high-valency PCVs on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years.
METHODS: We compared the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in each of the 4 years after the introduction of PCV13 alone or PCV10 and PCV13 with the average incidence during the preceding period of heptavalent PCV (PCV7) use, overall and by serotype category. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs for each year and pooled the values for all sites in a random effects meta-analysis.
FINDINGS: 4 years after the introduction of PCV13 alone or PCV10 and PCV13, the pooled IRR was 0·53 (95% CI 0·43-0·65) for invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years caused by any serotype, 0·16 (0·07-0·40) for disease caused by PCV7 serotypes, 0·17 (0·07-0·42) for disease caused by 1, 5, and 7F serotypes, and 0·41 (0·25-0·69) for that caused by 3, 6A and 19A serotypes. We saw a similar pattern when we restricted the analysis to sites where only PCV13 was used. The pooled IRR for invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes was 1·62 (1·09-2·42).
INTERPRETATION: The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by all serotypes decreased due to a decline in the incidence of vaccine serotypes. By contrast, that of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes increased, which suggests serotype replacement. Long-term surveillance will be crucial to monitor the further effects of PCV10 and PCV13 vaccination programmes in young children.

Legionella pneumophila is the aetiological agent of approximately 90% of reported Legionellosis cases, and serogroup 1 is the most frequent cause of infections. Legionnaires' disease is often associated with travel and continues to be a public health concern at present. The correct water management quality practices and rapid methods for analyzing Legionella species in environmental water is a key point for the prevention of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. This study aimed to evaluate the positivity rates and serotyping of Legionella species from water samples in the region of Antalya, Turkey, which is an important tourism center. During January-December 2010, a total of 1403 samples of water that were collected from various hotels (n = 56) located in Antalya were investigated for Legionella pneumophila. All samples were screened for L. pneumophila by culture method according to ""ISO 11731-2"" criteria. The culture positive Legionella strains were serologically identified by latex agglutination test. A total of 142 Legionella pneumophila isolates were recovered from 21 (37.5%) of 56 hotels. The total frequency of L. pneumophila isolation from water samples was found as 10.1%. Serological typing of 142 Legionella isolates by latex agglutination test revealed that strains belonging to L. pneumophila serogroups 2-14 predominated in the examined samples (85%), while strains of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 were less numerous (15%). According to our knowledge, our study with the greatest number of water samples from Turkey demonstrates that L. pneumophila serogroups 2-14 is the most common isolate. Rapid isolation of L. pneumophila from environmental water samples is essential for the investigation of travel related outbreaks and the possible resources.

28317932,Bacterial secretion system skews the fate of Legionella-containing vacuoles towards LC3-associated phagocytosis.,"The evolutionarily conserved processes of endosome-lysosome maturation and macroautophagy are established mechanisms that limit survival of intracellular bacteria. Similarly, another emerging mechanism is LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). Here we report that an intracellular vacuolar pathogen, Legionella dumoffii, is specifically targeted by LAP over classical endocytic maturation and macroautophagy pathways. Upon infection, the majority of L. dumoffii resides in ER-like vacuoles and replicate within this niche, which involves inhibition of classical endosomal maturation. The establishment of the replicative niche requires the bacterial Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS). Intriguingly, the remaining subset of L. dumoffii transiently acquires LC3 to L. dumoffii-containing vacuoles in a Dot/Icm T4SS-dependent manner. The LC3-decorated vacuoles are bound by an apparently undamaged single membrane, and fail to associate with the molecules implicated in selective autophagy, such as ubiquitin or adaptors. The process requires toll-like receptor 2, Rubicon, diacylglycerol signaling and downstream NADPH oxidases, whereas ULK1 kinase is dispensable. Together, we have discovered an intracellular pathogen, the survival of which in infected cells is limited predominantly by LAP. The results suggest that L. dumoffii is a valuable model organism for examining the mechanistic details of LAP, particularly induced by bacterial infection.","['Hubber A', 'Kubori T', 'Coban C', 'Matsuzawa T', 'Ogawa M', 'Kawabata T', 'Yoshimori T', 'Nagai H']",2017,7,,Sci Rep,"Hubber A, et al.

To better understand temporal trends and sources of microbiology delivered to taps, these treatment plants and distribution systems were subjected to source-to-tap sampling over four years. Both plants employ traditional treatment by chloramination, applied during or after settling, followed by filtration before distribution in a warm, low water age system. Longitudinal samples indicated microbiology to have stability both spatially and temporally, and between treatment plants and distribution systems. Disinfection had the greatest impact on microbial composition, which was further refined by filtration and influenced by distribution and premise plumbing. Actinobacteria spp. exhibited trends with treatment. In particular, Mycobacterium spp., very low in finished waters, occurred idiosyncratically at high levels in some tap waters, indicating distribution and/or premise plumbing as main contributors of mycobacteria. Legionella spp., another genus containing potential opportunistic pathogens, also occurred ubiquitously. Source water microbiology was most divergent from tap water, and each step of treatment brought samples more closely similar to tap waters.","['Hull NM', 'Holinger EP', 'Ross KA', 'Robertson CE', 'Harris JK', 'Stevens MJ', 'Pace NR']",2017,51,8,Environ Sci Technol,"Hull NM, et al.

28287548,Legionella pneumophila Outer Membrane Vesicles: Isolation and Analysis of Their Pro-inflammatory Potential on Macrophages.,"Bacteria are able to secrete a variety of molecules via various secretory systems. Besides the secretion of molecules into the extracellular space or directly into another cell, Gram-negative bacteria can also form outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). These membrane vesicles can deliver their cargo over long distances, and the cargo is protected from degradation by proteases and nucleases. Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is an intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen that causes a severe form of pneumonia. In humans, it infects alveolar macrophages, where it blocks lysosomal degradation and forms a specialized replication vacuole. Moreover, L. pneumophila produces OMVs under various growth conditions. To understand the role of OMVs in the infection process of human macrophages, we set up a protocol to purify bacterial membrane vesicles from liquid culture. The method is based on differential ultracentrifugation. The enriched OMVs were subsequently analyzed with regard to their protein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) amount and were then used for the treatment of a human monocytic cell line or murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. The pro-inflammatory responses of those cells were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, alterations in a subsequent infection were analyzed. To this end, the bacterial replication of L. pneumophila in macrophages was studied by colony-forming unit assays. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for the purification of L. pneumophila OMVs from liquid culture by ultracentrifugation and for the downstream analysis of their pro-inflammatory potential on macrophages.","['Jung AL', 'Hoffmann K', 'Herkt CE', 'Schulz C', 'Bertrams W', 'Schmeck B']",2017,,120,J Vis Exp,"Jung AL, et al.

Pb is a known hazard in multiple environmental matrices, exposure from which results in long-term deleterious health effects in humans. This discussion paper aims to provide a succinct account of environmental Pb exposures with a focus on water Pb levels (WLLs) in the United States. It is understood that there is a strong correlation between WLLs and blood Pb levels (BLLs), and the associated health effects. However, within the Flint water crisis, more than water chemistry and Pb exposure occurred. A cascade of regulatory and bureaucratic failures culminated in the Flint water crisis. This paper will discuss pertinent regulations and responses including their limitations after an overview of the public health effects from Pb exposure as well as discussion on our limitations on monitoring and mitigating Pb in tap water. As the Flint water crisis also included increased Legionnares' disease, caused by Legionella pneumophila, this paper will discuss factors influencing L. pneumophila growth. This will highlight the systemic nature of changes to water chemistry and public health impacts.

We aimed to compare the outcomes of current patients with LP treated with levofloxacin, azithromycin and clarithromycin.
METHODS: Observational retrospective multicentre study of consecutive patients with LP requiring hospitalization (2000-2014) conducted in two hospitals. The primary outcome assessed was 30-day mortality. To control for confounding, therapy was assessed by multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: We documented 446 patients with LP, of which 175 were treated with levofloxacin, 177 with azithromycin and 58 with clarithromycin. No significant differences in time to defervescence (2 (interquartile range (IQR) 1-4) versus 2 (IQR 1-3) days; p 0.453), time to achieve clinical stability (3 (2-5) versus 3 (2-5) days; p 0.486), length of intravenous therapy (3 (2-5.25) versus 4 (3-6) days; p 0.058) and length of hospital stay (7 (5-10) versus 6 (5-9) days; p 0.088) were found between patients treated with levofloxacin and those treated with azithromycin. Patients treated with clarithromycin had longer intravenous antibiotic treatment (3 (2-5.25) versus 5 (3-6.25) days; p 0.002) and longer hospital stay (7 (5-10) versus 9 (7-14) days; p 0.043) compared with those treated with levofloxacin. The overall mortality was 4.3% (19 patients). Neither univariate nor multivariate analysis showed a significant association of levofloxacin versus azithromycin on mortality (4 (2.3%) versus 9 (5.1%) deaths; p 0.164). The results did not change after incorporation of the propensity score into the models.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, no significant differences in most outcomes were found between patients treated with levofloxacin and those treated with azithromycin. Due to the small number of deaths, results regarding mortality should be interpreted with caution.","['Garcia-Vidal C', 'Sanchez-Rodriguez I', 'Simonetti AF', 'Burgos J', 'Viasus D', 'Martin MT', 'Falco V', 'Carratalà J']",2017,23,9,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Garcia-Vidal C, et al.

28264171,Role of the LuxR family transcriptional regulator Lpg2524 in the survival of Legionella pneumophila in water.,"The water-borne Gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. Lp is typically transmitted to humans from water systems, where it grows inside amoebae. Survival of Lp in water is central to its transmission to humans. A transcriptomic study previously identified many genes induced by Lp in water. One such gene, lpg2524, encodes a putative LuxR family transcriptional regulator. It was hypothesized that this gene could be involved in the survival of Lp in water. Deletion of lpg2524 does not affect the growth of Lp in rich medium, in the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii, or in human macrophage-like THP-1 cells, showing that Lpg2524 is not required for growth in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, deletion of lpg2524 results in a faster colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in an artificial freshwater medium, Fraquil, indicating that Lpg2524 is important for Lp to survive in water. Overexpression of Lpg2524 also results in a survival defect, suggesting that a precise level of this transcriptional regulator is essential for its function. However, our result shows that Lpg2524 is dispensable for survival in water when Lp is at a high cell density (10","['Li L', 'Faucher SP']",2017,63,6,Can J Microbiol,Li L and Faucher SP.

Effective removal of chemical contaminants and bacterial pathogens from these reservoirs requires an understanding of the bacterial community diversity that is present. In this study, we carried out a 16S rRNA-based profiling approach to describe the bacterial consortia in the raw surface water entering the water treatment plants of 2 rural communities. Our results show that source water is dominated by the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria, with some evidence of seasonal effects altering the predominant groups at each location. A subsequent community analysis of transects of a biological carbon filter in the water treatment plant revealed a significant increase in the proportion of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Nitrospirae relative to raw water. Also, very few enteric coliforms were identified in either the source water or within the filter, although Mycobacterium was of high abundance and was found throughout the filter along with Aeromonas, Legionella, and Pseudomonas. This study provides valuable insight into bacterial community composition within drinking water treatment facilities, and the importance of implementing appropriate disinfection practices to ensure safe potable water for rural communities.","['Zanacic E', 'McMartin DW', 'Stavrinides J']",2017,63,6,Can J Microbiol,"Zanacic E, et al.

28257493,"Seeing red; the development of pON.mCherry, a broad-host range constitutive expression plasmid for Gram-negative bacteria.","The development of plasmid-mediated gene expression control in bacteria revolutionized the field of bacteriology. Many of these expression control systems rely on the addition of small molecules, generally metabolites or non-metabolized analogs thereof, to the growth medium to induce expression of the genes of interest. The paradigmatic example of an expression control system is the lac system from Escherichia coli, which typically relies on the Ptac promoter and the Lac repressor, LacI. In many cases, however, constitutive gene expression is desired, and other experimental approaches require the coordinated control of multiple genes. While multiple systems have been developed for use in E. coli and its close relatives, the utility and/or functionality of these tools does not always translate to other species. For example, for the Gram-negative pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of Legionnaires' Disease, the aforementioned Ptac system represents the only well-established expression control system. In order to enhance the tools available to study bacterial gene expression in L. pneumophila, we developed a plasmid, pON.mCherry, which confers constitutive gene expression from a mutagenized LacI binding site. We demonstrate that pON.mCherry neither interferes with other plasmids harboring an intact LacI-Ptac expression system nor alters the growth of Legionella species during intracellular growth. Furthermore, the broad-host range plasmid backbone of pON.mCherry allows constitutive gene expression in a wide variety of Gram-negative bacterial species, making pON.mCherry a useful tool for the greater research community.","['Gebhardt MJ', 'Jacobson RK', 'Shuman HA']",2017,12,3,PLoS One,"Gebhardt MJ, et al.

A delay in the initiation of specific therapy for LD is associated with increased mortality. The decision to treat a patient for Legionella must be made quickly. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the modified Winthrop-University Hospital WUH system to identify LD while discriminating against pneumococcal pneumonia at the time of hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. Methods Five patients with LD and 13 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed. Results The WUH system identified 4 of 5 patients with LD (sensitivity, 80%) while excluding legionellosis in 12 of 13 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia (specificity, 92%). The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 10.4 and 0.2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.969.

28224696,Can contaminated water be rendered safe for nasal saline irrigations?,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To compare sterile water to three methods of sterilization (carbon filtration, boiling, and ultraviolet [UV] light) for preparation of nasal saline irrigants free of bacterial and amebic contaminants.
STUDY DESIGN: Bench-top translational research and cost comparison.
METHODS: Sterile water was compared to common sterilization methods. Sterile water was contaminated with known concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, and Naegleria fowleri. Test samples were subjected to boiling, carbon filtration, or ultraviolet light (UV) and then cultivated on appropriate media. Controls included samples of sterile water (negative control) and untreated test samples (positive control).
RESULTS: Carbon filtration reduced but did not eliminate the number of organisms present in test samples. Boiling test samples for 5 minutes and UV light treatment resulted in sterilization of all organisms. Negative (sham contaminated) samples produced no growth, whereas positive (untreated) samples grew numerous organisms as expected. A cost comparison between bottled water and UV water sterilization (with SteriPEN Ultra) became equal in less than 2 years of consistent use.
CONCLUSIONS: Carbon filtration reduces contamination but does not sterilize water and is thus unsafe for preparation of nasal saline irrigant. Boiling and UV treatment resulted in sterilization and are equivalent to purchased sterile water. Ultraviolet treatment was found to be safe, convenient, and a cost-effective alternative to purchased sterile water.

28222489,Characterization of a novel signal transducer element intrinsic to class IIIa/b adenylate cyclases and guanylate cyclases.,"Adenylate cyclases (ACs) are signaling proteins that produce the second messenger cAMP. Class III ACs comprise four groups (class IIIa-d) of which class IIIa and IIIb ACs have been identified in bacteria and eukaryotes. Many class IIIa ACs are anchored to membranes via hexahelical domains. In eukaryotic ACs, membrane anchors are well conserved, suggesting that this region possesses important functional characteristics that are as yet unknown. To address this question, we replaced the hexahelical membrane anchor of the mycobacterial AC Rv1625c with the hexahelical quorum-sensing receptor from Legionella, LqsS. Using this chimera, we identified a novel 19-amino-acid cyclase transducer element (CTE) located N-terminally to the catalytic domain that links receptor stimulation to effector activation. Coupling of the receptor to the AC was possible at several positions distal to the membrane exit, resulting in stimulatory or inhibitory responses to the ligand Legionella autoinducer-1. In contrast, on the AC effector side functional coupling was only successful when starting with the CTE. Bioinformatics approaches established that distinct CTEs are widely present in class IIIa and IIIb ACs and in vertebrate guanylate cyclases. The data suggest that membrane-delimited receiver domains transduce regulatory signals to the downstream catalytic domains in an engineered AC model system. This may suggest a previously unknown mechanism for cellular cAMP regulation.","['Ziegler M', 'Bassler J', 'Beltz S', 'Schultz A', 'Lupas AN', 'Schultz JE']",2017,284,8,FEBS J,"Ziegler M, et al.

28213329,Thioaromatic DNA monolayers for target-amplification-free electrochemical sensing of environmental pathogenic bacteria.,"Genosensing technology has mostly based on mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiol-modified oligonucleotides and alkanethiols on gold surfaces. However, the typical backfilling approach, which incorporates the alkanethiol in a second step, gives rise to a heterogeneous distribution of oligonucleotide probes on the surface, negatively affecting to both hybridization efficiency and surface stability. Despite aromatic thiols present a remarkably different behavior from alkanethiols, with higher rigidity and stronger intermolecular interactions, they have been scarcely explored for the fabrication of DNA sensing platforms. We have investigated different approaches involving SAMs of aromatic thiols, namely p-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA) and p-aminothiophenol (p-ATP), to yield DNA sensing layers for sequence-specific detection of target oligonucleotides. The studied monolayers were evaluated by DNA surface coverage and further information was obtained by determining their functionality in a sandwich hybridization assay with enzymatic amplification of the electrochemical read-out. The insertion of thiol-oligonucleotides into p-ATP monolayers previously oxidized, and the covalent binding of amino-oligonucleotides to pure p-MBA monolayers give rise to increased storage stability and better analytical performance. The quantification of RNA from Legionella pneumophila cellular lysates was successfully performed, illustrating the usefulness of these sensing architectures for detecting pathogenic bacteria.","['Miranda-Castro R', 'Sánchez-Salcedo R', 'Suárez-Álvarez B', 'de-Los-Santos-Álvarez N', 'Miranda-Ordieres AJ', 'Jesús Lobo-Castañón M']",2017,92,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Miranda-Castro R, et al.

28212376,The Legionella pneumophila genome evolved to accommodate multiple regulatory mechanisms controlled by the CsrA-system.,"The carbon storage regulator protein CsrA regulates cellular processes post-transcriptionally by binding to target-RNAs altering translation efficiency and/or their stability. Here we identified and analyzed the direct targets of CsrA in the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Genome wide transcriptome, proteome and RNA co-immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing of a wild type and a csrA mutant strain identified 479 RNAs with potential CsrA interaction sites located in the untranslated and/or coding regions of mRNAs or of known non-coding sRNAs. Further analyses revealed that CsrA exhibits a dual regulatory role in virulence as it affects the expression of the regulators FleQ, LqsR, LetE and RpoS but it also directly regulates the timely expression of over 40 Dot/Icm substrates. CsrA controls its own expression and the stringent response through a regulatory feedback loop as evidenced by its binding to RelA-mRNA and links it to quorum sensing and motility. CsrA is a central player in the carbon, amino acid, fatty acid metabolism and energy transfer and directly affects the biosynthesis of cofactors, vitamins and secondary metabolites. We describe the first L. pneumophila riboswitch, a thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitch whose regulatory impact is fine-tuned by CsrA, and identified a unique regulatory mode of CsrA, the active stabilization of RNA anti-terminator conformations inside a coding sequence preventing Rho-dependent termination of the gap operon through transcriptional polarity effects. This allows L. pneumophila to regulate the pentose phosphate pathway and the glycolysis combined or individually although they share genes in a single operon. Thus the L. pneumophila genome has evolved to acclimate at least five different modes of regulation by CsrA giving it a truly unique position in its life cycle.","['Sahr T', 'Rusniok C', 'Impens F', 'Oliva G', 'Sismeiro O', 'Coppée JY', 'Buchrieser C']",2017,13,2,PLoS Genet,"Sahr T, et al.

28203790,Seeding and Establishment of Legionella pneumophila in Hospitals: Implications for Genomic Investigations of Nosocomial Legionnaires' Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease is an important cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia and is caused by infection with the bacterium Legionella. Because current typing methods often fail to resolve the infection source in possible nosocomial cases, we aimed to determine whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could be used to support or refute suspected links between cases and hospitals. We focused on cases involving a major nosocomial-associated strain, L. pneumophila sequence type (ST) 1.
METHODS: WGS data from 229 L. pneumophila ST1 isolates were analyzed, including 99 isolates from the water systems of 17 hospitals and 42 clinical isolates from patients with confirmed or suspected hospital-acquired infections, as well as isolates obtained from or associated with community-acquired sources of Legionnaires' disease.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all hospitals from which multiple isolates were obtained have been colonized by 1 or more distinct ST1 populations. However, deep sampling of 1 hospital also revealed the existence of substantial diversity and ward-specific microevolution within the population. Across all hospitals, suspected links with cases were supported with WGS, although the degree of support was dependent on the depth of environmental sampling and available contextual information. Finally, phylogeographic analysis revealed that hospitals have been seeded with L. pneumophila via both local and international spread of ST1.
CONCLUSIONS: WGS can be used to support or refute suspected links between hospitals and Legionnaires' disease cases. However, deep hospital sampling is frequently required due to the potential coexistence of multiple populations, existence of substantial diversity, and similarity of hospital isolates to local populations.","['David S', 'Afshar B', 'Mentasti M', 'Ginevra C', 'Podglajen I', 'Harris SR', 'Chalker VJ', 'Jarraud S', 'Harrison TG', 'Parkhill J']",2017,64,9,Clin Infect Dis,"David S, et al.

28196833,Characterization of the activation of small GTPases by their GEFs on membranes using artificial membrane tethering.,"Active, GTP-bound small GTPases need to be attached to membranes by post-translational lipid modifications in order to process and propagate information in cells. However, generating and manipulating lipidated GTPases has remained difficult, which has limited our quantitative understanding of their activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and their termination by GTPase-activating proteins. Here, we replaced the lipid modification by a histidine tag in 11 full-length, human small GTPases belonging to the Arf, Rho and Rab families, which allowed to tether them to nickel-lipid-containing membranes and characterize the kinetics of their activation by GEFs. Remarkably, this strategy uncovered large effects of membranes on the efficiency and/or specificity in all systems studied. Notably, it recapitulated the release of autoinhibition of Arf1, Arf3, Arf4, Arf5 and Arf6 GTPases by membranes and revealed that all isoforms are efficiently activated by two GEFs with different regulatory regimes, ARNO and Brag2. It demonstrated that membranes stimulate the GEF activity of Trio toward RhoG by ∼30 fold and Rac1 by ∼10 fold, and uncovered a previously unknown broader specificity toward RhoA and Cdc42 that was undetectable in solution. Finally, it demonstrated that the exceptional affinity of the bacterial RabGEF DrrA for the phosphoinositide PI(4)P delimits the activation of Rab1 to the immediate vicinity of the membrane-bound GEF. Our study thus validates the histidine-tag strategy as a potent and simple means to mimic small GTPase lipidation, which opens a variety of applications to uncover regulations brought about by membranes.","['Peurois F', 'Veyron S', 'Ferrandez Y', 'Ladid I', 'Benabdi S', 'Zeghouf M', 'Peyroche G', 'Cherfils J']",2017,474,7,Biochem J,"Peurois F, et al.

In addition, we analyzed the genetic diversity among Legionella pneumophila isolates from shower water as well as the genetic relationship between isolates from shower water and from stock strains previously analyzed from sputum specimens.
METHODS: The isolates were characterized using serogrouping, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and sequence-based typing.
RESULTS: Legionella spp. were isolated from 31/91 (34.1%) samples derived from 17/37 (45.9%) bath facilities. Isolates from shower water and bath water in each public bath facility were serologically or genetically different, indicating that we need to isolate several L. pneumophila colonies from both bath and shower water to identify public bath facilities as sources of legionellosis. The 61 L. pneumophila isolates from shower water were classified into 39 sequence types (STs) (index of discrimination = 0.974), including 19 new STs.

A complete and organized set of flagellar genes was found for P. salmonis, although no structural flagellum has ever been reported for this bacterium. To gain further understanding, the hierarchical flagellar cascade described for Legionella pneumophila was used as a reference model for putative analysis in P. salmonis. Specifically, 5 of the most relevant genes from this cascade were chosen, including 3 regulatory genes (fleQ, triggers the cascade; fliA, regulates the σ28-coding gene; and rpoN, an RNA polymerase-dependent gene) and 2 terminal structural genes (flaA and flaB, flagellin and a flagellin-like protein, respectively). Kinetic experiments evaluated gene expressions over time, with P. salmonis assessed in 2 liquid, cell-free media and during infection of the SHK-1 fish cell line. Under all conditions, the 5 target genes were primarily expressed during early growth/infection and were differentially expressed when bacteria encountered environmental stress (i.e. a high-salt concentration). Intriguingly, the flagellin monomer was fully expressed under all growth conditions and was located near the bacterial membrane. While no structural flagellum was detected under any condition, the recombinant flagellin monomer induced a proinflammatory response in SHK-1 cells, suggesting a possible immunomodulatory function. The potential implications of these observations are discussed in the context of P. salmonis biology and pathogenic potential.","['Carril GP', 'Gómez FA', 'Marshall SH']",2017,123,1,Dis Aquat Organ,"Carril GP, et al.

From June 2013 to November 2014, we collected 138 water and 90 swab samples from aquatic environments in 19 houses. Legionella DNA was detected via a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay in 66 (47·8%) water and 17 (18·9%) swab samples. High Legionella DNA detection rates were observed in water samples from washing machines and aquariums. Legionella spp. was isolated from 9 (6·5%) water and 3 (3·3%) swab samples. Legionella pneumophila SG 1 was detected from the outlet water of a bathtub spout and a bath sponge. Use of amoebic co-culture effectively increased legionellae and Legionella DNA detection rates from all sample types. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the heterotrophic plate count was significantly related to Legionella contamination. Our findings indicate that there is a risk of legionellosis from exposure to Legionella spp. in a variety of aquatic environments in residential houses.

The nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene was amplified using bacterial primer in the first step. After, the amplicons were employed as DNA templates in the second PCR using Legionella specific primer. The third round of gene amplification was conducted to gain PCR fragments apposite for DGGE analysis. Then the total numbers of amplified genes were observed in DGGE bands of products gained with primers specific for the diversity of Legionella species. The DGGE patterns are thus potential for a high-throughput preliminary determination of aquatic environmental Legionella species before sequencing. Comparative DNA sequence analysis of excised DGGE unique band patterns showed the identity of the Legionella community members, including a reference profile with two pathogenic species of Legionella strains. In addition, only members of Legionella pneumophila and uncultured Legionella sp. were detected. Development of three step nested PCR-DGGE tactic is seen as a useful method for studying the diversity of Legionella community. The method is rapid and provided sequence information for phylogenetic analysis.","['Huang WC', 'Tsai HC', 'Tao CW', 'Chen JS', 'Shih YJ', 'Kao PM', 'Huang TY', 'Hsu BM']",2017,12,2,PLoS One,"Huang WC, et al.

28159178,Legionnaire's Disease: A Clinical Diagnostic Approach.,"Legionnaire's disease is a nonzoonotic atypical pneumonia caused by Legionella sp that occurs sporadically or in outbreaks. Legionnaire's disease pneumonia is accompanied by several extrapulmonary clinical and laboratory findings. Rather than testing all pneumonias for Legionnaire's disease, the clinical challenge is to recognize the diagnostic significance of Legionnaire's disease's. The pretest probability of Legionnaire's disease is increased if several characteristic extrapulmonary findings are present. Similarly, if certain key findings are absent, Legionnaire's disease may be eliminated from further diagnostic consideration. If characteristic clinical findings are present, then specific tests should be ordered to confirm or rule out Legionnaire's disease.","['Cunha BA', 'Cunha CB']",2017,31,1,Infect Dis Clin North Am,Cunha BA and Cunha CB.

Depending on geographic location, season, and physician awareness, Legionnaire's disease may be included in the differential diagnosis of CAP. Some antibiotics effective against Legionella sp are also effective in treating the typical bacterial causes of CAP. From an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) perspective, monotherapy is preferred to double-drug therapy.

Copathogenesis between pandemic influenza and bacteria is characterized by complex interactions between coinfecting pathogens and the host. Understanding the underlying reason of the emersion of the secondary bacterial infection during an influenza infection is challenging.

28155809,From Evolutionary Advantage to Disease Agents: Forensic Reevaluation of Host-Microbe Interactions and Pathogenicity.,"As the ""human microbiome era"" continues, there is an increasing awareness of our resident microbiota and its indispensable role in our fitness as holobionts. However, the host-microbe relationship is not so clearly defined for some human symbionts. Here we discuss examples of ""accidental pathogens,"" meaning previously nonpathogenic and/or environmental microbes thought to have inadvertently experienced an evolutionary shift toward pathogenicity. For instance, symbionts such as Helicobacter pylori and JC polyomavirus have been shown to have accompanied humans since prehistoric times and are still abundant in extant populations as part of the microbiome. And yet, the relationship between a subgroup of these microbes and their human hosts seems to have changed with time, and they have recently gained notoriety as gastrointestinal and neuropathogens, respectively. On the other hand, environmental microbes such as Legionella spp. have recently experienced a shift in host range and are now a major problem in industrialized countries as a result of artificial ecosystems. Other variables involved in this accidental phenomenon could be the apparent change or reduction in the diversity of human-associated microbiota because of modern medicine and lifestyles.

We investigated a large outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in New York City in summer 2015 to characterize patients, risk factors for mortality, and environmental exposures.
METHODS: We defined cases as patients with pneumonia and laboratory evidence of Legionella infection from July 2 through August 3, 2015, and with a history of residing in or visiting 1 of several South Bronx neighborhoods of New York City. We describe the epidemiologic, environmental, and laboratory investigation that identified the source of the outbreak.
RESULTS: We identified 138 patients with outbreak-related Legionnaires' disease, 16 of whom died. The median age of patients was 55. A total of 107 patients had a chronic health condition, including 43 with diabetes, 40 with alcoholism, and 24 with HIV infection. We tested 55 cooling towers for Legionella, and 2 had a strain indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis from 26 patient isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and epidemiologic evidence implicated 1 cooling tower as the source of the outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: A large outbreak of Legionnaires' disease caused by a cooling tower occurred in a medically vulnerable community.

We therefore studied the proteome of isolates of these different molecular types in search of the proteins responsible for infection. In this study, we performed a differential proteomic analysis between patient-related and non-patient-related environmental isolates using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with mass spectrometry. Sixty-three spots were observed as being different between the two groups; 31 spots were identified corresponding to 23 different proteins. Patient-related isolates overexpressed proteins associated with metabolism, with enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the degradation pathways being the most abundant proteins identified. However, the largest group of non-patient-related proteins was associated with stress response. Furthermore, the MOMP protein was located in different spots depending on their patient-related or non-patient-related origin, suggesting different post-translational modifications. According to these results, different bacterial adaptation pathways are activated in stress conditions which influence their ability to produce infection.","['Quero S', 'García-Núñez M', 'Párraga-Niño N', 'Pedro-Botet ML', 'Mateu L', 'Sabrià M']",2017,74,3,Curr Microbiol,"Quero S, et al.

28137939,Macrolide resistance in Legionella pneumophila: the role of LpeAB efflux pump.,"OBJECTIVES: A previous study on 12 in vitro -selected azithromycin-resistant Legionella pneumophila lineages showed that ribosomal mutations were major macrolide resistance determinants. In addition to these mechanisms that have been well described in many species, mutations upstream of lpeAB operon, homologous to acrAB in Escherichia coli , were identified in two lineages. In this study, we investigated the role of LpeAB and of these mutations in macrolide resistance of L. pneumophila .
METHODS: The role of LpeAB was studied by testing the antibiotic susceptibility of WT, deleted and complemented L. pneumophila Paris strains. Translational fusion experiments using GFP as a reporter were conducted to investigate the consequences of the mutations observed in the upstream sequence of lpeAB operon.
RESULTS: We demonstrated the involvement of LpeAB in an efflux pump responsible for a macrolide-specific reduced susceptibility of L. pneumophila Paris strain. Mutations in the upstream sequence of lpeAB operon were associated with an increased protein expression. Increased expression was also observed under sub-inhibitory macrolide concentrations in strains with both mutated and WT promoting regions.
CONCLUSIONS: LpeAB are components of an efflux pump, which is a macrolide resistance determinant in L. pneumophila Paris strain. Mutations observed in the upstream sequence of lpeAB operon in resistant lineages led to an overexpression of this efflux pump. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of macrolides themselves participated in upregulating this efflux and could constitute a first step in the acquisition of a high macrolide resistance level.","['Massip C', 'Descours G', 'Ginevra C', 'Doublet P', 'Jarraud S', 'Gilbert C']",2017,72,5,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Massip C, et al.

28129393,A Legionella Effector Disrupts Host Cytoskeletal Structure by Cleaving Actin.,"Legionella pneumophila, the etiological agent of Legionnaires' disease, replicates intracellularly in protozoan and human hosts. Successful colonization and replication of this pathogen in host cells requires the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system, which translocates approximately 300 effector proteins into the host cell to modulate various cellular processes. In this study, we identified RavK as a Dot/Icm substrate that targets the host cytoskeleton and reduces actin filament abundance in mammalian cells upon ectopic expression. RavK harbors an H95EXXH99 motif associated with diverse metalloproteases, which is essential for the inhibition of yeast growth and for the induction of cell rounding in HEK293T cells. We demonstrate that the actin protein itself is the cellular target of RavK and that this effector cleaves actin at a site between residues Thr351 and Phe352. Importantly, RavK-mediated actin cleavage also occurs during L. pneumophila infection. Cleavage by RavK abolishes the ability of actin to form polymers. Furthermore, an F352A mutation renders actin resistant to RavK-mediated cleavage; expression of the mutant in mammalian cells suppresses the cell rounding phenotype caused by RavK, further establishing that actin is the physiological substrate of RavK. Thus, L. pneumophila exploits components of the host cytoskeleton by multiple effectors with distinct mechanisms, highlighting the importance of modulating cellular processes governed by the actin cytoskeleton in the intracellular life cycle of this pathogen.","['Liu Y', 'Zhu W', 'Tan Y', 'Nakayasu ES', 'Staiger CJ', 'Luo ZQ']",2017,13,1,PLoS Pathog,"Liu Y, et al.

METHODS: The authors obtained demographic characteristics and dental practice behaviors from participants in the annual American Dental Association Health Screening Program survey administered from 2002 through 2012. The authors assayed serum samples obtained from participants for L pneumophila antibodies. The authors used an adjusted logit model to evaluate predictors of positive results.
RESULTS: Among 5,431 participants, approximately 10% were positive for L pneumophila, with no significant differences between dental practitioners and nonpractitioners. Geographic location was the only significant predictor of seropositivity, with no increased risk of being exposed to L pneumophila associated with age, race, sex, years in practice, hours of practice per week, use of barrier protection, or infection control practices.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of L pneumophila antibodies was 10.4% among dental and nondental personnel. US Census division was the only significant predictor of seropositivity. The authors conclude that provision of dental care did not increase the risk of being exposed to Legionella.

28124966,[A case of bronchiolitis obliterans secondary to human metapneumovirus bronchiolitis].,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), formerly classified in Paramyxoviridae family is now moved into Pneumoviridae, which was described as a novel family. It causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) usually in children younger than five years old. The recent epidemiological studies indicated that hMPV is the second most frequently detected virus in LRTIs of young children, following the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a chronic obstructive lung disease characterized by fibrosis of the distal respiratory airways. It is usually a result of an inflammatory process triggered by a LRTI related to adenovirus, RSV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, measles virus, Legionella pneumophila, influenza virus or Bordetella pertussis as a causative agent. In this report, a case of hMPV bronchiolitis complicated with BO has been reported to point out the complications and severity of the clinical progress belongs to this virus. A three-month-old female patient has admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit with the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis and respiratory failure. She was born at term, weighing 2950 gram and had been hospitalized in newborn intensive care unit for 11 days with the diagnosis of transient tachypnea of the newborn and neonatal sepsis. On auscultation, there were bilateral crepitant rales, wheezing and prolonged expirium. Her oxygen saturation was 97-98% while respiratory support was given with a non-rebreathing reservoir mask. Complete blood count, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels were in normal ranges. The chest radiography yielded right middle lobe atalectasia, left paracardiac infiltration and bilateral air trapping. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was analyzed by a commercial multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific®, USA) developed for the detection of 15 respiratory viruses. Her sample yielded positive result for only hMPV. On the 4th day of hospitalization, the patient was intubated because of respiratory failure and carbon dioxide retention. She was extubated on the 19th day but could not tolerate. In the thorax computed tomography (CT), bilateral hyperinflation, patchy infiltration, mosaic perfusion and atelectasis especially bilateral posterior areas were detected. Bronchoscopy was normal except mild bronchomalacia in right middle lobe bronchus. The patient was diagnosed as BO secondary to hMPV bronchiolitis, according to the clinical, virological, bronchoscopic and thorax CT results. On the 76th day of admission, she was discharged with respiratory support with home ventilation via a tracheostomy cannula and medical treatments of oral metilprednisolone, nebulized salbutamol and budesonide.

28123918,Severe Legionella Pneumophila Infection in an Immunocompetent Patient: A Success Story 300 Kilometers Away.,"The most significant outbreak of Legionella pneumophila, or Legionnaires' Disease, ever registered in Portugal occurred in 2014, and was considered one of the largest in European history. This relatively rare infection has a dire prognosis if not timely identified and correctly treated, presenting with a high lethality rate. We describe a case of infection by Legionella pneumophila in a previously healthy individual during an outbreak that originated 300 kilometers away from our hospital. The patient presented to the Emergency Department and after an initial assessment, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He underwent supportive treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation and antibiotic therapy, having been discharged with functional improvement 21 days after admission. During follow-up, the patient presented well without residual clinical or radiological findings. Prompt management following established guidelines allowed for the appropriate treatment and a favorable prognosis. This case serves as a reminder that early management is important, healthy individuals without known risk factors may present with severe infection, and there is the possibility for individual cases of Legionellosis to present far from the outbreak source.","['Jacob M', 'Ramos HC', 'Morgado B']",2016,8,12,Cureus,"Jacob M, et al.

28117485,Evaluation of a most probable number method for the enumeration of Legionella pneumophila from potable and related water samples.,"UNLABELLED: This study compared the performance of a novel MPN method (Legiolert/Quanti-Tray) with the ISO 11731-2 membrane filtration method for the enumeration of Legionella pneumophila from 100 ml potable water and related samples. Data from a multi-laboratory study analysed according to ISO 17994 showed that Legiolert™/Quanti-Tray® yielded on average higher counts of L. pneumophila. The Legiolert medium had a high specificity of 96·4%. The new method represents a significant improvement in the enumeration of L. pneumophila from drinking water-related samples.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Legionella pneumophila is an opportunistic pathogen of major concern. The current large volume quantitative method employs membrane filtration (MF) and selective culture on GVPC agar followed by confirmation of isolates by serology (ISO 11731-2) We present here the results of a multi-laboratory evaluation of a most probable number (MPN) in-situ confirmed method (Legiolert™/Quanti-Tray®). The results indicate that Legiolert/Quanti-Tray yielded on average higher counts of L. pneumophila than ISO 11731-2.

28103814,The respiratory microbiome in bronchial mucosa and secretions from severe IgE-mediated asthma patients.,"BACKGROUND: The bronchial microbiome in chronic lung diseases presents an abnormal pattern, but its microbial composition and regional differences in severe asthma have not been sufficiently addressed. The aim of the study was to describe the bacterial community in bronchial mucosa and secretions of patients with severe chronic asthma chronically treated with corticosteroids in addition to usual care according to Global Initiative for Asthma. Bacterial community composition was obtained by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing, and functional capabilities through PICRUSt.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients with severe asthma were included and provided 11 bronchial biopsies (BB) and 12 bronchial aspirates (BA) suitable for sequence analyses. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria showed relative abundances (RAs) over 5% in BB, a cutoff that was reached by Streptococcus and Prevotella at genus level. Legionella genus attained a median RA of 2.7 (interquartile range 1.1-4.7) in BB samples. In BA a higher RA of Fusobacteria was found, when compared with BB [8.7 (5.9-11.4) vs 4.2 (0.8-7.5), p = 0.037], while the RA of Proteobacteria was lower in BA [4.3 (3.7-6.5) vs 17.1 (11.2-33.4), p = 0.005]. RA of the Legionella genus was also significantly lower in BA [0.004 (0.001-0.02) vs. 2.7 (1.1-4.7), p = 0.005].

28097816,Effect of temperature and colonization of Legionella pneumophila and Vermamoeba vermiformis on bacterial community composition of copper drinking water biofilms.,"It is unclear how the water-based pathogen, Legionella pneumophila (Lp), and associated free-living amoeba (FLA) hosts change or are changed by the microbial composition of drinking water (DW) biofilm communities. Thus, this study characterized the bacterial community structure over a 7-month period within mature (> 600-day-old) copper DW biofilms in reactors simulating premise plumbing and assessed the impact of temperature and introduction of Lp and its FLA host, Vermamoeba vermiformis (Vv), co-cultures (LpVv). Sequence and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses indicated a correlation between LpVv introduction and increases in Legionella spp. levels at room temperature (RT), while at 37°C, Lp became the dominant Legionella spp. qPCR analysis suggested Vv presence may not be directly associated with Lp biofilm growth at RT and 37°C, but may contribute to or be associated with non-Lp legionellae persistence at RT. Two-way PERMANOVA and PCoA revealed that temperature was a major driver of microbiome diversity. Biofilm community composition also changed over the seven-month period and could be associated with significant shifts in dissolved oxygen, alkalinity and various metals in the influent DW. Hence, temperature, biofilm age, DW quality and transient intrusions/amplification of pathogens and FLA hosts may significantly impact biofilm microbiomes and modulate pathogen levels over extended periods.","['Buse HY', 'Ji P', 'Gomez-Alvarez V', 'Pruden A', 'Edwards MA', 'Ashbolt NJ']",2017,10,4,Microb Biotechnol,"Buse HY, et al.

28093834,Seasonality of pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Seasonal distribution of microbial aetiology in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may add important information both for epidemiologists and clinicians. We investigate the seasonal distribution of microbial aetiology in CAP.
METHODS: This prospective observational study was carried out in the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain (January 2003-December 2014).
RESULTS: We studied 4431 patients with CAP, of whom 2689 (61%) were males. Microbial aetiology was identified in 1756 patients (40%). CAP was most frequent in winter (34%) but two-third of patients with CAP presented in other seasons. Seasonal variations included Streptococcus pneumoniae (winter 21% vs spring 17% vs summer 14% vs autumn 13%, overall P < 0.001). Influenza viruses were most prevalent in autumn (6%) and winter (5%) compared with spring (3%) and summer (1%) (overall P < 0.001). Legionella pneumophila was most frequent in autumn (4%) and summer (4%) compared with spring (2%) and winter (1%) (overall P < 0.001). Incidence of polymicrobial pneumonia also differed between seasons (winter 7% vs spring 5% vs summer 3% vs autumn 6%, overall P = 0.001). We observed a significant correlation between the lowest seasonal average temperature and polymicrobial pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia, and influenza viruses; conversely, L. pneumophila was more common when temperatures were higher.
CONCLUSION: CAP should not be regarded as a seasonal disease but occurs throughout all seasons. However, S. pneumoniae, influenza viruses, polymicrobial pneumonia and L. pneumophila are clearly subject to seasonal variations.","['Cilloniz C', 'Ewig S', 'Gabarrus A', 'Ferrer M', 'Puig de la Bella Casa J', 'Mensa J', 'Torres A']",2017,22,4,Respirology,"Cilloniz C, et al.

28085931,Broad-Range Detection of Microorganisms Directly from Bronchoalveolar Lavage Specimens by PCR/Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry.,"The clinical demand on rapid microbiological diagnostic is constantly increasing. PCR coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, PCR/ESI-MS, offers detection and identification of over 750 bacteria and Candida species directly from clinical specimens within 6 hours. In this study, we investigated the clinical performance of the IRIDICA BAC LRT Assay for detection of bacterial pathogens in 121 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples that were received consecutively at our bacterial laboratory for BAL culture. Commensal or pathogenic microorganisms were detected in 118/121 (98%) BAL samples by PCR/ESI-MS, while in 104/121 (86%) samples by routine culture (P<0.01). Detection of potentially pathogenic microorganisms by PCR/ESI-MS was evaluated in comparison with conventional culture-based or molecular methods. The agreement between positive findings was overall good. Most Staphylococcus aureus-positive PCR/ESI-MS results were confirmed by culture or species-specific PCR (27/33, 82%). The identity of Streptococcus pneumoniae could however be confirmed for only 6/17 (35%) PCR/ESI-MS-positive samples. Non-cultivable and fastidious pathogens, which were not covered by standard culture procedures were readily detected by PCR/ESI-MS, including Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella pertussis, Norcadia species and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In conclusion, PCR/ESI-MS detected a broad range of potential pathogens with equal or superior sensitivity compared to conventional methods within few hours directly from BAL samples. This novel method might thus provide a relevant tool for diagnostics in critically ill patients.","['Ullberg M', 'Lüthje P', 'Mölling P', 'Strålin K', 'Özenci V']",2017,12,1,PLoS One,"Ullberg M, et al.

28085262,"Effect of Disinfectant Exposure on Legionella pneumophila Associated with Simulated Drinking Water Biofilms: Release, Inactivation, and Infectivity.","Legionella pneumophila, the most commonly identified causative agent in drinking water associated with disease outbreaks, can be harbored by and released from drinking water biofilms. In this study, the release of biofilm-associated L. pneumophila under simulated drinking water flow containing a disinfectant residual was examined. Meanwhile, the inactivation and infectivity (to amoebae) of the released L. pneumophila were studied. To simulate drinking water system conditions, biofilms were prepared under either disinfectant exposure (predisinfected biofilms) or disinfectant-free (untreated biofilms) conditions, respectively. For experiments with water flow containing a disinfectant to release the biofilm-associated L. pneumophila from these two types of biofilms, the L. pneumophila release kinetics values from predisinfected and untreated biofilms under flow condition were not statistically different (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). However, inactivation of the L. pneumophila released from predisinfected biofilms was 1-2 times higher and amoeba infectivity was 2-29 times lower than that from untreated biofilms. The higher disinfectant resistance of L. pneumophila released from untreated biofilms was presumably influenced by the detachment of a larger amount of biofilm material (determined by 16S rRNA qPCR) surrounding the released L. pneumophila. This study highlights the interaction among disinfectant residual, biofilms, and L. pneumophila, which provides guidelines to assess and control pathogen risk.","['Shen Y', 'Huang C', 'Lin J', 'Wu W', 'Ashbolt NJ', 'Liu WT', 'Nguyen TH']",2017,51,4,Environ Sci Technol,"Shen Y, et al.

28082190,A bioinformatics tool for ensuring the backwards compatibility of Legionella pneumophila typing in the genomic era.,"OBJECTIVES: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the subtyping of Legionella pneumophila but calling the traditional sequence-based type from genomic data is hampered by multiple copies of the mompS locus. We propose a novel bioinformatics solution for rectifying that limitation, ensuring the feasibility of WGS for cluster investigation.
METHODS: We designed a novel approach based on the alignment of raw reads with a reference sequence. With WGS, reads originating from either of the two mompS copies cannot be differentiated. Therefore, when non-identical copies were present, we applied a read-filtering strategy based on read alignment to a reference sequence via unique 'anchors'. If minimal read coverage was achieved after filtration (≥3X), a consensus sequence was built based on mapped reads followed by calling the sequence-based typing allele. The entire procedure was implemented using a Perl script.
RESULTS: The method was validated using a diverse sample of 265 L. pneumophila genomes, consisting of 59 different sequence types (STs) and 23 mompS variants; 57 of the 265 (22%) had non-identical mompS copies. In 237 of the 265 samples (89.4%), mompS calling was successful and no erroneous calling occurred. A 98.1% success was recorded among 109 samples meeting quality requirements. The method was superior to alternative approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: As WGS becomes more accessible, technical difficulties in routine clinical and surveillance work will arise. The case of mompS in L. pneumophila serves as an example for such limitations that necessitate the development of novel computational solutions that meet end-user demands.","['Gordon M', 'Yakunin E', 'Valinsky L', 'Chalifa-Caspi V', 'Moran-Gilad J', 'ESCMID Study Group for Legionella Infections']",2017,23,5,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Gordon M, et al.

28073586,Experimental comparison of point-of-use filters for drinking water ultrafiltration.,"BACKGROUND: Waterborne pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. and Legionella spp. may persist in hospital water networks despite chemical disinfection. Point-of-use filtration represents a physical control measure that can be applied in high-risk areas to contain the exposure to such pathogens. New technologies have enabled an extension of filters' lifetimes and have made available faucet hollow-fibre filters for water ultrafiltration.
AIM: To compare point-of-use filters applied to cold water within their period of validity.
METHODS: Faucet hollow-fibre filters (filter A), shower hollow-fibre filters (filter B) and faucet membrane filters (filter C) were contaminated in two different sets of tests with standard bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 939 and Brevundimonas diminuta ATCC 19146) and installed at points-of-use. Every day, from each faucet, 100 L of water was flushed. Before and after flushing, 250 mL of water was collected and analysed for microbiology.
FINDINGS: There was a high capacity of microbial retention from filter C; filter B released only low Brevundimonas spp. counts; filter A showed poor retention of both micro-organisms.
CONCLUSION: Hollow-fibre filters did not show good micro-organism retention. All point-of-use filters require an appropriate maintenance of structural parameters to ensure their efficiency.","['Totaro M', 'Valentini P', 'Casini B', 'Miccoli M', 'Costa AL', 'Baggiani A']",2017,96,2,J Hosp Infect,"Totaro M, et al.

Here we analyze and compare the bacterial microbiome of sputum samples from pneumonia patients in relation to the presence and abundance of the genus Legionella. The prevalence of Legionella species was determined by culture, PCR, and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Nine sputum samples out of the 133 analyzed were PCR-positive using Legionella genus-specific primers. Only one sample was positive by culture. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses of Legionella-positive and Legionella-negative sputum samples, confirmed that indeed, Legionella was present in the PCR-positive sputum samples. This approach allowed the identification of the sputum microbiome at the genus level, and for Legionella genus at the species and sub-species level. 42% of the sputum samples were dominated by Streptococcus. Legionella was never the dominating genus and was always accompanied by other respiratory pathogens. Interestingly, sputum samples that were Legionella positive were inhabited by aquatic bacteria that have been observed in an association with amoeba, indicating that amoeba might have transferred Legionella from the drinking water together with its microbiome. This is the first study that demonstrates the sputum major bacterial commensals and pathogens profiles with regard to Legionella presence.","['Mizrahi H', 'Peretz A', 'Lesnik R', 'Aizenberg-Gershtein Y', 'Rodríguez-Martínez S', 'Sharaby Y', 'Pastukh N', 'Brettar I', 'Höfle MG', 'Halpern M']",2017,7,,Sci Rep,"Mizrahi H, et al.

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus spp. were enumerated using culture-based methods. All tank water samples over the six events were positive for at least one OPPP (Legionella spp., Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare, Pseudmonas aeruginosa, or Acanthamoeba spp.) during the entire course of the study. FIB were positively but weakly correlated with P. aeruginosa (E. coli vs P. aeruginosa τ = 0.090, p = 0.027; Enterococcus spp. vs P. aeruginosa τ = 0.126, p = 0.002), but not the other OPPPs. FIBs were more prevalent during the wet season than the dry season, and L. pneumophila was only observed during the wet season. However, concentrations of Legionella spp., M. intracellulare, Acanthamoeba spp., and M. avium peaked during the dry season. Correlations were assessed between FIB and OPPPs with meteorological variables, and it was determined that P. aeruginosa was the only OPPP positively associated with an increased antecedent dry period, suggesting stagnation time may play a role for the occurrence of this OPPP in tank water. Infection risks may exceed commonly cited benchmarks for uses reported in the rainwater usage survey such as pool top-up, and warrant further exploration through quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA).","['Hamilton KA', 'Ahmed W', 'Palmer A', 'Smith K', 'Toze S', 'Haas CN']",2017,51,3,Environ Sci Technol,"Hamilton KA, et al.

In addition, 68% of isolates from serogroup 1, the main cause of legionellosis, possessed all three virulence genes compared with 40% of isolates from serogroups 2 to 15. Prevalence of isolates with two genes was 5-14% and 6-29% in serogroup 1 and serogroups 2 to 15, respectively, whereas that of isolates with one gene was 1-2% and 0-6%, respectively. These results provide valuable information for epidemiological investigations of the relationship between environmental and clinical isolates in legionellosis outbreaks in Busan.","['Hwang IY', 'Park EH', 'Lee YC']",2017,48,1,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,"Hwang IY, et al.

29536361,Subversion of Host Membrane Dynamics by the Legionella Dot/Icm Type IV Secretion System.,"Legionella species are Gram-negative ubiquitous environmental bacteria, which thrive in biofilms and parasitize protozoa. Employing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, the opportunistic pathogens also replicate intracellularly in mammalian macrophages. This feature is a prerequisite for the pathogenicity of Legionella pneumophila, which causes the vast majority of clinical cases of a severe pneumonia, termed ""Legionnaires' disease."" In macrophages as well as in amoeba, L. pneumophila grows in a distinct membrane-bound compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). Formation of this replication-permissive pathogen compartment requires the bacterial Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS). Through the T4SS as many as 300 different ""effector"" proteins are injected into host cells, where they presumably subvert pivotal processes. Less than 40 Dot/Icm substrates have been characterized in detail to date, a number of which show unprecedented biological activities. Some of these effector proteins target host cell small GTPases, phosphoinositide lipids, the chelator phytate, the ubiquitination machinery, the retromer complex, the actin cytoskeleton, or the autophagy pathway. A recently discovered class of L. pneumophila effectors modulates the activity of other effectors and is termed ""metaeffectors."" Here, we summarize recent insight into the cellular functions and biochemical activities of L. pneumophila effectors and metaeffectors targeting the host's endocytic, retrograde, or autophagic pathways.","['Hilbi H', 'Nagai H', 'Kubori T', 'Roy CR']",2017,413,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Hilbi H, et al.

29536354,Structural and Molecular Biology of Type IV Secretion Systems.,"Type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are nanomachines that Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteria, and some archaea use to transport macromolecules across their membranes into bacterial or eukaryotic host targets or into the extracellular milieu. They are the most versatile secretion systems, being able to deliver both proteins and nucleoprotein complexes into targeted cells. By mediating conjugation and/or competence, T4SSs play important roles in determining bacterial genome plasticity and diversity; they also play a pivotal role in the spread of antibiotic resistance within bacterial populations. T4SSs are also used by human pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella pertussis, Brucella sp., or Helicobacter pylori to sustain infection. Since they are essential virulence factors for these important pathogens, T4SSs might represent attractive targets for vaccines and therapeutics. The best-characterized conjugative T4SSs of Gram-negative bacteria are composed of twelve components that are conserved across many T4SSs. In this chapter, we will review our current structural knowledge on the T4SSs by describing the structures of the individual components and how they assemble into large macromolecular assemblies. With the combined efforts of X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and more recently electron microscopy, structural biology of the T4SS has made spectacular progress during the past fifteen years and has unraveled the properties of unique proteins and complexes that assemble dynamically in a highly sophisticated manner.","['Bergé C', 'Waksman G', 'Terradot L']",2017,413,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Bergé C, et al.

29536353,Biological Diversity and Evolution of Type IV Secretion Systems.,"The bacterial type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are a highly functionally and structurally diverse superfamily of secretion systems found in many species of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. Collectively, the T4SSs can translocate DNA and monomeric and multimeric protein substrates to a variety of bacterial and eukaryotic cell types. Detailed phylogenomics analyses have established that the T4SSs evolved from ancient conjugation machines whose original functions were to disseminate mobile DNA elements within and between bacterial species. How members of the T4SS superfamily evolved to recognize and translocate specific substrate repertoires to prokaryotic or eukaryotic target cells is a fascinating question from evolutionary, biological, and structural perspectives. In this chapter, we will summarize recent findings that have shaped our current view of the biological diversity of the T4SSs. We focus mainly on two subtypes, designated as the types IVA (T4ASS) and IVB (T4BSS) systems that respectively are represented by the paradigmatic Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 and Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm T4SSs. We present current information about the composition and architectures of these representative systems. We also describe how these and a few related T4ASS and T4BSS members evolved as specialized nanomachines through acquisition of novel domains or subunits, a process that ultimately generated extensive genetic and structural mosaicism among this secretion superfamily. Finally, we present new phylogenomics information establishing that the T4BSSs are much more broadly distributed than initially envisioned.","['Christie PJ', 'Gomez Valero L', 'Buchrieser C']",2017,413,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Christie PJ, et al.

28032346,Mannose-binding lectin and l-ficolin polymorphisms in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by intracellular pathogens.,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading infectious disease requiring hospitalization in the western world. Genetic variability affecting the host response to infection may play a role in susceptibility and outcome in patients with CAP. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and l-ficolin (l-FCN) are two important activators of the complement system and they can enhance phagocytosis by opsonization. In a prospective cohort of 505 Dutch patients with CAP and 227 control participants we studied whether polymorphisms in the MBL (MBL2) and FCN (FCN2) genes influenced susceptibility and outcome. No difference in frequency of these genotypes was found between patients with CAP in general and controls. However, the +6424G>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FCN2 was more common in patients with a Coxiella burnetii pneumonia (P = 0·014). Moreover, the haplotypes coding for the highest MBL serum levels (YA/YA and YA/XA) predisposed to atypical pneumonia (C. burnetii, Legionella or Chlamydia species or Mycoplasma pneumoniae) compared with controls (P = 0·016). Furthermore, patients with these haplotypes were more often bacteraemic (P = 0·019). It can therefore be concluded that MBL2 and FCN2 polymorphisms are not major risk factors for CAP in general, but that the +6424G>T SNP in the FCN2 gene predisposes to C. burnetii pneumonia. In addition, patients with genotypes corresponding with high serum MBL levels are at risk for atypical pneumonia, possibly caused by enhanced phagocytosis, thereby promoting cell entry of these intracellular bacteria.","['van Kempen G', 'Meijvis S', 'Endeman H', 'Vlaminckx B', 'Meek B', 'de Jong B', 'Rijkers G', 'Bos WJ']",2017,151,1,Immunology,"van Kempen G, et al.

28026026,MAMs are attractive targets for bacterial repurposing of the host cell: MAM-functions might be key for undermining an infected cell.,"Pathogenic bacteria frequently target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in order to exploit host functions. ER-mitochondria inter-organelle communication is topologically sub-compartmentalized at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). MAMs are specific membranous microdomains with unique regulatory functions such as lipid synthesis and trafficking, calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial morphology, inflammasome activation, autophagosome formation, and apoptosis. These important cellular processes are all modulated by pathogens to subvert host functions and promote infection, thus it is tempting to assume that pathogenic bacteria target MAMs to subvert these different pathways in their hosts. First lines of evidence that support this hypothesis come from Legionella pneumophila. This intracellular bacterium secretes an effector that exhibits sphingosine-1 phosphate lyase activity (LpSpl) that seems to target MAMs to modulate the autophagy response to infection. Here we thus propose the concept that MAMs could be targeted by pathogenic bacteria to undermine key host cellular processes.","['Escoll P', 'Rolando M', 'Buchrieser C']",2017,39,2,Bioessays,"Escoll P, et al.

28001372,Biochemical Validation of a Third Guanidine Riboswitch Class in Bacteria.,"Recently, it was determined that representatives of the riboswitch candidates called ykkC and mini-ykkC directly bind free guanidine. These riboswitches regulate the expression of genes whose protein products are implicated in overcoming the toxic effects of this ligand. Thus, the relevant ykkC motif and mini-ykkC motif RNAs have been classified as guanidine-I and guanidine-II riboswitch RNAs, respectively. Moreover, we had previously noted that a third candidate riboswitch class, called ykkC-III, was associated with a distribution of genes similar to those of the other two motifs. Therefore, it was predicted that ykkC-III motif RNAs would sense and respond to the same ligand. In this report, we present biochemical data supporting the hypothesis that ykkC-III RNAs represent a third class of guanidine-sensing RNAs called guanidine-III riboswitches. Members of the guanidine-III riboswitch class bind their ligand with an affinity similar to that observed for members of the other two classes. Notably, there are some sequence similarities between guanidine-II and guanidine-III riboswitches. However, the characteristics of ligand discrimination by guanidine-III RNAs are different from those of the other guanidine-binding motifs, suggesting that the binding pockets have distinct features among the three riboswitch classes.","['Sherlock ME', 'Breaker RR']",2017,56,2,Biochemistry,Sherlock ME and Breaker RR.

The patient was previously started on steroids due to the suspicion of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) in the context of Goodpasture syndrome. However, clinical and laboratory findings did not support this diagnosis; instead a careful evaluation limited differential diagnosis of the renal insult to acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) following respiratory infection. With lung function fully improved but renal function not recovering, a renal biopsy revealed AIN, a finding leading to further diagnostic testing and finally to the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease as a cause of this patient's pulmonary-renal syndrome.

27973535,The Influence of Programmed Cell Death in Myeloid Cells on Host Resilience to Infection with Legionella pneumophila or Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Pathogen clearance and host resilience/tolerance to infection are both important factors in surviving an infection. Cells of the myeloid lineage play important roles in both of these processes. Neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells all have important roles in initiation of the immune response and clearance of bacterial pathogens. If these cells are not properly regulated they can result in excessive inflammation and immunopathology leading to decreased host resilience. Programmed cell death (PCD) is one possible mechanism that myeloid cells may use to prevent excessive inflammation. Myeloid cell subsets play roles in tissue repair, immune response resolution, and maintenance of homeostasis, so excessive PCD may also influence host resilience in this way. In addition, myeloid cell death is one mechanism used to control pathogen replication and dissemination. Many of these functions for PCD have been well defined in vitro, but the role in vivo is less well understood. We created a mouse that constitutively expresses the pro-survival B-cell lymphoma (bcl)-2 protein in myeloid cells (CD68(bcl2tg), thus decreasing PCD specifically in myeloid cells. Using this mouse model we explored the impact that decreased cell death of these cells has on infection with two different bacterial pathogens, Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pyogenes. Both of these pathogens target multiple cell death pathways in myeloid cells, and the expression of bcl2 resulted in decreased PCD after infection. We examined both pathogen clearance and host resilience and found that myeloid cell death was crucial for host resilience. Surprisingly, the decreased myeloid PCD had minimal impact on pathogen clearance. These data indicate that the most important role of PCD during infection with these bacteria is to minimize inflammation and increase host resilience, not to aid in the clearance or prevent the spread of the pathogen.","['Gamradt P', 'Xu Y', 'Gratz N', 'Duncan K', 'Kobzik L', 'Högler S', 'Kovarik P', 'Decker T', 'Jamieson AM']",2016,12,12,PLoS Pathog,"Gamradt P, et al.

27964907,Occurrence of Legionella in UK household showers.,"Household water systems have been proposed as a source of sporadic, community acquired Legionnaires' disease. Showers represent a frequently used aerosol generating device in the domestic setting yet little is known about the occurrence of Legionella spp. in these systems. This study has investigated the prevalence of Legionella spp. by culture and qPCR in UK household showers. Ninety nine showers from 82 separate properties in the South of England were sampled. Clinically relevant Legionella spp. were isolated by culture in 8% of shower water samples representing 6% of households. Legionella pneumophila sg1 ST59 was isolated from two showers in one property and air sampling demonstrated its presence in the aerosol state. A further 31% of showers were positive by Legionella spp. qPCR. By multi-variable binomial regression modelling Legionella spp. qPCR positivity was associated with the age of the property (p=0.02), the age of the shower (p=0.01) and the frequency of use (p=0.09). The concentration of Legionella spp. detected by qPCR was shown to decrease with increased frequency of use (p=0.04) and more frequent showerhead cleaning (p=0.05). There was no association between Legionella spp. qPCR positivity and the cold water supply or the showerhead material (p=0.65 and p=0.71, respectively). Household showers may be important reservoirs of clinically significant Legionella and should be considered in source investigations. Simple public health advice may help to mitigate the risk of Legionella exposure in the domestic shower environment.","['Collins S', 'Stevenson D', 'Bennett A', 'Walker J']",2017,220,2 Pt B,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Collins S, et al.

27942021,MTOR-Driven Metabolic Reprogramming Regulates Legionella pneumophila Intracellular Niche Homeostasis.,"Vacuolar bacterial pathogens are sheltered within unique membrane-bound organelles that expand over time to support bacterial replication. These compartments sequester bacterial molecules away from host cytosolic immunosurveillance pathways that induce antimicrobial responses. The mechanisms by which the human pulmonary pathogen Legionella pneumophila maintains niche homeostasis are poorly understood. We uncovered that the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) required a sustained supply of host lipids during expansion. Lipids shortage resulted in LCV rupture and initiation of a host cell death response, whereas excess of host lipids increased LCVs size and housing capacity. We found that lipids uptake from serum and de novo lipogenesis are distinct redundant supply mechanisms for membrane biogenesis in Legionella-infected macrophages. During infection, the metabolic checkpoint kinase Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (MTOR) controlled lipogenesis through the Serum Response Element Binding Protein 1 and 2 (SREBP1/2) transcription factors. In Legionella-infected macrophages a host-driven response that required the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) adaptor protein Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) dampened MTOR signaling which in turn destabilized LCVs under serum starvation. Inactivation of the host MTOR-suppression pathway revealed that L. pneumophila sustained MTOR signaling throughout its intracellular infection cycle by a process that required the upstream regulator Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and one or more Dot/Icm effector proteins. Legionella-sustained MTOR signaling facilitated LCV expansion and inhibition of the PI3K-MTOR-SREPB1/2 axis through pharmacological or genetic interference or by activation of the host MTOR-suppression response destabilized expanding LCVs, which in turn triggered cell death of infected macrophages. Our work identified a host metabolic requirement for LCV homeostasis and demonstrated that L. pneumophila has evolved to manipulate MTOR-dependent lipogenesis for optimal intracellular replication.","['Abshire CF', 'Dragoi AM', 'Roy CR', 'Ivanov SS']",2016,12,12,PLoS Pathog,"Abshire CF, et al.

27938342,Comparative analysis of solar pasteurization versus solar disinfection for the treatment of harvested rainwater.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous pathogens and opportunistic pathogens have been detected in harvested rainwater. Developing countries, in particular, require time- and cost-effective treatment strategies to improve the quality of this water source. The primary aim of the current study was thus to compare solar pasteurization (SOPAS; 70 to 79 °C; 80 to 89 °C; and ≥90 °C) to solar disinfection (SODIS; 6 and 8 hrs) for their efficiency in reducing the level of microbial contamination in harvested rainwater. The chemical quality (anions and cations) of the SOPAS and SODIS treated and untreated rainwater samples were also monitored.
RESULTS: While the anion concentrations in all the samples were within drinking water guidelines, the concentrations of lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni) exceeded the guidelines in all the SOPAS samples. Additionally, the iron (Fe) concentrations in both the SODIS 6 and 8 hr samples were above the drinking water guidelines. A >99% reduction in Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria counts was then obtained in the SOPAS and SODIS samples. Ethidium monoazide bromide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (EMA-qPCR) analysis revealed a 94.70% reduction in viable Legionella copy numbers in the SOPAS samples, while SODIS after 6 and 8 hrs yielded a 50.60% and 75.22% decrease, respectively. Similarly, a 99.61% reduction in viable Pseudomonas copy numbers was observed after SOPAS treatment, while SODIS after 6 and 8 hrs yielded a 47.27% and 58.31% decrease, respectively.
CONCLUSION: While both the SOPAS and SODIS systems reduced the indicator counts to below the detection limit, EMA-qPCR analysis indicated that SOPAS treatment yielded a 2- and 3-log reduction in viable Legionella and Pseudomonas copy numbers, respectively. Additionally, SODIS after 8 hrs yielded a 2-log and 1-log reduction in Legionella and Pseudomonas copy numbers, respectively and could be considered as an alternative, cost-effective treatment method for harvested rainwater.","['Strauss A', 'Dobrowsky PH', 'Ndlovu T', 'Reyneke B', 'Khan W']",2016,16,1,BMC Microbiol,"Strauss A, et al.

Since early and accurate therapy reduces mortality, rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed. A total of 134 samples of blood, urine and respiratory tract fluids were collected. Blood was tested for IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies using commercially available kits. A total of 8 (6%) samples were found to be positive for L. pneumophila by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), compared to conventional PCR where 6 (4.4%) samples were positive. Serology was positive in a total of 32 (23%) cases though only 3 (2.2%) of the PCR-positive cases were positive by serology as well. These results suggest that real-time PCR can detect Legionella infection early in the course of the disease before serological response develops.","['Angrup A', 'Chaudhry R', 'Sharma S', 'Valavane A', 'Passi K', 'Padmaja K', 'Javed S', 'Dey AB', 'Dhawan B', 'Kabra SK']",2016,34,4,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Angrup A, et al.

27932612,Legionella longbeachae Is Immunologically Silent and Highly Virulent In Vivo.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella longbeachae (Llo) and Legionella pneumophila (Lpn) are the most common pneumonia-causing agents of the genus. Although both species can be lethal to humans and are highly prevalent, little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of Llo infections. In murine models of infection, Lpn infection is self-limited, whereas Llo infection is lethal.
METHODS: We used mouse macrophages, human macrophages, human epithelial cells, and mouse infections in vivo to evaluate multiple parameters of the infection.
RESULTS: We determined that the Llo Dot/Icm secretion system is critical for virulence. Different than Lpn, Llo disseminates and the animals develop a severe pulmonary failure, as demonstrated by lung mechanics and blood oxygenation assays. As compared to Lpn, Llo is immunologically silent and fails to trigger the production of cytokines in human pulmonary epithelial cells and in mouse and human macrophages. Infections in Tnfr1-/-, Ifng-/-, and Il12p40-/- mice supported the participation of cytokines for the resistance phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Both Lpn and Llo require the Dot/Icm system for pathogenesis, but the infection outcome is strikingly different. Llo is immunologically silent, highly virulent, and lethal. The differences reported herein may reflect unappreciated clinical differences in patients infected with Lpn or Llo.","['Massis LM', 'Assis-Marques MA', 'Castanheira FV', 'Capobianco YJ', 'Balestra AC', 'Escoll P', 'Wood RE', 'Manin GZ', 'Correa VM', 'Alves-Filho JC', 'Cunha FQ', 'Buchrieser C', 'Borges MC', 'Newton HJ', 'Zamboni DS']",2017,215,3,J Infect Dis,"Massis LM, et al.

27929353,Enhanced survival but not amplification of Francisella spp. in the presence of free-living amoebae.,"Transmission of Francisella tularensis, the etiologic agent of tularemia, has been associated with various water sources. Survival of many waterborne pathogens within free-living amoeba (FLA) is well documented; however, the role of amoebae in the environmental persistence of F. tularensis is unclear. In this study, axenic FLA cultures of Acanthamoeba castellanii, Acanthamoeba polyphaga, and Vermamoeba vermiformis were each inoculated with virulent strains of F. tularensis (Types A and B), the attenuated live vaccine strain, and Francisella novicida. Experimental parameters included low and high multiplicity of infection and incubation temperatures of 25 and 30 °C for 0-10 days. Francisella spp. survival was enhanced by the presence of FLA; however, bacterial growth and protozoa infectivity were not observed. In contrast, co-infections of A. polyphaga and Legionella pneumophila, used as an amoeba pathogen control, resulted in bacterial proliferation, cytopathic effects, and amoebal lysis. Collectively, even though short-term incubation with FLA was beneficial, the long-term effects on Francisella survival are unknown, especially given the expenditure of available amoebal derived nutrients and the fastidious nature of Francisella spp. These factors have clear implications for the role of FLA in Francisella environmental persistence.","['Buse HY', 'Schaefer FW', 'Rice EW']",2017,64,1,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung,"Buse HY, et al.

By day 2 bacterial counts on the outlet-water showed that contamination of the system had occurred. After 14 days, a biofilm comparable to that of clinical waterlines, consisting of bacteria, fungi and amoebae had formed. This showed that the proprietary silver coating applied to the luminal surface of the commercial waterline tubing failed to prevent biofilm formation. Molecular barcoding of isolated culturable microorganisms showed some degree of the diversity of taxa in the biofilm, including the opportunistic pathogen Legionella pneumophila.

27919312,Lessons From an Outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease on a Hematology-Oncology Unit.,"OBJECTIVES To define the scope of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (LD), to identify the source, and to stop transmission. DESIGN AND SETTING Epidemiologic investigation of an LD outbreak among patients and a visitor exposed to a newly constructed hematology-oncology unit. METHODS An LD case was defined as radiographically confirmed pneumonia in a person with positive urinary antigen testing and/or respiratory culture for Legionella and exposure to the hematology-oncology unit after February 20, 2014. Cases were classified as definitely or probably healthcare-associated based on whether they were exposed to the unit for all or part of the incubation period (2-10 days). We conducted an environmental assessment and collected water samples for culture. Clinical and environmental isolates were compared by monoclonal antibody (MAb) and sequence-based typing. RESULTS Over a 12-week period, 10 cases were identified, including 6 definite and 4 probable cases. Environmental sampling revealed Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) in the potable water at 9 of 10 unit sites (90%), including all patient rooms tested. The 3 clinical isolates were identical to environmental isolates from the unit (MAb2-positive, sequence type ST36). No cases occurred with exposure after the implementation of water restrictions followed by point-of-use filters. CONCLUSIONS Contamination of the unit's potable water system with Lp1 strain ST36 was the likely source of this outbreak. Healthcare providers should routinely test patients who develop pneumonia at least 2 days after hospital admission for LD. A single case of LD that is definitely healthcare associated should prompt a full investigation.

27912065,Phosphoribosylation of Ubiquitin Promotes Serine Ubiquitination and Impairs Conventional Ubiquitination.,"Conventional ubiquitination involves the ATP-dependent formation of amide bonds between the ubiquitin C terminus and primary amines in substrate proteins. Recently, SdeA, an effector protein of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila, was shown to mediate NAD-dependent and ATP-independent ubiquitin transfer to host proteins. Here, we identify a phosphodiesterase domain in SdeA that efficiently catalyzes phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin on a specific arginine via an ADP-ribose-ubiquitin intermediate. SdeA also catalyzes a chemically and structurally distinct type of substrate ubiquitination by conjugating phosphoribosylated ubiquitin to serine residues of protein substrates via a phosphodiester bond. Furthermore, phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin prevents activation of E1 and E2 enzymes of the conventional ubiquitination cascade, thereby impairing numerous cellular processes including mitophagy, TNF signaling, and proteasomal degradation. We propose that phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin potently modulates ubiquitin functions in mammalian cells.","['Bhogaraju S', 'Kalayil S', 'Liu Y', 'Bonn F', 'Colby T', 'Matic I', 'Dikic I']",2016,167,6,Cell,"Bhogaraju S, et al.

However, Legionella pneumonia results relatively often in admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). A significant complication is the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The ICU mortality rate for Legionella pneumonia is > 30% with conventional treatments.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to Legionella pneumonia complicated by ARDS. Despite maximum conventional therapy being given, including lung-protective invasive mechanical ventilation and prone positioning, progressive hypoxaemia persisted. In collaboration with an extracorporeal life support (ECLS) centre, venovenous ECLS was initiated. Pulmonary function recovered and the patient was successfully weaned from VV-ECLS after 17 days. After three months of hospitalisation and rehabilitation, the patient was discharged home and able to perform his activities of daily living without assistance.
CONCLUSION: Legionella pneumonia relatively frequently results in ICU admission, and carries a high mortality with conventional treatments.

27892503,Trans-translation is essential in the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila.,"Trans-translation is a ubiquitous bacterial mechanism for ribosome rescue in the event of translation stalling. Although trans-translation is not essential in several bacterial species, it has been found essential for viability or virulence in a wide range of pathogens. We describe here that trans-translation is essential in the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila, the etiologic agent of Legionnaire's disease (LD), a severe form of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia. The ssrA gene coding for tmRNA, the key component of trans-translation, could not be deleted in L. pneumophila. To circumvent this and analyse the consequences of impaired trans-translation, we placed ssrA under the control of a chemical inducer. Phenotypes associated with the inhibition of ssrA expression include growth arrest in rich medium, hampered cell division, and hindered ability to infect eukaryotic cells (amoebae and human macrophages). LD is often associated with failure of antibiotic treatment and death (>10% of clinical cases). Decreasing tmRNA levels led to significantly higher sensitivity to ribosome-targeting antibiotics, including to erythromycin. We also detected a higher sensitivity to the transcription inhibitor rifampicin. Both antibiotics are recommended treatments for LD. Thus, interfering with trans-translation may not only halt the infection, but could also potentiate the recommended therapeutic treatments of LD.","['Brunel R', 'Charpentier X']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,Brunel R and Charpentier X.

27865699,TNF-α inhibits the growth of Legionella pneumophila in airway epithelial cells by inducing apoptosis.,"BACKGROUND: TNF-α plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Legionella pneumophila (Lp)-induced pneumonia. Patients undergoing anti-TNF-α therapy are at an increased risk of Lp infection. Lp infects both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells such as airway epithelial cells; however, the role of TNF-α in airway epithelial cells is unknown.
METHODS: Human airway epithelial cell line NCI-H292 was infected with Lp NUL1 strain. After infection, both intracellular growth of Lp and cell death were evaluated after treating the cells with or without TNF-α. Apoptosis was examined by performing activated caspase-3/7 staining and by using a pan-caspase inhibitor.
RESULTS: Lp infected and replicated in NCI-H292 cells in a time-dependent manner, and TNF-α treatment of Lp-infected NCI-H292 cells inhibited Lp replication. Inhibitory effects of TNF-α on Lp replication were suppressed after treatment with a TNF-α-neutralizing antibody. Lp infection increased extracellular lactate dehydrogenase levels and decreased the number of living cells. Increased number of Lp-infected NCI-H292 cells showed caspase-3/7 activation, indicating they underwent apoptosis. TNF-α treatment inhibited Lp replication by increasing the apoptosis of NCI-H292 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our results suggested that airway epithelial cells were involved in the pathogenesis of Lp infection and that TNF-α played a protective role by inhibiting the intracellular replication of Lp and by increasing the apoptosis of Lp-infected airway epithelial cells. However, Lp infection should be investigated further in patients undergoing anti-TNF-α therapy who develop pneumonia.","['Kawamoto Y', 'Morinaga Y', 'Kimura Y', 'Kaku N', 'Kosai K', 'Uno N', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yanagihara K']",2017,23,1,J Infect Chemother,"Kawamoto Y, et al.

27848164,Septic arthritis due to Legionella cincinnatiensis: case report and review of the literature.,"Legionella spp. are an important cause of pulmonary and rarely extrapulmonary infections. L. cincinnatiensis has only been implicated in five cases to date. We herein report the first case of L. cincinnatiensis septic arthritis in a 90-year old lady with a past medical history of chronic kidney disease. She developed septic arthritis of her left wrist after having received intraarticular corticosteroid injections and oral corticosteroids administered for presumed chondrocalcinosis. Appropriate antimicrobial treatment of L. cincinnatiensis septic arthritis was delayed until identification of this organism in joint biopsies by broad-range bacterial PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene with subsequent rDNA sequence analysis and by culture on special media. Reviewing all reported cases of septic arthritis caused by Legionella spp. other than L. cincinnatiensis it is notable that diagnosis was established by PCR in the majority of cases and only subsequently confirmed by special culture. Although most patients were immunosuppressed, outcome was favourable. Treatment consisted of a fluoroquinolone alone or in combination with rifampicin or a macrolide. Our case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for infections with unusual/fastidious organisms when symptoms are suggestive of septic arthritis but conventional methods fail to identify a causative organism.","['Banderet F', 'Blaich A', 'Soleman E', 'Gaia V', 'Osthoff M']",2017,45,4,Infection,"Banderet F, et al.

27845476,Are liquids an efficient vehicle of healthcare associated infections? A review of reported cases in Italy (2000-2014).,"INTRODUCTION: In the field of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs), one of the most reported, studied and discussed sources of infections is water, partly due to its controllability, but also because healthcare facilities, especially hospitals, require a significant quantity of water per day. In addition to water, during healthcare procedures, other liquids can serve as source of infections. The present study reports a review of those HCAIs associated to liquid vehicles occurred in Italy during the period 2000-2014.
METHOD: The review focused on cases of liquid-associated HCAIs in both sporadic cases and outbreaks according to the definition provided by both Word Health Organization and United States' Centers for Disease Control and Preventions in 2011. The review included all original papers published in peer-reviewed journals, in which the association between the infection and the exposure to contaminated water/other fluid was demonstrated by epidemiological and/or molecular methods. Articles describing cases due to parenteral transmitted pathogens (by blood or blood-derived fluids) were excluded.
RESULTS: During the period 2000-2014, 34 episodes have been described for a total of about 400 cases of infection. Isolations included genus Legionella, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Ralstonia, Burkolderia, Klebsiella and other pseudomonadaceae. The results confirm that HCAIs can be associated also to liquids other than piped water. The large majority of articles refers to hospital wards where patients with high risk of infections are usually admitted.
DISCUSSION: The review highlights a great number of HCAIs, but if we consider that the large part of HCAIs are not reported in literature, it is clear that the burden of this phenomenon is by far higher. Many cases of HCAI were identified in the context of local surveillance systems, demonstrating their role in HCAI control. With regard to diagnosis, the isolation and identification of the etiological agent is critical to reach the source of infection and to plan the necessary disinfection measures. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that, through a multiple approach of engineering and hygiene measures, as well as surveillance ad management of hospital liquids, the risk for contracting ""water born"" HCAIs may be controlled.","[""D'Alessandro D"", 'Nusca A', 'Napoli C']",2016,28,6,Ann Ig,"D'Alessandro D, et al.

The experimental results indicate that the relationship between the ozone concentration, germ concentration, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) can be used to predict variations in germ and COD concentrations. The ozone reaction with COD and inactivation of Legionella occurred simultaneously, but the reaction with COD likely occurred at a higher rate than the inactivation, as COD is more easily oxidized by ozone than Legionella. Higher initial COD concentrations resulted in a lower inactivation rate and higher lnN/N","['Li J', 'Li K', 'Zhou Y', 'Li X', 'Tao T']",2017,168,,Chemosphere,"Li J, et al.

27826682,Silently transformable: the many ways bacteria conceal their built-in capacity of genetic exchange.,"Bacteria can undergo genetic transformation by actively integrating genetic information from phylogenetically related or unrelated organisms. The original function of natural transformation remains a subject of debate, but it is well established as a major player in genome evolution. Naturally transformable bacteria use a highly conserved DNA uptake system to internalize DNA and integrate it in their chromosome by homologous recombination. Expression of the DNA uptake system, often referred to as competence, is tightly controlled and induced by signals that are often elusive. Initially thought to be restricted to a few bacterial species, natural transformation increasingly seems widespread in bacteria. Yet, the triggering signals and regulatory mechanisms involved appear diverse and are understood only in a limited set of species. As a result, natural transformation in most bacterial species remains poorly documented and the potential impact of this mechanism on global genetic mobilization is likely underappreciated. Indeed, even when a conserved activator can be identified to artificially induce the expression of the DNA uptake system, the considered species may still remain non-transformable. Recent works indicate that the DNA uptake system is directly subjected to silencing. At least in Legionella pneumophila and possibly in other species, a small non-coding RNA prevents expression of the DNA uptake system. Silencing constitutes one more way bacteria control expression of their engine of genetic exchange. It may also be the underlying reason of the undetectable natural transformation of many bacterial species grown under laboratory conditions even though they possess a DNA uptake system.","['Attaiech L', 'Charpentier X']",2017,63,3,Curr Genet,Attaiech L and Charpentier X.

27524259,Are there effective interventions to prevent hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease or to reduce environmental reservoirs of Legionella in hospitals? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease (LD) is recognized as an important hospital-acquired disease. Despite the several methods available, the optimal method to control hospital-acquired LD is not well established and their overall efficacy requires further evaluation.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of interventions to prevent hospital-acquired LD in patients at high risk of developing the disease and its effects on environmental colonization.
METHODS: A database search was performed through PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (inception-November 2014). Eligible studies included all controlled studies evaluating interventions to prevent hospital-acquired LD in patients at high risk or evaluating the effect on environmental colonization. Both individual and pooled risk estimates were reported using risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
RESULTS: There were no studies evaluating the risk reduction in hospital-acquired LD, but 4 studies evaluated the influence of copper-silver ionization and ultraviolet light in the reduction of environmental reservoirs of Legionella. The meta-analysis showed a significant 95% risk reduction of Legionella positivity in environmental samples using copper-silver ionization (RR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.17) and 97% risk reduction with ultraviolet light (RR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.002-0.41).
CONCLUSIONS: The best available evidence suggests that copper-silver ionization and ultraviolet light are effective in reducing Legionella positivity in environmental samples. Nevertheless, the low quality of evidence weakens the robustness of conclusions.","['Almeida D', 'Cristovam E', 'Caldeira D', 'Ferreira JJ', 'Marques T']",2016,44,11,Am J Infect Control,"Almeida D, et al.

27805070,Legionella pneumophila prevents proliferation of its natural host Acanthamoeba castellanii.,"Legionella pneumophila is a ubiquitous, pathogenic, Gram-negative bacterium responsible for legionellosis. Like many other amoeba-resistant microorganisms, L. pneumophila resists host clearance and multiplies inside the cell. Through its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system, the bacterium injects more than three hundred effectors that modulate host cell physiology in order to promote its own intracellular replication. Here we report that L. pneumophila prevents proliferation of its natural host Acanthamoeba castellanii. Infected amoebae could not undergo DNA replication and no cell division was observed. The Dot/Icm secretion system was necessary for L. pneumophila to prevent the eukaryotic proliferation. The absence of proliferation was associated with altered amoebal morphology and with a decrease of mRNA transcript levels of CDC2b, a putative regulator of the A. castellanii cell cycle. Complementation of CDC28-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the CDC2b cDNA was sufficient to restore proliferation of CDC28-deficient S. cerevisiae and suggests for the first time that CDC2b from A. castellanii could be functional and a bona fide cyclin-dependent kinase. Hence, our results reveal that L. pneumophila impairs proliferation of A. castellanii and this effect could involve the cell cycle protein CDC2b.","['Mengue L', 'Régnacq M', 'Aucher W', 'Portier E', 'Héchard Y', 'Samba-Louaka A']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Mengue L, et al.

27662900,Multiple major disease-associated clones of Legionella pneumophila have emerged recently and independently.,"Legionella pneumophila is an environmental bacterium and the leading cause of Legionnaires' disease. Just five sequence types (ST), from more than 2000 currently described, cause nearly half of disease cases in northwest Europe. Here, we report the sequence and analyses of 364 L. pneumophila genomes, including 337 from the five disease-associated STs and 27 representative of the species diversity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the five STs have independent origins within a highly diverse species. The number of de novo mutations is extremely low with maximum pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ranging from 19 (ST47) to 127 (ST1), which suggests emergences within the last century. Isolates sampled geographically far apart differ by only a few SNPs, demonstrating rapid dissemination. These five STs have been recombining recently, leading to a shared pool of allelic variants potentially contributing to their increased disease propensity. The oldest clone, ST1, has spread globally; between 1940 and 2000, four new clones have emerged in Europe, which show long-distance, rapid dispersal. That a large proportion of clinical cases is caused by recently emerged and internationally dispersed clones, linked by convergent evolution, is surprising for an environmental bacterium traditionally considered to be an opportunistic pathogen. To simultaneously explain recent emergence, rapid spread and increased disease association, we hypothesize that these STs have adapted to new man-made environmental niches, which may be linked by human infection and transmission.","['David S', 'Rusniok C', 'Mentasti M', 'Gomez-Valero L', 'Harris SR', 'Lechat P', 'Lees J', 'Ginevra C', 'Glaser P', 'Ma L', 'Bouchier C', 'Underwood A', 'Jarraud S', 'Harrison TG', 'Parkhill J', 'Buchrieser C']",2016,26,11,Genome Res,"David S, et al.

25764275,Aetiology and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients in Norway.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Norway, data on the aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized patients are limited. The aims of this study were to investigate the bacterial aetiology of CAP in hospitalized patients in Norway, risk factors for CAP and possible differences in risk factors between patients with Legionnaire's disease and pneumonia because of other causes.
METHODS: Adult patients with radiologically confirmed CAP admitted to hospital were eligible for the study. Routine aerobic and Legionella culture of sputum, blood culture, urinary antigen test for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae, polymerase chain reaction detection of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis from throat specimens, and serology for L. pneumophila serogroup 1-6 were performed. A questionnaire, which included demographic and clinical data, risk factors and treatment, was completed.
RESULTS: We included 374 patients through a 20-month study period in 2007-2008. The aetiological agent was detected in 37% of cases. S. pneumoniae (20%) was the most prevalent agent, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (6%) and Legionella spp. (6%). Eight Legionella cases were diagnosed by urinary antigen test, of which four also had positive serology. In addition, 13 Legionella cases were diagnosed by serology. The degree of comorbidity was high. An increased risk of hospital-diagnosed Legionella pneumonia was found among patients with a diagnosis of chronic congestive heart failure.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that S. pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia in hospitalized patients, and the prevalence of Legionella pneumonia is probably higher in Norway than recognized previously.","['Røysted W', 'Simonsen Ø', 'Jenkins A', 'Sarjomaa M', 'Svendsen MV', 'Ragnhildstveit E', 'Tveten Y', 'Kanestrøm A', 'Waage H', 'Ringstad J']",2016,10,6,Clin Respir J,"Røysted W, et al.

27795316,Suppressor Mutations Linking gpsB with the First Committed Step of Peptidoglycan Biosynthesis in Listeria monocytogenes.,"UNLABELLED: The cell division protein GpsB is a regulator of the penicillin binding protein A1 (PBP A1) in the Gram-positive human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes Penicillin binding proteins mediate the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis as they polymerize and cross-link peptidoglycan strands, the main components of the bacterial cell wall. It is not known what other processes are controlled by GpsB. L. monocytogenes gpsB mutants are unable to grow at 42°C, but we observed that spontaneous suppressors correcting this defect arise on agar plates with high frequency. We here describe a first set of gpsB suppressors that mapped to the clpC and murZ genes. While ClpC is the ATPase component of the Clp protease, MurZ is a paralogue of the listerial UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 1-carboxyvinyltransferase MurA. Both enzymes catalyze the enolpyruvyl transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-GlcNAc, representing the first committed step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. We confirmed that clean deletion of the clpC or murZ gene suppressed the ΔgpsB phenotype. It turned out that the absence of either gene leads to accumulation of MurA, and we show that artificial overexpression of MurA alone was sufficient for suppression. Inactivation of other UDP-GlcNAc-consuming pathways also suppressed the heat-sensitive growth of the ΔgpsB mutant, suggesting that an increased influx of precursor molecules into peptidoglycan biosynthesis can compensate for the lack of GpsB. Our results support a model according to which PBP A1 becomes misregulated and thus toxic in the absence of GpsB due to unproductive consumption of cell wall precursor molecules.
IMPORTANCE: The late cell division protein GpsB is important for cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. GpsB of the human pathogen L. monocytogenes interacts with one of the key enzymes of this pathway, penicillin binding protein A1 (PBP A1), and influences its activity. PBP A1 catalyzes the last two steps of cell wall biosynthesis, but it is unknown how GpsB controls PBP A1. We observed that a L. monocytogenes gpsB mutant forms spontaneous suppressors and have mapped their mutations to genes mediating and influencing the first step of cell wall biosynthesis, likely stimulating the influx of metabolites into this pathway. We assume that GpsB is important to ensure productive incorporation of cell wall precursors into the peptidoglycan sacculus by PBP A1.","['Rismondo J', 'Bender JK', 'Halbedel S']",2017,199,1,J Bacteriol,"Rismondo J, et al.

Limited information is available on the total bacterial communities in tank water. Therefore, identification of dominant bacterial communities, diversity, and their distribution is important in understanding the microbial quality of tank water. In this study, the abundance and diversity of bacterial communities in 88 tank water samples collected from the urban areas of Brisbane (n=44) and the peri-urban center of Currumbin (n=44) in Southeast Queensland, Australia were determined using amplicon-based Illumina next-generation sequencing. In addition, the SourceTracker program was used to identify the sources of fecal contamination in tank water samples. Sequence reads were also analyzed to detect potential bacterial pathogenic genera in the tank water samples collected. Differences in sample coverage, alpha diversity, and richness did not differ significantly between the Brisbane and Currumbin tank water samples. Comamonadaceae and Planctomycetaceae were the most abundant families in all tank water samples. Curvibacter was the most abundant genus in all tank water samples. SourceTracker revealed that around 34% (Brisbane) and 43% (Currumbin) of tank water samples had a signature for bird fecal contamination. The potential opportunistic pathogenic genera including Burkholderia, Chromobacterium, Clostridium, Legionella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, and Pseudomonas were most prevalent in tank water samples. Next-generation sequencing can be used as an initial screening tool to identify a wide array of potential pathogenic genera in tank water samples followed by quantifying specific pathogen(s) of interest using more sensitive molecular assays such as quantitative PCR (qPCR).","['Ahmed W', 'Staley C', 'Hamilton KA', 'Beale DJ', 'Sadowsky MJ', 'Toze S', 'Haas CN']",2017,576,,Sci Total Environ,"Ahmed W, et al.

To investigate the preference of different sequence types (ST) for a specific temperature range, growth of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (SG1) ST1 (environmental strains), ST47, and ST62 (disease-associated strains) was measured in buffered yeast extract broth (BYEB) and biofilms grown on plasticized polyvinyl chloride in flowing heated drinking water originating from a groundwater supply. The optimum growth temperatures in BYEB were approximately 37°C (ST1), 39°C (ST47), and 41°C (ST62), with maximum growth temperatures of 42°C (ST1) and 43°C (ST47 and ST62). In the biofilm at 38°C, the ST47 and ST62 strains multiplied equally well compared to growth of the environmental ST1 strain and an indigenous L. pneumophila non-SG1 strain, all attaining a concentration of approximately 10
IMPORTANCE: Growth of Legionella pneumophila in tap water installations is a serious public health concern. The organism includes more than 2,100 varieties (sequence types). More than 50% of the reported cases of Legionnaires' disease are caused by a few sequence types which are very rarely detected in the environment. Strains of selected virulent sequence types proliferated in biofilms on surfaces exposed to warm (38°C) tap water to the same level as environmental varieties and multiplied well as pure culture in a nutrient-rich medium at temperatures of 42 and 43°C. However, these organisms did not grow in the biofilms at temperatures of ≥41°C. Typical host amoebae also did not multiply at these temperatures. Apparently, proliferation of thermotolerant host amoebae is needed to enable multiplication of the virulent L. pneumophila strains in the environment at elevated temperatures. The detection of these amoebae in water installations therefore is a scientific challenge with practical implications.","['van der Kooij D', 'Brouwer-Hanzens AJ', 'Veenendaal HR', 'Wullings BA']",2016,82,22,Appl Environ Microbiol,"van der Kooij D, et al.

Due to their unique physical and chemical properties, nanomaterials have been extensively used to develop biosensors for rapid detection of microorganisms with microbial cells and toxins as target analytes. In this paper, the design principles of nanomaterials-based biosensors for four selected analyte categories (bacteria cells, toxins, mycotoxins, and protozoa cells), closely associated with the target analytes' properties is reviewed. Five signal transducing methods that are less equipment intensive (colorimetric, fluorimetric, surface enhanced Raman scattering, electrochemical, and magnetic relaxometry methods) is described and compared for their sensory performance (in term oflimit of detection, dynamic range, and response time) for all analyte categories. In the end, the suitability of these five sensing principles for on-site or field applications is discussed. With a comprehensive coverage of nanomaterials, design principles, sensing principles, and assessment on the sensory performance and suitability for on-site application, this review offers valuable insight and perspective for designing suitable nanomaterials-based microorganism biosensors for a given application.","['Sutarlie L', 'Ow SY', 'Su X']",2017,12,4,Biotechnol J,"Sutarlie L, et al.

Furthermore, the extent to which easily obtainable clinical information predicts bacterial infection is unknown. We evaluated the diagnostic value of clinical examination and testing for C-reactive protein and procalcitonin for bacterial lower respiratory tract infection.
METHODS: Through a European diagnostic study, we recruited 3104 adults with acute cough (≤ 28 days) in primary care settings. All of the patients underwent clinical examination, measurement of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in blood, and chest radiography. Bacterial infection was determined by conventional culture, polymerase chain reaction and serology, and positive results were defined by the presence of 
RESULTS: Overall, 539 patients (17%) had bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, and 38 (1%) had bacterial pneumonia. The only item with diagnostic value for lower respiratory tract infection was discoloured sputum (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.59). Adding C-reactive protein above 30 mg/L increased the area under the ROC curve to 0.62 (95% CI 0.59-0.65). For bacterial pneumonia, comorbidity, fever and crackles on auscultation had diagnostic value (area under ROC curve 0.68, 95% CI 0.58-0.77). Adding C-reactive protein above 30 mg/L increased the area under the ROC curve to 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.87). Procalcitonin did not add diagnostic information for any bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, including bacterial pneumonia.
INTERPRETATION: In adults presenting with acute lower respiratory tract infection, signs, symptoms and C-reactive protein showed diagnostic value for a bacterial cause. However, the ability of these diagnostic indicators to exclude a bacterial cause was limited. Procalcitonin added no clinically relevant information.","['Teepe J', 'Broekhuizen BDL', 'Loens K', 'Lammens C', 'Ieven M', 'Goossens H', 'Little P', 'Butler CC', 'Coenen S', 'Godycki-Cwirko M', 'Verheij TJM', 'GRACE Consortium']",2017,189,2,CMAJ,"Teepe J, et al.

27760576,"Unusual Legionnaires' outbreak in cool, dry Western Canada: an investigation using genomic epidemiology.","An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease occurred in an inner city district in Calgary, Canada. This outbreak spanned a 3-week period in November-December 2012, and a total of eight cases were identified. Four of these cases were critically ill requiring intensive care admission but there was no associated mortality. All cases tested positive for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1) by urinary antigen testing. Five of the eight patients were culture positive for LP1 from respiratory specimens. These isolates were further identified as Knoxville monoclonal subtype and sequence subtype ST222. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the isolates differed by no more than a single vertically acquired single nucleotide variant, supporting a single point-source outbreak. Hypothesis-based environmental investigation and sampling was conducted; however, a definitive source was not identified. Geomapping of case movements within the affected urban sector revealed a 1·0 km common area of potential exposure, which coincided with multiple active construction sites that used water spray to minimize transient dust. This community point-source Legionnaires' disease outbreak is unique due to its ST222 subtype and occurrence in a relatively dry and cold weather setting in Western Canada. This report suggests community outbreaks of Legionella should not be overlooked as a possibility during late autumn and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.","['Knox NC', 'Weedmark KA', 'Conly J', 'Ensminger AW', 'Hosein FS', 'Drews SJ', 'Legionella Outbreak Investigative Team']",2017,145,2,Epidemiol Infect,"Knox NC, et al.

27739904,Clinical Utility of Testing for Legionella Pneumonia in Central Texas.,"RATIONALE: Legionella pneumophila is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the south central region of the United States, and regular testing may not be cost effective in areas of low incidence.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of Legionella in central Texas and to determine the cost effectiveness of Legionella urinary antigen testing.
METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with pneumonia between January 2001 and December 2013. Patients were identified by Binax Legionella urinary antigen and International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision codes. Demographic characteristics and clinical history of the confirmed Legionella pneumonia cases were obtained by chart review. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient characteristics.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over 12 years, 5,807 patients with 11,377 admissions for pneumonia were tested for Legionella urinary antigen. A positive Legionella urinary antigen was found in 17 patients. Cumulative incidence during the study period was 0.23%. Among the Legionella-positive patients, intensive care unit admission and median length of stay were 58.8% and 8.5 days, respectively. Most patients (64.7%) met American Thoracic Society criteria for severe pneumonia. All patients empirically received either a macrolide or fluoroquinolone covering Legionella. There were two in-hospital and three total 90-day deaths in those with a positive urinary antigen. The estimated cost of screening this population with Legionella urinary antigen was $214,438 over 13 years.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the low incidence of Legionella pneumonia in central Texas. Use of guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment provides coverage for Legionella. We speculate that testing in a low-prevalence area would not influence outcomes or be cost effective.","['Henry C', 'Boethel C', 'Copeland LA', 'Ghamande S', 'Arroliga AC', 'White HD']",2017,14,1,Ann Am Thorac Soc,"Henry C, et al.

The aim of the current study was to identify Legionella spp., Acanthamoeba spp., Vermamoeba (Hartmannella) vermiformis and Naegleria fowleri that persist in a harvested rainwater and solar pasteurization treatment system.
METHODS: Pasteurized (45 °C, 65 °C, 68 °C, 74 °C, 84 °C and 93 °C) and unpasteurized tank water samples were screened for Legionella spp. and the heterotrophic plate count was enumerated. Additionally, ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (EMA-qPCR) was utilized for the quantification of viable Legionella spp., Acanthamoeba spp., V. vermiformis and N. fowleri in pasteurized (68 °C, 74 °C, 84 °C and 93 °C) and unpasteurized tank water samples, respectively.
RESULTS: Of the 82 Legionella spp. isolated from unpasteurized tank water samples, Legionella longbeachae (35 %) was the most frequently isolated, followed by Legionella norrlandica (27 %) and Legionella rowbothamii (4 %). Additionally, a positive correlation was recorded between the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of Legionella spp. detected (ρ = 0.710, P = 0.048) and the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of Legionella spp. isolated (ρ = 0.779, P = 0.0028) from the tank water samples collected. Solar pasteurization was effective in reducing the gene copies of viable V. vermiformis (3-log) and N. fowleri (5-log) to below the lower limit of detection at temperatures of 68-93 °C and 74-93 °C, respectively. Conversely, while the gene copies of viable Legionella and Acanthamoeba were significantly reduced by 2-logs (P = 0.0024) and 1-log (P = 0.0015) overall, respectively, both organisms were still detected after pasteurization at 93 °C.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study indicate that Acanthamoeba spp. primarily acts as the vector and aids in the survival of Legionella spp. in the solar pasteurized rainwater as both organisms were detected and were viable at high temperatures (68-93 °C).","['Dobrowsky PH', 'Khan S', 'Cloete TE', 'Khan W']",2016,9,1,Parasit Vectors,"Dobrowsky PH, et al.

27720012,The Making and Taking of Lipids: The Role of Bacterial Lipid Synthesis and the Harnessing of Host Lipids in Bacterial Pathogenesis.,"In order to survive environmental stressors, including those induced by growth in the human host, bacterial pathogens will adjust their membrane physiology accordingly. These physiological changes also include the use of host-derived lipids to alter their own membranes and feed central metabolic pathways. Within the host, the pathogen is exposed to many stressful stimuli. A resulting adaptation is for pathogens to scavenge the host environment for readily available lipid sources. The pathogen takes advantage of these host-derived lipids to increase or decrease the rigidity of their own membranes, to provide themselves with valuable precursors to feed central metabolic pathways, or to impact host signalling and processes. Within, we review the diverse mechanisms that both extracellular and intracellular pathogens employ to alter their own membranes as well as their use of host-derived lipids in membrane synthesis and modification, in order to increase survival and perpetuate disease within the human host. Furthermore, we discuss how pathogen employed mechanistic utilization of host-derived lipids allows for their persistence, survival and potentiation of disease. A more thorough understanding of all of these mechanisms will have direct consequences for the development of new therapeutics, and specifically, therapeutics that target pathogens, while preserving normal flora.","['Fozo EM', 'Rucks EA']",2016,69,,Adv Microb Physiol,Fozo EM and Rucks EA.

27717486,Legionellosis in the occupational setting.,"Legionellosis is the common name for two infections, Legionnaires' disease (LD) and Pontiac fever (PF), both caused by Legionella bacteria. Although with low incidence, LD is an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Among community-acquired cases, an increasing number was reported to be linked to the occupational setting, posing the need for better recognition of work activities at risk of legionellosis. In this work, we selected and reviewed relevant literature on cases of occupational legionellosis published between 1978 and 2016 in order to define the: i) etiology; ii) sources of infection, iii) work activities at risk, iv) infection rates, v) predisposing factors, vi) mortality and vii) country distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first review to provide an analysis of cases of occupational legionellosis. A literature search in the PubMed website was started on January 31, 2015 and ended on June 30, 2016. Cases of occupational legionellosis documented in the scientific literature were retrieved from PubMed upon interrogation with the following keywords: ""Legionella pneumophila"", ""Legionnaires' disease"", ""Pontiac fever"", and ""legionellosis"", in combination with ""employees"", ""workers"", and ""occupational"". Abstracts were reviewed, and applicable articles were obtained. Only articles that met the inclusion criteria were considered. Forty-seven articles were selected, reporting confirmed cases of legionellosis which occurred over 66 years (1949-2015), and involved 805 workers (221, LD; 584, PF). Fatalities were all associated with LD, resulting in 4.1% mortality. The most common etiologic agents were Legionella pneumophila (58.5%) and Legionella feeleii (39.4%), the latter being responsible for only one large outbreak of PF. Workplaces more frequently associated with occupational legionellosis were industrial settings (62.0%), office buildings (27.3%) and healthcare facilities (6.3%), though cases were also reported from a variety of workplaces, e.g. artesian excavation and horticultural sites, lorry parks, ships, water and sewage plants. With few exceptions, cases occurred in industrialized countries of the northern hemisphere. Overall, our review highlights an extended spectrum of occupational categories at risk for legionellosis. For all categories, infection originated from exposure to work-generated aerosols contaminated with Legionella spp., and industrial facilities equipped with cooling towers or coolant systems were the most common occupational settings. These observations should raise awareness of the risk of acquiring legionellosis at work, and help to improve prevention and control measures for this infrequent but still problematic disease.","['Principe L', 'Tomao P', 'Visca P']",2017,152,,Environ Res,"Principe L, et al.

27706210,Molecular Typing of Legionella pneumophila Isolates in the Province of Quebec from 2005 to 2015.,"Legionella is found in natural and man-made aquatic environments, such as cooling towers and hot water plumbing infrastructures. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) is the most common etiological agent causing waterborne disease in the United States and Canada. This study reports the molecular characterization of Lp strains during a 10 year period. We conducted sequence-based typing (SBT) analysis on a large set of Lp isolates (n = 284) to investigate the province of Quebec sequence types (STs) distribution in order to identify dominant clusters. From 2005 to 2015, 181 clinical Lp isolates were typed by SBT (141 sporadic cases and 40 outbreak related cases). From the same period of time, 103 environmental isolates were also typed. Amongst the 108 sporadic cases of Lp1 typed, ST-62 was the most frequent (16.6%), followed by ST-213 (10.2%), ST-1 (8.3%) and ST-37 (8.3%). Amongst other serogroups (SG), ST-1327 (SG5) (27.3%) and ST-378 (SG10) (12.2%) were the most frequent. From the environmental isolates, ST-1 represent the more frequent SBT type (26.5%). Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram from the 108 sporadic cases of SG1 contains 4 major clusters (A to D) of related STs. Cluster B contains the majority of the strains (n = 61) and the three most frequent STs in our database (ST-62, ST-213 and ST-1). During the study period, we observed an important increase in the incidence rate in Quebec. All the community associated outbreaks, potentially or confirmed to be associated with a cooling tower were caused by Lp1 strains, by opposition to hospital associated outbreaks that were caused by serogroups of Lp other than SG1. The recent major Quebec City outbreak caused by ST-62, and the fact that this genotype is the most common in the province supports whole genome sequencing characterization of this particular sequence type in order to understand its evolution and associated virulence factors.","['Lévesque S', 'Lalancette C', 'Bernard K', 'Pacheco AL', 'Dion R', 'Longtin J', 'Tremblay C']",2016,11,10,PLoS One,"Lévesque S, et al.

In the public debate, livestock farming is increasingly criticized due to environmental disturbance and odor nuisance originating from such facilities. One method to reduce odor and ammonia is by exhaust air treatment, for example, by biological exhaust air purification processes with bio-trickling filters filled with tap water. Higher temperatures in the summer time and the generation of biofilms are ideal growth conditions for Legionella. However, there are no studies on the presence of Legionella in the water of bio-trickling filters and the release of Legionella-containing aerosols. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate Legionella in wash water and emitted bioaerosols of a bio-trickling filter system of a breeding sow facility. For this purpose, measurements were carried out using a cyclone sampler. In addition, samples of wash water were taken. Legionella were not found by culture methods. However, using molecular biological methods, Legionella spp. could be detected in wash water as well as in bioaerosol samples. With antibody-based methods, Legionella pneumophila were identified. Further studies are needed to investigate the environmental health relevance of Legionella-containing aerosols emitted by such exhaust air purification systems.","['Walser SM', 'Brenner B', 'Wunderlich A', 'Tuschak C', 'Huber S', 'Kolb S', 'Niessner R', 'Seidel M', 'Höller C', 'Herr CEW']",2017,575,,Sci Total Environ,"Walser SM, et al.

27684472,Genomic Analysis Reveals Novel Diversity among the 1976 Philadelphia Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak Isolates and Additional ST36 Strains.,"Legionella pneumophila was first recognized as a cause of severe and potentially fatal pneumonia during a large-scale outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (LD) at a Pennsylvania veterans' convention in Philadelphia, 1976. The ensuing investigation and recovery of four clinical isolates launched the fields of Legionella epidemiology and scientific research. Only one of the original isolates, ""Philadelphia-1"", has been widely distributed or extensively studied. Here we describe the whole-genome sequencing (WGS), complete assembly, and comparative analysis of all Philadelphia LD strains recovered from that investigation, along with L. pneumophila isolates sharing the Philadelphia sequence type (ST36). Analyses revealed that the 1976 outbreak was due to multiple serogroup 1 strains within the same genetic lineage, differentiated by an actively mobilized, self-replicating episome that is shared with L. pneumophila str. Paris, and two large, horizontally-transferred genomic loci, among other polymorphisms. We also found a completely unassociated ST36 strain that displayed remarkable genetic similarity to the historical Philadelphia isolates. This similar strain implies the presence of a potential clonal population, and suggests important implications may exist for considering epidemiological context when interpreting phylogenetic relationships among outbreak-associated isolates. Additional extensive archival research identified the Philadelphia isolate associated with a non-Legionnaire case of ""Broad Street pneumonia"", and provided new historical and genetic insights into the 1976 epidemic. This retrospective analysis has underscored the utility of fully-assembled WGS data for Legionella outbreak investigations, highlighting the increased resolution that comes from long-read sequencing and a sequence type-matched genomic data set.","['Mercante JW', 'Morrison SS', 'Desai HP', 'Raphael BH', 'Winchell JM']",2016,11,9,PLoS One,"Mercante JW, et al.

27671446,Characterization of aerosols containing Legionella generated upon nebulization.,"Legionella pneumophila is, by far, the species most frequently associated with Legionnaires' disease (LD). Human infection occurs almost exclusively by aerosol inhalation which places the bacteria in juxtaposition with alveolar macrophages. LD risk management is based on controlling water quality by applying standardized procedures. However, to gain a better understanding of the real risk of exposure, there is a need (i) to investigate under which conditions Legionella may be aerosolized and (ii) to quantify bacterial deposition into the respiratory tract upon nebulization. In this study, we used an original experimental set-up that enables the generation of aerosol particles containing L. pneumophila under various conditions. Using flow cytometry in combination with qPCR and culture, we determined (i) the size of the aerosols and (ii) the concentration of viable Legionella forms that may reach the thoracic region. We determined that the 0.26-2.5 μm aerosol size range represents 7% of initial bacterial suspension. Among the viable forms, 0.7% of initial viable bacterial suspension may reach the pulmonary alveoli. In conclusion, these deposition profiles can be used to standardize the size of inoculum injected in any type of respiratory tract model to obtain new insights into the dose response for LD.","['Allegra S', 'Leclerc L', 'Massard PA', 'Girardot F', 'Riffard S', 'Pourchez J']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Allegra S, et al.

27667984,Functional Metagenomics of Spacecraft Assembly Cleanrooms: Presence of Virulence Factors Associated with Human Pathogens.,"Strict planetary protection practices are implemented during spacecraft assembly to prevent inadvertent transfer of earth microorganisms to other planetary bodies. Therefore, spacecraft are assembled in cleanrooms, which undergo strict cleaning and decontamination procedures to reduce total microbial bioburden. We wanted to evaluate if these practices selectively favor survival and growth of hardy microorganisms, such as pathogens. Three geographically distinct cleanrooms were sampled during the assembly of three NASA spacecraft: The Lockheed Martin Aeronautics' Multiple Testing Facility during DAWN, the Kennedy Space Center's Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF) during Phoenix, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Spacecraft Assembly Facility during Mars Science Laboratory. Sample sets were collected from the KSC-PHSF cleanroom at three time points: before arrival of the Phoenix spacecraft, during the assembly and testing of the Phoenix spacecraft, and after removal of the spacecraft from the KSC-PHSF facility. All samples were subjected to metagenomic shotgun sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Strict decontamination procedures had a greater impact on microbial communities than sampling location Samples collected during spacecraft assembly were dominated by Acinetobacter spp. We found pathogens and potential virulence factors, which determine pathogenicity in all the samples tested during this study. Though the relative abundance of pathogens was lowest during the Phoenix assembly, potential virulence factors were higher during assembly compared to before and after assembly, indicating a survival advantage. Decreased phylogenetic and pathogenic diversity indicates that decontamination and preventative measures were effective against the majority of microorganisms and well implemented, however, pathogen abundance still increased over time. Four potential pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Escherichia coli and Legionella pneumophila, and their corresponding virulence factors were present in all cleanroom samples. This is the first functional metagenomics study describing presence of pathogens and their corresponding virulence factors in cleanroom environments. The results of this study should be considered for microbial monitoring of enclosed environments such as schools, homes, hospitals and more isolated habitation such the International Space Station and future manned missions to Mars.","['Bashir M', 'Ahmed M', 'Weinmaier T', 'Ciobanu D', 'Ivanova N', 'Pieber TR', 'Vaishampayan PA']",2016,7,,Front Microbiol,"Bashir M, et al.

27660867,Environmental factors affecting the survival of soil dwelling Legionella longbeachae in water.,"INTRODUCTION: Legionella longbeachae, a causative agent of Legionnaire's disease, has often been associated with potting soil and gardening, a feature quite distinct from other Legionella species. The precise transmission mechanism is still unknown, although due to the ecological coherence of the soil and water there is a potential risk of infection by contaminated stagnant water in the garden.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the ability of L. longbeachae to survive in stagnant tap water usually used for watering in gardens. The influence of different factors (temperature, pH and NaCl concentration) on L. longbeachae survival in stagnant tap water was also tested.
RESULTS: The result showed that L. longbeachae is viable in stagnant tap water over 100 days at 4 °C and 25 °C. The survival of L. longbeachae exposed to different pH and NaCl concentration suggests resistance to low pH values (pH2 and pH5) and all tested NaCl concentrations at temperatures lower than 25 °C. The ability of L. longbeachae to persist in stagnant tap water should be taken seriously in the risk assessments as a possible hidden reservoir of infection.","['Potočnjak M', 'MagdaleniĆ Z', 'Dijan M', 'RebiĆ D', 'Gobin I']",2016,23,3,Ann Agric Environ Med,"Potočnjak M, et al.

27640674,Energy Conservation and the Promotion of Legionella pneumophila Growth: The Probable Role of Heat Exchangers in a Nosocomial Outbreak.,"OBJECTIVE To determine the source of a Legionella pneumophila serogroup 5 nosocomial outbreak and the role of the heat exchanger installed on the hot water system within the previous year. SETTING A 400-bed tertiary care university hospital in Sherbrooke, Canada. METHODS Hot water samples were collected and cultured for L. pneumophila from 25 taps (baths and sinks) within wing A and 9 taps in wing B. Biofilm (5) and 2 L water samples (3) were collected within the heat exchangers for L. pneumophila culture and detection of protists. Sequence-based typing was performed on strain DNA extracts and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were analyzed. RESULTS Following 2 cases of hospital-acquired legionellosis, the hot water system investigation revealed a large proportion of L. pneumophila serogroup 5 positive taps (22/25 in wing A and 5/9 in wing B). High positivity was also detected in the heat exchanger of wing A in water samples (3/3) and swabs from the heat exchanger (4/5). The outbreak genotyping investigation identified the hot water system as the source of infections. Genotyping results revealed that all isolated environmental strains harbored the same related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern and sequence-based type. CONCLUSIONS Two cases of hospital-acquired legionellosis occurred in the year following the installation of a heat exchanger to preheat hospital hot water. No cases were reported previously, although the same L. pneumophila strain was isolated from the hot water system in 1995. The heat exchanger promoted L. pneumophila growth and may have contributed to confirmed clinical cases. Infect. Control Hosp.

27633769,Dynamics of genome change among Legionella species.,"Legionella species inhabit freshwater and soil ecosystems where they parasitize protozoa. L. pneumonphila (LP) serogroup-1 (Lp1) is the major cause of Legionnaires' Disease (LD), a life-threatening pulmonary infection that can spread systemically. The increased global frequency of LD caused by Lp and non-Lp species underscores the need to expand our knowledge of evolutionary forces underlying disease pathogenesis. Whole genome analyses of 43 strains, including all known Lp serogroups 1-17 and 17 emergent LD-causing Legionella species (of which 33 were sequenced in this study) in addition to 10 publicly available genomes, resolved the strains into four phylogenetic clades along host virulence demarcations. Clade-specific genes were distinct for genetic exchange and signal-transduction, indicating adaptation to specific cellular and/or environmental niches. CRISPR spacer comparisons hinted at larger pools of accessory DNA sequences in Lp than predicted by the pan-genome analyses. While recombination within Lp was frequent and has been reported previously, population structure analysis identified surprisingly few DNA admixture events between species. In summary, diverse Legionella LD-causing species share a conserved core-genome, are genetically isolated from each other, and selectively acquire genes with potential for enhanced virulence.","['Joseph SJ', 'Cox D', 'Wolff B', 'Morrison SS', 'Kozak-Muiznieks NA', 'Frace M', 'Didelot X', 'Castillo-Ramirez S', 'Winchell J', 'Read TD', 'Dean D']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Joseph SJ, et al.

27629106,Iron Availability Modulates the Persistence of Legionella pneumophila in Complex Biofilms.,"Legionella pneumophila is a pathogenic bacteria found in biofilms in freshwater. Iron is an essential nutrient for L. pneumophila growth. In this study, complex biofilms were developed using river water spiked with L. pneumophila, and the persistence of L. pneumophila in these complex biofilms was evaluated. In order to study the role of iron in the persistence of L. pneumophila, river water was supplied with either iron pyrophosphate or iron chelators (deferoxamine mesylate, DFX for ferric iron and dipyridyl, DIP for ferrous iron) to modulate iron availability. The addition of iron pyrophosphate and DFX did not markedly affect the persistence of L. pneumophila in the biofilms, whereas that of DIP had a beneficial effect. Since DIP specifically chelates ferrous iron, we hypothesized that DIP may protect L. pneumophila from the deleterious effects of ferrous iron. In conclusion, ferrous iron appears to be important for the persistence of L. pneumophila in complex biofilms. However, further studies are needed in order to obtain a better understanding of the role of ferrous iron in the behavior of this bacterium in the environment.","['Portier E', 'Bertaux J', 'Labanowski J', 'Hechard Y']",2016,31,4,Microbes Environ,"Portier E, et al.

27624495,Existence and control of Legionella bacteria in building water systems: A review.,"Legionellae are waterborne bacteria which are capable of causing potentially fatal Legionnaires' disease (LD), as well as Pontiac Fever. Public concern about Legionella exploded following the 1976 outbreak at the American Legion conference in Philadelphia, where 221 attendees contracted pneumonia and 34 died. Since that time, a variety of different control methods and strategies have been developed and implemented in an effort to eradicate Legionella from building water systems. Despite these efforts, the incidence of LD has been steadily increasing in the U.S. for more than a decade. Public health and occupational hygiene professionals have maintained an active debate regarding best practices for management and control of Legionella. Professional opinion remains divided with respect to the relative merits of performing routine sampling for Legionella, vs. the passive, reactive approach that has been largely embraced by public health officials and facility owners. Given the potential risks and ramifications associated with waiting to assess systems for Legionella until after disease has been identified and confirmed, a proactive approach of periodic testing for Legionella, along with proper water treatment, is the best approach to avoiding large-scale disease outbreaks.","['Springston JP', 'Yocavitch L']",2017,14,2,J Occup Environ Hyg,Springston JP and Yocavitch L.

27607556,Autophagy Evasion and Endoplasmic Reticulum Subversion: The Yin and Yang of Legionella Intracellular Infection.,"The gram-negative bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila creates a novel organelle inside of eukaryotic host cells that supports intracellular replication. The L. pneumophila-containing vacuole evades fusion with lysosomes and interacts intimately with the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although the natural hosts for L. pneumophila are free-living protozoa that reside in freshwater environments, the mechanisms that enable this pathogen to replicate intracellularly also function when mammalian macrophages phagocytose aerosolized bacteria, and infection of humans by L. pneumophila can result in a severe pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. A bacterial type IVB secretion system called Dot/Icm is essential for intracellular replication of L. pneumophila. The Dot/Icm apparatus delivers over 300 different bacterial proteins into host cells during infection. These bacterial proteins have biochemical activities that target evolutionarily conserved host factors that control membrane transport processes, which results in the formation of the ER-derived vacuole that supports L. pneumophila replication. This review highlights research discoveries that have defined interactions between vacuoles containing L. pneumophila and the host ER. These studies reveal how L. pneumophila creates a vacuole that supports intracellular replication by subverting host proteins that control biogenesis and fusion of early secretory vesicles that exit the ER and host proteins that regulate the shape and dynamics of the ER. In addition to recruiting ER-derived membranes for biogenesis of the vacuole in which L. pneumophila replicates, these studies have revealed that this pathogen has a remarkable ability to interfere with the host's cellular process of autophagy, which is an ancient cell autonomous defense pathway that utilizes ER-derived membranes to target intracellular pathogens for destruction. Thus, this intracellular pathogen has evolved multiple mechanisms to control membrane transport processes that center on the involvement of the host ER.","['Sherwood RK', 'Roy CR']",2016,70,,Annu Rev Microbiol,Sherwood RK and Roy CR.

27600508,Type II Secretion Is Necessary for Optimal Association of the Legionella-Containing Vacuole with Macrophage Rab1B but Enhances Intracellular Replication Mainly by Rab1B-Independent Mechanisms.,"Previously, we documented that type II secretion (T2S) promotes intracellular infection of macrophages by Legionella pneumophila In the present study, we identified infection events that are modulated by T2S by comparing the behaviors of wild-type and T2S mutant bacteria in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and human U937 cells. Although the two strains behaved similarly for entry into the host cells and evasion of lysosomal fusion, the mutant was impaired in the ability to initiate replication between 4 and 8 h postentry and to grow to large numbers in the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), as evident at 12 h. At 4 h postinoculation, mutant LCVs had a significantly reduced association with Rab1B, a host GTPase that facilitates the tethering of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles to LCVs. The mutant did not lose expression or translocation of six type IV secretion effectors (e.g., SidM) that are well known for mediating Rab1B association with the LCV, indicating that T2S promotes the interaction between the LCV and Rab1B via a novel mechanism. Interestingly, the mutant's growth defect was exacerbated in macrophages that had been depleted of Rab1B by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) treatment, indicating that T2S also potentiates events beyond Rab1B association. In support of this, a sidM lspF double mutant had an intracellular growth defect that was more dramatic than that of the lspF mutant (and a sidM mutant) and showed a growth difference of as much as a 400-fold compared to the wild type. Together, these data reveal a new role for T2S in intracellular infection that involves both Rab1B-dependent and Rab1B-independent processes.","['White RC', 'Cianciotto NP']",2016,84,12,Infect Immun,White RC and Cianciotto NP.

This review provides examples of airborne transmission of infectious agents from experimental and field studies and discusses how airborne pathogens can contaminate other parts of the environment to give rise to secondary vehicles leading air-surface-air nexus with possible transmission to susceptible hosts. The following groups of human pathogens are covered because of their known or potential airborne spread: vegetative bacteria (staphylococci and legionellae), fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium spp and Stachybotrys chartarum), enteric viruses (noro- and rotaviruses), respiratory viruses (influenza and coronaviruses), mycobacteria (tuberculous and nontuberculous), and bacterial spore formers (Clostridium difficile and Bacillus anthracis). An overview of methods for experimentally generating and recovering airborne human pathogens is included, along with a discussion of factors that influence microbial survival in indoor air. Available guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other global regulatory bodies for the study of airborne pathogens are critically reviewed with particular reference to microbial surrogates that are recommended.

The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC₉₀) against M pneumoniae (n= 14) was 0.03μg/mL which was comparable to GRNX, 4- and 16-fold more active than MFLX and LVFX, respectively. Reduced susceptibilities of M pneumoniae (9/14 isolates) to macrolides were observed. MIC₉₀ of STFX against L. pneumophila (n =15) was 0.004μg/mL which was 2- and 4-fold more active than GRNX/LVFX and MFLX, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration range of STFX against C. trachomatis (n=5) and C. pneumoniae (n=5) were from 0.015 to 0.03 and from 0.03 to 0.06μg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, differences between the activities of STFX against various clinical isolates in 2009 and those in 2012, which were already published in two articles (Jpn. J.

27573071,Predictive parameters of Legionella pneumophila occurrence in hospital water: HPCs and plumbing system installation age.,"Occurrence of Legionella pneumophila can be relevant to the installation age and the presence of heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs). This research illustrates L. pneumophila contamination of hospital water in accordance with the installation age and the presence of HPCs. One hundred and fifty samples were collected from hot and cold water systems and cultured on R2A and BCYE agar. L. pneumophila identification was done via specific biochemical tests. HPCs and L. pneumophila were detected in 96 and 37.3 % of the samples, respectively. The mean of HPCs density was 947 ± 998 CFU/ml; therefore, 52 % of the samples had higher densities than 500 CFU/ml. High densities of HPCs (>500 CFU/ml) led to colonization of L. pneumophila (≥1000 CFU/ml), mainly observed in cooling systems, gynecological, sonography, and NICU wards. Chi(2) test demonstrated that higher densities (>500 CFU/ml) of HPCs and L. pneumophila contamination in cold water were more frequent than warm water (OR: 2.3 and 1.49, respectively). Univariate regressions implied a significant difference between HPCs density and installation age in positive and negative tests of L. pneumophila (OR = 1.1, p < 0.001, OR = 1.2, p < 0.001). Mann-Whitney U test implied the significant effects of HPCs and installation age on L. pneumophila occurrences (p < 0.001). Spearman correlation and multivariate linear regression revealed significant differences between L. pneumophila and HPCs densities (r s  = 0.33, p < 0.001 and ß = 0.11, p = 0.02), but nonsignificant difference with installation age (r s  = 0.33, p < 0.001 and ß = 0.0, p = 0.91). The occurrence of L. pneumophila, HPCs, and installation age are relevant; so, plumbing system renovation with appropriate materials and promotion of the effective efforts for hospital's water quality assurance is highly recommended.","['Ghanizadeh G', 'Mirmohamadlou A', 'Esmaeli D']",2016,188,9,Environ Monit Assess,"Ghanizadeh G, et al.

27572839,Microbially cleaved immunoglobulins are sensed by the innate immune receptor LILRA2.,"Microbial proteases degrade a variety of host proteins(1-3). However, it has remained largely unknown why microorganisms have evolved to acquire such proteases and how the host responds to microbially degraded products. Here, we have found that immunoglobulins disrupted by microbial pathogens are specifically detected by leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A2 (LILRA2), an orphan activating receptor expressed on human myeloid cells. Proteases from Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumonia and Candida albicans cleaved the N-terminus of immunoglobulins. Identification of the immunoglobulin-cleaving protease from L. pneumophila revealed that the protease is conserved across some bacteria including Vibrio spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These microbially cleaved immunoglobulins but not normal immunoglobulins stimulated human neutrophils via LILRA2. In addition, stimulation of primary monocytes via LILRA2 inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila. When mice were infected with L. pneumophila, immunoglobulins were cleaved and recognized by LILRA2. More importantly, cleaved immunoglobulins were detected in patients with bacterial infections and stimulated LILRA2-expressing cells. Our findings demonstrate that LILRA2 is a type of innate immune receptor in the host immune system that detects immunoglobulin abnormalities caused by microbial pathogens.","['Hirayasu K', 'Saito F', 'Suenaga T', 'Shida K', 'Arase N', 'Oikawa K', 'Yamaoka T', 'Murota H', 'Chibana H', 'Nakagawa I', 'Kubori T', 'Nagai H', 'Nakamaru Y', 'Katayama I', 'Colonna M', 'Arase H']",2016,1,6,Nat Microbiol,"Hirayasu K, et al.

27572446,Global phylogeography and evolutionary history of Shigella dysenteriae type 1.,"Together with plague, smallpox and typhus, epidemics of dysentery have been a major scourge of human populations for centuries(1). A previous genomic study concluded that Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1), the epidemic dysentery bacillus, emerged and spread worldwide after the First World War, with no clear pattern of transmission(2). This is not consistent with the massive cyclic dysentery epidemics reported in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries(1,3,4) and the first isolation of Sd1 in Japan in 1897(5). Here, we report a whole-genome analysis of 331 Sd1 isolates from around the world, collected between 1915 and 2011, providing us with unprecedented insight into the historical spread of this pathogen. We show here that Sd1 has existed since at least the eighteenth century and that it swept the globe at the end of the nineteenth century, diversifying into distinct lineages associated with the First World War, Second World War and various conflicts or natural disasters across Africa, Asia and Central America. We also provide a unique historical perspective on the evolution of antibiotic resistance over a 100-year period, beginning decades before the antibiotic era, and identify a prevalent multiple antibiotic-resistant lineage in South Asia that was transmitted in several waves to Africa, where it caused severe outbreaks of disease.","['Njamkepo E', 'Fawal N', 'Tran-Dien A', 'Hawkey J', 'Strockbine N', 'Jenkins C', 'Talukder KA', 'Bercion R', 'Kuleshov K', 'Kolínská R', 'Russell JE', 'Kaftyreva L', 'Accou-Demartin M', 'Karas A', 'Vandenberg O', 'Mather AE', 'Mason CJ', 'Page AJ', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Bizet C', 'Gamian A', 'Carle I', 'Sow AG', 'Bouchier C', 'Wester AL', 'Lejay-Collin M', 'Fonkoua MC', 'Le Hello S', 'Blaser MJ', 'Jernberg C', 'Ruckly C', 'Mérens A', 'Page AL', 'Aslett M', 'Roggentin P', 'Fruth A', 'Denamur E', 'Venkatesan M', 'Bercovier H', 'Bodhidatta L', 'Chiou CS', 'Clermont D', 'Colonna B', 'Egorova S', 'Pazhani GP', 'Ezernitchi AV', 'Guigon G', 'Harris SR', 'Izumiya H', 'Korzeniowska-Kowal A', 'Lutyńska A', 'Gouali M', 'Grimont F', 'Langendorf C', 'Marejková M', 'Peterson LA', 'Perez-Perez G', 'Ngandjio A', 'Podkolzin A', 'Souche E', 'Makarova M', 'Shipulin GA', 'Ye C', 'Žemličková H', 'Herpay M', 'Grimont PA', 'Parkhill J', 'Sansonetti P', 'Holt KE', 'Brisse S', 'Thomson NR', 'Weill FX']",2016,1,,Nat Microbiol,"Njamkepo E, et al.

27572165,Eliminating Legionella by inhibiting BCL-XL to induce macrophage apoptosis.,"Human pathogenic Legionella replicate in alveolar macrophages and cause a potentially lethal form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease(1). Here, we have identified a host-directed therapeutic approach to eliminate intracellular Legionella infections. We demonstrate that the genetic deletion, or pharmacological inhibition, of the host cell pro-survival protein BCL-XL induces intrinsic apoptosis of macrophages infected with virulent Legionella strains, thereby abrogating Legionella replication. BCL-XL is essential for the survival of Legionella-infected macrophages due to bacterial inhibition of host-cell protein synthesis, resulting in reduced levels of the short-lived, related BCL-2 pro-survival family member, MCL-1. Consequently, a single dose of a BCL-XL-targeted BH3-mimetic therapy, or myeloid cell-restricted deletion of BCL-XL, limits Legionella replication and prevents lethal lung infections in mice. These results indicate that repurposing BH3-mimetic compounds, originally developed to induce cancer cell apoptosis, may have efficacy in treating Legionnaires' and other diseases caused by intracellular microbes.","['Speir M', 'Lawlor KE', 'Glaser SP', 'Abraham G', 'Chow S', 'Vogrin A', 'Schulze KE', 'Schuelein R', ""O'Reilly LA"", 'Mason K', 'Hartland EL', 'Lithgow T', 'Strasser A', 'Lessene G', 'Huang DC', 'Vince JE', 'Naderer T']",2016,1,,Nat Microbiol,"Speir M, et al.

We fitted Poisson regression models to estimate the association between meteorological variables and the weekly number of community-acquired LD cases. Temperature, rainfall and atmospheric pressure were all associated with LD risk with higher risk associated with simultaneous increase in temperature and rainfall. Temperatures >20 °C were not associated with a higher risk for LD.

27554054,Plasma contributes to the antimicrobial activity of whole blood against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"The whole blood model for infection has proven useful to analyze the immunological response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, because it exerts a significant antimicrobial activity. Although this activity has been generally assumed to be cellular, we have found that the leukocyte fraction of blood from healthy volunteers did not kill the bacilli. We have discovered that plasma was responsible for a large proportion, but not all, of the antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, infected monocytes controlled the mycobacterial multiplication when cultivated in the presence of plasma. Intriguingly, serum from the same donors did not share this activity, although it was able to eliminate the non-pathogenic Mycobacterium gordonae To identify the remaining components that participate in the antimycobacterial activity we fractionated blood in leukocytes, plasma, erythrocytes and platelets, and analyzed the bactericidal power of each fraction and their combinations using a factorial design. We found that erythrocytes, but not platelets, participated and showed by flow cytometry that mycobacteria physically associated with erythrocytes. We propose that in exposed healthy individuals that show 'early clearance' of the mycobacteria, the innate response is predominantly humoral, probably through the effect of antimicrobial peptides and proteins.","['López-Medrano R', 'Guerra-Laso JM', 'López-Fidalgo E', 'Diez-Tascón C', 'García-García S', 'Blanco-Conde S', 'Rivero-Lezcano OM']",2016,22,7,Innate Immun,"López-Medrano R, et al.

The presence of two Wolbachia strains in Dactylopius coccus from Mexico was revealed by PCR amplification of wsp and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. A metagenome analysis recovered the genome sequences of Candidatus Wolbachia bourtzisii wDacA (supergroup A) and Candidatus Wolbachia pipientis wDacB (supergroup B). Genome read coverage, as well as 16S rRNA clone sequencing, revealed that wDacB was more abundant than wDacA. The strains shared similar predicted metabolic capabilities that are common to Wolbachia, including riboflavin, ubiquinone, and heme biosynthesis, but lacked other vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis as well as glycolysis, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and sugar uptake systems. A complete tricarboxylic acid cycle and gluconeogenesis were predicted as well as limited amino acid biosynthesis. Uptake and catabolism of proline were evidenced in Dactylopius Wolbachia strains. Both strains possessed WO-like phage regions and type I and type IV secretion systems. Several efflux systems found suggested the existence of metal toxicity within their host. Besides already described putative virulence factors like ankyrin domain proteins, VlrC homologs, and patatin-like proteins, putative novel virulence factors related to those found in intracellular pathogens like Legionella and Mycobacterium are highlighted for the first time in Wolbachia Candidate genes identified in other Wolbachia that are likely involved in cytoplasmic incompatibility were found in wDacB but not in wDacA.","['Ramírez-Puebla ST', 'Ormeño-Orrillo E', 'Vera-Ponce de León A', 'Lozano L', 'Sanchez-Flores A', 'Rosenblueth M', 'Martínez-Romero E']",2016,6,10,G3 (Bethesda),"Ramírez-Puebla ST, et al.

The presence of Leg5,7Ac2 has been correlated with virulence in humans by mechanisms that likely involve subversion of the host's immune system or interactions with host cell surfaces due to its similarity to Neu5Ac. Investigation into its role in bacterial physiology and pathogenicity is limited as there are no effective sources of it. Herein, we construct a de novo Leg5,7Ac2 biosynthetic pathway by combining multiple metabolic modules from three different microbial sources (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C. jejuni, and L. pneumophila). Over-expression of this de novo pathway in Escherichia coli that has been engineered to lack two native catabolic pathways, enables significant quantities of Leg5,7Ac2 (≈120 mg L(-1) of culture broth) to be produced. Pure Leg5,7Ac2 could be isolated and converted into CMP-activated sugar for biochemical applications and a phenyl thioglycoside for chemical synthesis applications.

27536770,Mass Gatherings and Respiratory Disease Outbreaks in the United States - Should We Be Worried? Results from a Systematic Literature Review and Analysis of the National Outbreak Reporting System.,"BACKGROUND: Because mass gatherings create environments conducive for infectious disease transmission, public health officials may recommend postponing or canceling large gatherings during a moderate or severe pandemic. Despite these recommendations, limited empirical information exists on the frequency and characteristics of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the United States.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify articles about mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the United States from 2005 to 2014. A standard form was used to abstract information from relevant articles identified from six medical, behavioral and social science literature databases. We also analyzed data from the National Outbreaks Reporting System (NORS), maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2009, to estimate the frequency of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks reported to the system.
RESULTS: We identified 21 published articles describing 72 mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. Of these 72, 40 (56%) were associated with agriculture fairs and Influenza A H3N2v following probable swine exposure, and 25 (35%) with youth summer camps and pandemic Influenza A H1N1. Outbreaks of measles (n = 1) and mumps (n = 2) were linked to the international importation of disease. Between 2009 and 2013, 1,114 outbreaks were reported to NORS, including 96 respiratory disease outbreaks due to Legionella. None of these legionellosis outbreaks was linked to a mass gathering according to available data.
CONCLUSION: Mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks may be uncommon in the United States, but have been reported from fairs (zoonotic transmission) as well as at camps where participants have close social contact in communal housing. International importation can also be a contributing factor. NORS collects information on certain respiratory diseases and could serve as a platform to monitor mass gathering-related respiratory outbreaks in the future.","['Rainey JJ', 'Phelps T', 'Shi J']",2016,11,8,PLoS One,"Rainey JJ, et al.

27533856,Strategies for the reduction of Legionella in biological treatment systems.,"A community-wide outbreak of Legionnaire's disease occurred in Warstein, Germany, in August 2013. The epidemic strain, Legionella pneumophila Serogruppe 1, was isolated from an industrial wastewater stream entering the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Wartein, the WWTP itself, the river Wäster and air/water samples from an industrial cooling system 3 km downstream of the WWTP. The present study investigated the effect of physical-chemical disinfection methods on the reduction of the concentration of Legionella in the biological treatment and in the treated effluent entering the river Wäster. Additionally, to gain insight into the factors that promote the growth of Legionella in biological systems, growth experiments were made with different substrates and temperatures. The dosage rates of silver micro-particles, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide and ozone and pH stress to the activated sludge were not able to decrease the number of culturable Legionella spp. in the effluent. Nevertheless, the UV treatment of secondary treated effluent reduced Legionella spp. on average by 1.6-3.4 log units.

27522579,Inhibitors for the bacterial ectonucleotidase Lp1NTPDase from Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is an aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium of the genus Legionella, which constitutes the major causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. Recently a nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase) from L. pneumophila was identified and termed Lp1NTPDase; it was found to be a structural and functional homolog of mammalian NTPDases catalyzing the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and ADP to AMP. Its activity is believed to contribute to the virulence of Legionella pneumophila. Therefore Lp1NTPDase inhibitors are considered as novel antibacterial drugs. However, only weakly potent compounds are available so far. In the present study, a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based enzyme assay for monitoring the Lp1NTPDase activity was established. The enzymatic reaction was performed in a test tube followed by separation of substrate and products by CE and subsequent quantification by UV analysis. After kinetic characterization of the enzyme, a series of 1-amino-4-ar(alk)ylamino-2-sulfoanthraquinone derivatives structurally related to the anthraquinone dye Reactive Blue 2, a non-selective ecto-NTPDase inhibitor, was investigated for inhibitory activity on Lp1NTPDase using the CE-based enzyme assay. Derivatives bearing a large lipophilic substituent (e.g., fused aromatic rings) in the 4-position of the 1-amino-2-sulfoanthraquinone showed the highest inhibitory activity. Compounds with IC50 values in the low micromolar range were identified. The most potent inhibitor was 1-amino-4-[phenanthrene-9-yl-amino]-9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-2-sulfonate (28, PSB-16131), with an IC50-value of 4.24μM. It represents the most potent Lp1NTPDase inhibitor described to date. These findings may serve as a starting point for further optimization. Lp1NTPDase inhibition provides a novel approach for the (immuno)therapy of Legionella infections.","['Fiene A', 'Baqi Y', 'Malik EM', 'Newton P', 'Li W', 'Lee SY', 'Hartland EL', 'Müller CE']",2016,24,18,Bioorg Med Chem,"Fiene A, et al.

27521232,Distribution of Bexsero® Antigen Sequence Types (BASTs) in invasive meningococcal disease isolates: Implications for immunisation.,"Serogroup B is the only major disease-associated capsular group of Neisseria meningitidis for which no protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine is available. This has led to the development of multi-component protein-based vaccines that target serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), including Bexsero®, which was implemented for UK infants in 2015, and Trumenba®. Given the diversity of meningococcal protein antigens, post-implementation surveillance of IMD isolates, including characterisation of vaccine antigens, is essential for assessing the effectiveness of such vaccines. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), as realised in the Meningitis Research Foundation Meningococcus Genome Library (MRF-MGL), provides a rapid, comprehensive, and cost-effective approach to this. To facilitate the surveillance of the antigen targets included in Bexsero® (fHbp, PorA, NHBA and NadA) for protective immunity, a Bexsero® Antigen Sequence Type (BAST) scheme, based on deduced peptide sequence variants, was implemented in the PubMLST.org/neisseria database, which includes the MRF-MGL and other isolate collections. This scheme enabled the characterisation of vaccine antigen variants and here the invasive meningococci isolated in Great Britain and Ireland in the epidemiological years 2010/11 to 2013/14 are analysed. Many unique BASTs (647) were present, but nine of these accounted for 39% (775/1966) of isolates, with some temporal and geographic differences in BAST distribution. BASTs were strongly associated with other characteristics, such as serogroup and clonal complex (cc), and a significant increase in BAST-2 was associated with increased prevalence of serogroup W clonal complex 11 meningococci. Potential coverage was assessed by the examination of the antigen peptide sequences present in the vaccine and epidemiological dataset. There were 22.8-30.8% exact peptide matches to Bexsero® components and predicted coverage of 66.1%, based on genotype-phenotype modelling for 63.7% of serogroup B isolates from 2010/14 in UK and Ireland. While there are many caveats to this estimate, it lies within the range of other published estimates.","['Brehony C', 'Rodrigues CMC', 'Borrow R', 'Smith A', 'Cunney R', 'Moxon ER', 'Maiden MCJ']",2016,34,39,Vaccine,"Brehony C, et al.

27498630,Post-industrial river water quality-Fit for bathing again?,"For the Ruhr River, bathing has been prohibited for decades. However, along with significant improvements of the hygienic water quality, there is an increasing demand of using the river for recreational purposes, in particular for bathing. In the ""Safe Ruhr"" interdisciplinary research project, demands, options and chances for lifting the bathing ban for the Ruhr River were investigated. As being the prominent reason for persisting recreational restrictions, microbiological water quality was in the focus of interest. Not only the faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) as required by the European Bathing Water Directive were considered, but also pathogens such as Salmonella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Campylobacter, Leptospira, enteroviruses and protozoan parasites. In this introductory paper, we firstly relate current recreational desires to historical experiences of river bathing. After recapitulating relevant microbial river contamination sources (predominantly sewage treatment plants, combined sewer overflows, and surface runoffs), we review existing knowledge about the relationships of FIOs and pathogens in rivers designated for recreational purposes, and then trace the evolution, rationale and validity of recreational freshwater quality criteria which are, despite obvious uncertainties, mostly relying on the FIO paradigm. In particular, the representativeness of FIOs is critically discussed. The working programme of Safe Ruhr, aiming at initiating and facilitating a process towards legalisation of Ruhr River bathing, is outlined. Sources of contamination can be technically handled which leaves the actual measures to political decisions. As contaminations are transient, only occasionally exceeding legal limits, a flexible bathing site management, warning bathers of non-safe situations, may amend technical interventions and offer innovative solutions. As a result, a situation-adapted system for lifting of the bathing ban for Ruhr River appears realistic.","['Kistemann T', 'Schmidt A', 'Flemming HC']",2016,219,7 Pt B,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Kistemann T, et al.

Eighty L. pneumophila serogroup 2 to 14 strains isolated from water distribution systems of hotels, hospitals, athletic venues, and ferries in Greece were tested by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for serogroup discrimination and molecularly by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) for genetic diversity. Fifty-six of 80 strains were also typed by the sequence-based typing (SBT) method. Αll strains were further analyzed for detection of two pathogenicity loci: Legionella vir homologue (lvh) and repeats in structural toxin (rtxA). Thirty-seven strains (46.2%) belonged to serogroup 6, 26 strains (32.5%) to serogroup 3, and 7 (8.8%) to other serogroups (4, 5, 8, and 10). Ten strains (12.5%) were nontypeable (NT) into the known serogroups. Thirty-nine different AFLP types were found among the 80 L. pneumophila serogroup 2 to 14 strains, and 24 different SBT types were found among the 56 strains tested. Among the 80 strains, the lvh locus was present in 75 (93.8%), the rtxA locus was found in 76 (95%), and both loci were found in 73 (91.3%) strains. This study showed that there is genetic variability of L. pneumophila serogroups 2 to 14 in the Greek environment as well as a high percentage of the pathogenicity loci. Ιntroducing an effective diagnostic test for L. pneumophila serogroups 2 to 14 in urine and promoting the examination of respiratory specimens from patients hospitalized for pneumonia in Greek hospitals are essential.
IMPORTANCE: In this study, the dispersion, clonality, and virulence of environmental isolates of Legionella pneumophila serogroups 2 to 14 (Lp2-14) in Greece were investigated. Genetic variability of Lp2-14 in the Greek environment was identified together with the presence of the pathogenicity loci in a high percentage of the isolates. Despite the high prevalence of Lp2-14 in the Greek environment, no clinical cases were reported, which may be due to underdiagnosis of the disease. Almost all the legionellosis cases are diagnosed in Greece by using the urine antigen test, which is specific for Lp1. There is an urgent need to improve the clinical diagnosis of legionellosis by introducing an effective diagnostic test for Lp2-14 in urine and by promoting the PCR examination of respiratory specimens from patients with compatible clinical symptoms.","['Katsiaflaka A', 'Pournaras S', 'Kristo I', 'Mouchtouri VA', 'Kyritsi M', 'Velonakis E', 'Vatopoulos AC', 'Hadjichristodoulou C']",2016,82,20,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Katsiaflaka A, et al.

27494738,New insights into Legionella pneumophila biofilm regulation by c-di-GMP signaling.,"The waterborne pathogen Legionella pneumophila grows as a biofilm, freely or inside amoebae. Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP), a bacterial second messenger frequently implicated in biofilm formation, is synthesized and degraded by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), respectively. To characterize the c-di-GMP-metabolizing enzymes involved in L. pneumophila biofilm regulation, the consequences on biofilm formation and the c-di-GMP concentration of each corresponding gene inactivation were assessed in the Lens strain. The results showed that one DGC and two PDEs enhance different aspects of biofilm formation, while two proteins with dual activity (DGC/PDE) inhibit biofilm growth. Surprisingly, only two mutants exhibited a change in global c-di-GMP concentration. This study highlights that specific c-di-GMP pathways control L. pneumophila biofilm formation, most likely via temporary and/or local modulation of c-di-GMP concentration. Furthermore, Lpl1054 DGC is required to enable the formation a dense biofilm in response to nitric oxide, a signal for biofilm dispersion in many other species.","['Pécastaings S', 'Allombert J', 'Lajoie B', 'Doublet P', 'Roques C', 'Vianney A']",2016,32,8,Biofouling,"Pécastaings S, et al.

27484084,ClpP-deletion impairs the virulence of Legionella pneumophila and the optimal translocation of effector proteins.,"BACKGROUND: The opportunistic bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila uses substrate effectors of Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4BSS) to accomplish survival and replication in amoebae cells and mammalian alveolar macrophages. During the conversion between its highly resistant, infectious dormant form and vigorously growing, uninfectious replicative form, L. pneumophila utilizes a complicated regulatory network in which proteolysis may play a significant role. As a highly conserved core protease, ClpP is involved in various cellular processes as well as virulence in bacteria, and has been proved to be required for the expression of transmission traits and cell division of L. pneumophila.
RESULTS: The clpP-deficient L. pneumophila strain failed to replicate and was digested in the first 3 h post-infection in mammalian cells J774A.1. Further investigation demonstrates that the clpP deficient mutant strain was unable to escape the endosome-lysosomal pathway in host cells. We also found that the clpP deficient mutant strain still expresses T4BSS components, induces contact-dependent cytotoxicity and translocate effector proteins RalF and LegK2, indicating that its T4BSS was overall functional. Interestingly, we further found that the translocation of several effector proteins is significantly reduced without ClpP.
CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that ClpP plays an important role in regulating the virulence and effector translocation of Legionella pneumophila.","['Zhao BB', 'Li XH', 'Zeng YL', 'Lu YJ']",2016,16,1,BMC Microbiol,"Zhao BB, et al.

27482806,Viral etiology in adult influenza-like illness/acute respiratory infection and predictivity of C-reactive protein.,"INTRODUCTION: Influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) are common presentations during winter and indiscriminate antibiotic use contributes significantly to the emerging post-antibiotic era.
METHODOLOGY: Otherwise healthy 152 patients, presenting to outpatient clinics with ILI/ARI, were included. Patients had history & physical, CRP, hemogram and nasopharyngeal swabs for rhinovirus A/B, influenza A/B, adenovirus A/B/C/D/E, coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, respiratory syncytial virusA/B, metapneumovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Bordetella pertussis by PCR and for ABHS culture.
RESULTS: Median (IR) age was 26.5 (16.5). Time to presentation was shorter in men (p = 0.027). Patients with rhinovirus had lower rates (20%) of myalgia (p = 0.043). Patients with influenza virus had higher rates (97%) of elevated CRP (p = 0.016). Logistic regression revealed that patients with ILI/ARI and CRP ≥ 5 mg/L were 60 times more likely to have influenza virus infection than other viral agents (OR = 60.0, 95% CI = 2.65 to 1,358.2, p = 0.010). Rhinovirus predominated in December (54%), March (36%), and April (33%). Influenza virus predominated in January (51%). Fever was most common with adenovirus (p = 0.198). All GABHS cultures were negative. Atypical organisms and Bordetella pertussis were negative in all but one patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus is the most likely pathogen in ILI/ARI when CRP ≥ 5 mg/L. This might be explained by tissue destruction. Myalgia is rare with rhinovirus probably due to absence of viremia. Negative bacteria by PCR and culture suggest unnecessary antibiotic use in ILI/ARI.","['Cinemre H', 'Karacer C', 'Yücel M', 'Öğütlü A', 'Cinemre FB', 'Tamer A', 'Karabay O']",2016,10,7,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Cinemre H, et al.

27482120,Innate immunity kinase TAK1 phosphorylates Rab1 on a hotspot for posttranslational modifications by host and pathogen.,"TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a critical signaling hub responsible for translating antigen binding signals to immune receptors for the activation of the AP-1 and NF-κB master transcriptional programs. Despite its importance, known substrates of TAK1 are limited to kinases of the MAPK and IKK families and include no direct effectors of biochemical processes. Here, we identify over 200 substrates of TAK1 using a chemical genetic kinase strategy. We validate phosphorylation of the dynamic switch II region of GTPase Rab1, a mediator of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicular transport, at T75 to be regulated by TAK1 in vivo. TAK1 preferentially phosphorylates the inactive (GDP-bound) state of Rab1. Phosphorylation of Rab1 disrupts interaction with GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 (GDI1), but not guanine exchange factor (GEF) or GTPase-activating protein (GAP) enzymes, and is exclusive to membrane-localized Rab1, suggesting phosphorylation may stimulate Rab1 membrane association. Furthermore, we found phosphorylation of Rab1 at T75 to be essential for Rab1 function. Previous studies established that the pathogen Legionella pneumophila is capable of hijacking Rab1 function through posttranslational modifications of the switch II region. Here, we present evidence that Rab1 is regulated by the host in a similar fashion, and that the innate immunity kinase TAK1 and Legionella effectors compete to regulate Rab1 by switch II modifications during infection.","['Levin RS', 'Hertz NT', 'Burlingame AL', 'Shokat KM', 'Mukherjee S']",2016,113,33,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Levin RS, et al.

METHODS: The L. dumoffii strain Tex-KL was mutated using the Tn903 derivative, Tn903dIIlacZ. After screening 799 transposon insertion mutants, we isolated one defective mutant. We then constructed the gene-disrupted mutant, KL16, and studied its invasion of and intracellular growth in HeLa and A549 cells, and in A/J mice survival experiments. The structure of traC-traD operon was analyzed by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The transposon insertion was in a gene homologous to Salmonella typhi traC, which is required for the assembly of F pilin into the mature F pilus structure and for conjugal DNA transmission. Results from RT-PCR suggested that the traC-traD region formed an operon. We found that when the traC gene was disrupted, invasion and intracellular growth of L. dumoffii Tex-KL were impaired in human epithelial cells. When mice were infected by intranasal inoculation with a traC deficient mutant, their survival significantly increased when compared to mice infected with the wild-type strain..
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the traC-traD operon is required for the invasion and intracellular growth abilities of L. dumoffii Tex-KL in epithelial cells.","['Qin T', 'Ken-Ichiro I', 'Ren HY', 'Zhou HJ', 'Yoshida S']",2016,29,6,Biomed Environ Sci,"Qin T, et al.

Here we characterized the taxonomic and derived functional profiles of lung microbiota in 165 non-malignant lung tissue samples from cancer patients.
RESULTS: We show that the lung microbiota is distinct from the microbial communities in oral, nasal, stool, skin, and vagina, with Proteobacteria as the dominant phylum (60 %). Microbiota taxonomic alpha diversity increases with environmental exposures, such as air particulates, residence in low to high population density areas, and pack-years of tobacco smoking and decreases in subjects with history of chronic bronchitis. Genus Thermus is more abundant in tissue from advanced stage (IIIB, IV) patients, while Legionella is higher in patients who develop metastases. Moreover, the non-malignant lung tissues have higher microbiota alpha diversity than the paired tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insights into the human lung microbiota composition and function and their link to human lifestyle and clinical outcomes. Studies among subjects without lung cancer are needed to confirm our findings.","['Yu G', 'Gail MH', 'Consonni D', 'Carugno M', 'Humphrys M', 'Pesatori AC', 'Caporaso NE', 'Goedert JJ', 'Ravel J', 'Landi MT']",2016,17,1,Genome Biol,"Yu G, et al.

27460809,Inflammasome Recognition and Regulation of the Legionella Flagellum.,"The Gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila colonizes extracellular environmental niches and infects free-living protozoa. Upon inhalation into the human lung, the opportunistic pathogen grows in macrophages and causes a fulminant pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. L. pneumophila employs a biphasic life cycle, comprising a replicative, non-virulent, and a stationary, virulent form. In the latter phase, the pathogen produces a plethora of so-called effector proteins, which are injected into host cells, where they subvert pivotal processes and promote the formation of a distinct membrane-bound compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole. In the stationary phase, the bacteria also produce a single monopolar flagellum and become motile. L. pneumophila flagellin is recognized by and triggers the host's NAIP5 (Birc1e)/NLRC4 (Ipaf) inflammasome, which leads to caspase-1 activation, pore formation, and pyroptosis. The production of L. pneumophila flagellin and pathogen-host interactions are controlled by a complex stationary phase regulatory network, detecting nutrient availability as well as the Legionella quorum sensing (Lqs) signaling compound LAI-1 (3-hydroxypentadecane-4-one). Thus, the small molecule LAI-1 coordinates L. pneumophila flagellin production and motility, inflammasome activation, and virulence.","['Schell U', 'Simon S', 'Hilbi H']",2016,397,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Schell U, et al.

27459964,Goodpasture's syndrome with absence of circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Goodpasture's syndrome, a rare disease, is an organ-specific autoimmune disease mediated by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. Its pathology is characterized by crescentic glomerulonephritis with linear immunofluorescent staining for immunoglobulin G on the glomerular basement membrane. Although rare, a few cases with absence of circulating anti-glomerular membrane antibodies have been described.
CASE PRESENTATION: The objective of this clinical case report is to describe and discuss a case of a 27-year-old white man who was hospitalized with a 1-year history of weight loss and a 1-month history of hemoptysis, with aggravation  the day before, having developed dyspnea and cough in the previous 24 hours. An analytical study showed normocytic normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL and leukocytosis with normal renal function and coagulation times. A blood transfusion was performed without complications. Chest computed tomography revealed a reticulonodular infiltrate of both lungs. Bronchoscopy showed no apparent lesions. Sputum cultures, rapid urine antigens for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae, studies for Influenza, virologic markers and serologic studies for autoimmunity were all negative. At the end of the tenth day his general state deteriorated with fatigue, hematuria, and in 3 days he developed aggravation of renal function with recurrent hemoptysis and anemia. Immunosuppression with daily prednisolone 1 g administered intravenously was initiated. An urgent bronchoscopy showed no lesions. A kidney biopsy showed fibrinoid necrosis and cellular crescents. Immunofluorescence revealed a linear immunoglobulin G deposition compatible with Goodpasture's syndrome. Immunosuppressive therapy with daily cyclophosphamide 120 mg orally was added. Subsequently he was transferred to a referral center at which 21 sessions of plasmapheresis and four sessions of hemodialysis were performed with good response; he currently has no need of hemodialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies in Goodpasture's syndrome adds complexity to the diagnosis creating an unusual setting in a rare disease. In our case a kidney biopsy was essential for diagnosis and clinical approach. Studies have shown that early aggressive therapy leads to an improved prognosis. Physicians should consider tissue diagnoses such as bronchoscopy and kidney biopsy in pulmonary renal syndrome.","['Fernandes R', 'Freitas S', 'Cunha P', 'Alves G', 'Cotter J']",2016,10,,J Med Case Rep,"Fernandes R, et al.

27459495,Legionella pneumophila Type IV Effectors YlfA and YlfB Are SNARE-Like Proteins that Form Homo- and Heteromeric Complexes and Enhance the Efficiency of Vacuole Remodeling.,"Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium that can colonize both freshwater protozoa and human alveolar macrophages, the latter infection resulting in Legionnaires' disease. The intracellular lifecycle of L. pneumophila requires extensive manipulation of its host cell, which is carried out by effector proteins that are translocated into the host cell through the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. This study focuses on a pair of highly similar type IV substrates called YlfA/LegC7 and YlfB/LegC2 that were initially identified in a screen for proteins that cause growth inhibition in yeast. Analysis of truncation mutants revealed that the hydrophobic residues in the Ylf amino termini were required for localization of each protein to the membranes of host cells. Central and carboxy terminal coiled coil domains were found to mediate binding of YlfA and YlfB to themselves and to each other. In vivo, a ΔylfA ΔylfB double mutant strain of L. pneumophila was shown to be defective in establishing a vacuole that supports bacterial replication. This phenotype was subsequently correlated with a decrease in the association of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles with vacuoles containing ΔylfA ΔylfB mutant bacteria. These data suggest that the Ylf proteins are membrane-associated effectors that enhance remodeling of the L. pneumophila -containing vacuole by promoting association and possibly fusion of ER-derived membrane vesicles with the bacterial compartment.","['Campodonico EM', 'Roy CR', 'Ninio S']",2016,11,7,PLoS One,"Campodonico EM, et al.

27455397,The life stage-specific pathometabolism of Legionella pneumophila.,"The genus Legionella belongs to Gram-negative bacteria found ubiquitously in aquatic habitats, where it grows in natural biofilms and replicates intracellularly in various protozoa (amoebae, ciliates). L. pneumophila is known as the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, since it is also able to replicate in human alveolar macrophages, finally leading to inflammation of the lung and pneumonia. To withstand the degradation by its host cells, a Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) is established for intracellular replication, and numerous effector proteins are secreted into the host cytosol using a type four B secretion system (T4BSS). During intracellular replication, Legionella has a biphasic developmental cycle that alternates between a replicative and a transmissive form. New knowledge about the host-adapted and life stage-dependent metabolism of intracellular L. pneumophila revealed a bipartite metabolic network with life stage-specific usages of amino acids (e.g. serine), carbohydrates (e.g. glucose) and glycerol as major substrates. These metabolic features are associated with the differentiation of the intracellular bacteria, and thus have an important impact on the virulence of L. pneumophila.","['Eisenreich W', 'Heuner K']",2016,590,21,FEBS Lett,Eisenreich W and Heuner K.

We tested hydrogen peroxide (Peroxy Ag⁺) at 600 ppm to evaluate Legionella survival in a simulated dental treatment water system equipped with Water Hygienization Equipment (W.H.E.) device that was artificially contaminated. When Legionella pneumophila serogroup (sg) 1 was exposed to Peroxy Ag⁺ for 60 min we obtained a two decimal log reduction. High antimicrobial efficacy was obtained with extended periods of exposure: four decimal log reduction at 75 min and five decimal log reduction at 15 h of exposure. Involving a simulation device (Peroxy Ag⁺ is flushed into the simulation dental unit waterlines (DUWL)) we obtained an average reduction of 85% of Legionella load. The product is effective in reducing the number of Legionella cells after 75 min of contact time (99.997%) in the simulator device under test conditions. The Peroxy Ag⁺ treatment is safe for continuous use in the dental water supply system (i.e., it is safe for patient contact), so it could be used as a preventive option, and it may be useful in long-term treatments, alone or coupled with a daily or periodic shock treatment.","['Ditommaso S', 'Giacomuzzi M', 'Ricciardi E', 'Zotti CM']",2016,13,5,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Ditommaso S, et al.

27454787,Pulmonary Legionellosis in Oncologic Patients: Findings on Chest CT.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the computed tomography (CT) findings of non-pneumophila Legionella pneumonia and to compare these CT findings to those caused by Legionella pneumophila in oncologic patients.
METHODS: Chest CT scans of 34 oncologic patients with culture-proven Legionella infection (16 L. pneumophila and 18 non-pneumophila Legionella) were retrospectively reviewed. Radiologic checkpoints included consolidation, ground-glass opacities, cavitation, nodules, tree-in-bud opacities, septal thickening, pleural effusions, and adenopathy, as well as the halo, reversed halo, and bulging fissure signs.
RESULTS: The most common imaging feature of Legionella pneumonia was consolidation, seen in 94% of patients. Ground-glass opacities were the next most common abnormality. The halo sign was present in 26% of patients, in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts. Most features occurred with similar frequency between L. pneumophila and non-pneumophila Legionella.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings in L. pneumophila pneumonia and non-pneumophila Legionella pneumonia are similar but nonspecific. Airspace consolidation is almost always present; the halo sign is not uncommon.","['Shroff GS', 'Marom EM', 'Wu CC', 'Godoy MC', 'Wei W', 'Ihegword A', 'Han XY', 'Truong MT']",2016,40,6,J Comput Assist Tomogr,"Shroff GS, et al.

27442238,First Case of Legionnaire's Disease Caused by Legionella anisa in Spain and the Limitations on the Diagnosis of Legionella non-pneumophila Infections.,"Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia, with worldwide relevance, caused by Legionella spp. Approximately 90% of all cases of legionellosis are caused by Legionella pneumophila, but other species can also be responsible for this infection. These bacteria are transmitted by inhalation of aerosols or aspiration of contaminated water. In Spain, environmental studies have demonstrated the presence of Legionella non-pneumophila species in drinking water treatment plants and water distribution networks. Aware that this evidence indicates a risk factor and the lack of routine assays designed to detect simultaneously diverse Legionella species, we analyzed 210 urine samples from patients presenting clinical manifestations of pneumonia using a semi-nested PCR for partial amplification of the 16S rDNA gene of Legionella and a diagnostic method used in hospitals for Legionella antigen detection. In this study, we detected a total of 15 cases of legionellosis (7.1%) and the first case of Legionnaires' disease caused by L. anisa in Spain. While the conventional method used in hospitals could only detect four cases (1.9%) produced by L. pneumophila serogroup 1, using PCR, the following species were identified: Legionella spp. (10/15), L. pneumophila (4/15) and L. anisa (1/15). These results suggest the need to change hospital diagnostic strategies regarding the identification of Legionella species associated with this disease. Therefore, the detection of Legionella DNA by PCR in urine samples seems to be a suitable alternative method for a sensitive, accurate and rapid diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia, caused by L. pneumophila and also for L. non-pneumophila species.","['Vaccaro L', 'Izquierdo F', 'Magnet A', 'Hurtado C', 'Salinas MB', 'Gomes TS', 'Angulo S', 'Salso S', 'Pelaez J', 'Tejeda MI', 'Alhambra A', 'Gómez C', 'Enríquez A', 'Estirado E', 'Fenoy S', 'Del Aguila C']",2016,11,7,PLoS One,"Vaccaro L, et al.

27437406,Modulation of Stat-1 in Human Macrophages Infected with Different Species of Intracellular Pathogenic Bacteria.,"The infection of human macrophages by pathogenic bacteria induces different signaling pathways depending on the type of cellular receptors involved in the microorganism entry and on their mechanism(s) of survival and replication in the host cell. It was reported that Stat proteins play an important role in this process. In the present study, we investigate the changes in Stat-1 activation (phosphorylation in p-tyr701) after uptake of two Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium and Legionella pneumophila) characterized by their varying abilities to enter, survive, and replicate in human macrophages. Comparing the results obtained with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, Stat-1 activation in macrophages does not seem to be related to LPS content. The p-tyr701Stat-1 expression levels were found to be independent of the internalized bacterial number and IFN-γ release. On the contrary, Jak/Stat-1 pathway activation only occurs when an active infection has been established in the host macrophage, and it is plausible that the differences in the expression levels of p-tyr701Stat-1 could be due to different survival mechanisms or to differences in bacteria life cycles within macrophages.","['Schiavano GF', 'Dominici S', 'Rinaldi L', 'Cangiano AM', 'Brandi G', 'Magnani M']",2016,2016,,J Immunol Res,"Schiavano GF, et al.

27436892,Direct targeting of membrane fusion by SNARE mimicry: Convergent evolution of Legionella effectors.,"Legionella pneumophila, the Gram-negative pathogen causing Legionnaires' disease, infects host cells by hijacking endocytic pathways and forming a Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) in which the bacteria replicate. To promote LCV expansion and prevent lysosomal targeting, effector proteins are translocated into the host cell where they alter membrane traffic. Here we show that three of these effectors [LegC2 (Legionella eukaryotic-like gene C2)/YlfB (yeast lethal factor B), LegC3, and LegC7/YlfA] functionally mimic glutamine (Q)-SNARE proteins. In infected cells, the three proteins selectively form complexes with the endosomal arginine (R)-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP4). When reconstituted in proteoliposomes, these proteins avidly fuse with liposomes containing VAMP4, resulting in a stable complex with properties resembling canonical SNARE complexes. Intriguingly, however, the LegC/SNARE hybrid complex cannot be disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. We conclude that LegCs use SNARE mimicry to divert VAMP4-containing vesicles for fusion with the LCV, thus promoting its expansion. In addition, the LegC/VAMP4 complex avoids the host's disassembly machinery, thus effectively trapping VAMP4 in an inactive state.","['Shi X', 'Halder P', 'Yavuz H', 'Jahn R', 'Shuman HA']",2016,113,31,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Shi X, et al.

27427481,Structural Determinants Defining the Allosteric Inhibition of an Essential Antibiotic Target.,"Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) catalyzes the first committed step in the lysine biosynthesis pathway of bacteria. The pathway can be regulated by feedback inhibition of DHDPS through the allosteric binding of the end product, lysine. The current dogma states that DHDPS from Gram-negative bacteria are inhibited by lysine but orthologs from Gram-positive species are not. The 1.65-Å resolution structure of the Gram-negative Legionella pneumophila DHDPS and the 1.88-Å resolution structure of the Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae DHDPS bound to lysine, together with comprehensive functional analyses, show that this dogma is incorrect. We subsequently employed our crystallographic data with bioinformatics, mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, and microscale thermophoresis to reveal that lysine-mediated inhibition is not defined by Gram staining, but by the presence of a His or Glu at position 56 (Escherichia coli numbering). This study has unveiled the molecular determinants defining lysine-mediated allosteric inhibition of bacterial DHDPS.","['Soares da Costa TP', 'Desbois S', 'Dogovski C', 'Gorman MA', 'Ketaren NE', 'Paxman JJ', 'Siddiqui T', 'Zammit LM', 'Abbott BM', 'Robins-Browne RM', 'Parker MW', 'Jameson GB', 'Hall NE', 'Panjikar S', 'Perugini MA']",2016,24,8,Structure,"Soares da Costa TP, et al.

The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila encodes for six proteins that contain the OmpA-like domain, among them the highly conserved uncharacterized protein we named CmpA. Here we set out to characterize the CmpA protein and determine its contribution to intracellular survival of L. pneumophila Secondary structure analysis suggests that CmpA is an inner membrane protein with a peptidoglycan-binding domain at the C-teminus. A cmpA mutant was able to replicate normally in broth, but failed to compete with an isogenic wild-type strain in an intracellular growth competition assay. The cmpA mutant also displayed significant intracellular growth defects in both the protozoan host Acanthamoeba castellanii and in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, where uptake into the cells was also impaired. The cmpA phenotypes were completely restored upon expression of CmpA in trans The data presented here establish CmpA as a novel virulence factor of L. pneumophila that is required for efficient intracellular replication in both mammalian and protozoan hosts.","['Goodwin IP', 'Kumova OK', 'Ninio S']",2016,363,16,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Goodwin IP, et al.

Quick diagnosis and prompt treatment initiation determine favorable outcome. Empirical antibiotic treatment allows to achieve treatment success in most patients. Treatment recommendations are based on big epidemiological trials. Nevertheless, it is sometimes necessary to know the definite etiologic factor of pneumonia. In these cases microbiological diagnostics is useful, i.e. sputum microscopy and culture, blood culture, bronchial lavage culture, bacterial antigen tests in urine, molecular tests. Serological tests do not help much in everyday clinical practice. The most common microorganisms causing community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are: Streptococcus pneumoniae, atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila), Haemophilus influenzae, influenza virus. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa rarely are etiologic factors of CAP. First line antibiotics in pneumonia treatment are beta - lactams. In case of allergy or intolerance of beta - lactams, new fluorochinolones should be used. Macrolides are useful if the atypical etiology is suspected.

In response to IFN signaling, GBPs are expressed in the cytoplasm of immune and nonimmune cells, where they unleash their antimicrobial activity toward intracellular bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Recent studies have revealed that GBPs are essential for mediating activation of the caspase-1 inflammasome in response to the gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Francisella novicida, Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio cholerae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter koseri During infection with vacuolar-restricted gram-negative bacteria, GBPs disrupt the vacuolar membrane to ensure liberation of LPS for cytoplasmic detection by caspase-11 and the noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome. In response to certain cytosolic bacteria, GBPs liberate microbial DNA for activation of the DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome. GBPs also promote the recruitment of antimicrobial proteins, including NADPH oxidase subunits and autophagy-associated proteins to the Mycobacterium-containing vacuole to mediate intracellular bacterial killing. Here, we provide an overview on the emerging relationship between GBPs and activation of the inflammasome in innate immunity to microbial pathogens.","['Man SM', 'Place DE', 'Kuriakose T', 'Kanneganti TD']",2017,101,1,J Leukoc Biol,"Man SM, et al.

27417291,Age-related risk factors for bacterial aetiology in community-acquired pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of age and comorbidities, smoking and alcohol use on microorganisms in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
METHODS: A prospective multicentre study was performed with 4304 patients. We compared microbiological results, bacterial aetiology, smoking, alcohol abuse and comorbidities in three age groups: young adults (<45 years), adults (45-64 years) and seniors (>65 years).
RESULTS: Bacterial aetiology was identified in 1522 (35.4%) patients. In seniors, liver disease was independently associated with Gram-negative bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae), COPD with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR = 2.69 (1.46-4.97)) and Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 2.8 (1.24-6.3)) and neurological diseases with S. aureus. In adults, diabetes mellitus (DM) was a risk factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. aureus, and COPD for H. influenzae (OR = 3.39 (1.06-10.83)). In young adults, DM was associated with S. aureus. Smoking was a risk factor for Legionella pneumophila regardless of age. Alcohol intake was associated with mixed aetiology and Coxiella burnetii in seniors, and with S. pneumoniae in young adults.
CONCLUSION: It should be considered that the bacterial aetiology may differ according to the patient's age, comorbidities, smoking and alcohol abuse. More extensive microbiological testing is warranted in those with risk factors for infrequent microorganisms.","['Sahuquillo-Arce JM', 'Menéndez R', 'Méndez R', 'Amara-Elori I', 'Zalacain R', 'Capelastegui A', 'Aspa J', 'Borderías L', 'Martín-Villasclaras JJ', 'Bello S', 'Alfageme I', 'de Castro FR', 'Rello J', 'Molinos L', 'Ruiz-Manzano J', 'Torres A']",2016,21,8,Respirology,"Sahuquillo-Arce JM, et al.

27412543,"[Distribution characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila in hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection: an analysis of 13 198 cases].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), and Legionella pneumophila (LP) in hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI).
METHODS: A total of 13 198 hospitalized children with ARTI were enrolled as study subjects. Whole blood and urine were collected. The passive agglutination was used to detect serum MP-IgM, ELISA was used to detect serum CP-IgM, and immunochromatography was performed to detect urinary LP antigen.
RESULTS: Among the 13 198 hospitalized ARTI children, the detection rates of MP, CP, and LP were 25.31%, 12.74% and 3.27%, suggesting that MP had the highest detection rate (P<0.0125). The detection rates of MP in 2013 and 2014 were significantly higher than that in 2012 (P<0.0125). CP had the highest detection rate in 2013, and LP had the highest detection rate in 2014 (P<0.0125). These three pathogens were detected all around the year, and MP had the highest detection rate in all seasons (P<0.0125). The detection rate of mixed infection with three pathogens was 4.35%, and mixed infection with MP and CP was the most common (P<0.0071). Among the children in different age groups, the patients aged 5-16 years showed the highest overall detection rate of three pathogens (P<0.0071).

27412167,Thinking beside the box: Should we care about the non-coding strand of the 16S rRNA gene?,"The 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) codes for RNA that plays a fundamental role during translation in the ribosome and is used extensively as a marker gene to establish relationships among bacteria. However, the complementary non-coding 16S rDNA (nc16S rDNA) has been ignored. An idea emerged in the course of analyzing bacterial 16S rDNA sequences in search for nucleotide composition and substitution patterns: Does the nc16S rDNA code? If so, what does it code for? More importantly: Does 16S rDNA evolution reflect its own evolution or the evolution of its counterpart nc16S rDNA? The objective of this minireview is to discuss these thoughts. nc strands often encode small RNAs (sRNAs), ancient components of gene regulation. nc16S rDNA sequences from different bacterial groups were used to search for possible matches in the Bacterial Small Regulatory RNA Database. Intriguingly, the sequence of one published sRNA obtained from Legionella pneumophila (GenBank: AE0173541) showed high non-random similarity with nc16S rDNA corresponding in part to the V5 region especially from Legionella and relatives. While the target(s) of this sRNA is unclear at the moment, its mere existence might open up a new chapter in the use of the 16S rDNA to study relationships among bacteria.","['Garcia-Mazcorro JF', 'Barcenas-Walls JR']",2016,363,16,FEMS Microbiol Lett,Garcia-Mazcorro JF and Barcenas-Walls JR.

Serogroups of L. pneumophila isolated in 2007 were distributed among serogroups (sgs) 1-7 with the exception of sg 4, while those of isolates during 2013 and 2014 included also 11 sgs ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15). L. pneumophila sg 1 was predominated among isolates from fountains (75%), hotels (60%), buildings (44%), hospitals (38%), and public baths (37%), whereas sg 3 and sg 7 was the most prevalent from ships (46%) and factories (40%), respectively. The predominated serogroup of L. pneumophila isolates from hot and cooling tower water was sg 1 (35% and 46%, respectively), while from cold water was sg 3 (29%).

27404583,Unraveling the Phosphocholination Mechanism of the Legionella pneumophila Enzyme AnkX.,"The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila infects lung macrophages and injects numerous effector proteins into the host cell to establish a vacuole for proliferation. The necessary interference with vesicular trafficking of the host is achieved by modulation of the function of Rab GTPases. The effector protein AnkX chemically modifies Rab1b and Rab35 by covalent phosphocholination of serine or threonine residues using CDP-choline as a donor. So far, the phosphoryl transfer mechanism and the relevance of observed autophosphocholination of AnkX remained disputable. We designed tailored caged compounds to make this type of enzymatic reaction accessible for time-resolved Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy. By combining spectroscopic and biochemical methods, we determined that full length AnkX is autophosphocholinated at Ser521, Thr620, and Thr943. However, autophosphocholination loses specificity for these sites in shortened constructs and does not appear to be relevant for the catalysis of the phosphoryl transfer. In contrast, transient phosphocholination of His229 in the conserved catalytic motif might exist as a short-lived reaction intermediate. Upon substrate binding, His229 is deprotonated and locked in this state, being rendered capable of a nucleophilic attack on the pyrophosphate moiety of the substrate. The proton that originated from His229 is transferred to a nearby carboxylic acid residue. Thus, our combined findings support a ping-pong mechanism involving phosphocholination of His229 and subsequent transfer of phosphocholine to the Rab GTPase. Our approach can be extended to the investigation of further nucleotidyl transfer reactions, which are currently of reemerging interest in regulatory pathways of host-pathogen interactions.","['Gavriljuk K', 'Schartner J', 'Seidel H', 'Dickhut C', 'Zahedi RP', 'Hedberg C', 'Kötting C', 'Gerwert K']",2016,55,31,Biochemistry,"Gavriljuk K, et al.

Targeted antibiotic therapy (TAT) for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with positive urinary antigen test (UAT) has been associated with a favorable impact on outcome. We aimed to determine the factors associated with TAT prescription.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study including all patients presenting with CAP and positive UAT for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila from January 2010 to December 2013. Patients presenting with aspiration pneumonia, coinfection, and neutropenia were excluded. CAP severity was assessed using the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). TAT was defined as the administration of amoxicillin for pneumococcal infection and either macrolides or fluoroquinolones (inactive against S. pneumoniae) for Legionella infection.
RESULTS: A total of 861 patients were included, including 687 pneumococcal infections and 174 legionellosis from eight facilities and 37 medical departments. TAT was prescribed to 273 patients (32%). Four factors were found independently associated with a lower rate of TAT: a PSI score≥4 (OR 0.37), Hospital A (OR 0.41), hospitalization in the intensive care unit (OR 0.44), and cardiac comorbidities (OR 0.60). Four other factors were associated with a high rate of TAT: positive blood culture for S. pneumoniae (OR 2.32), Hospitals B (OR 2.34), E (OR 2.68), and H (OR 9.32).

However, until now there is limited knowledge about the factors that promote Legionella's growth in such systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical wastewater parameters that might be correlated to the concentration of Legionella spp. in WWTP receiving industrial effluents. For this purpose, samples were collected at different processes in three WWTP. In 100 % of the samples taken from the activated sludge tanks Legionella spp. were detected at varying concentrations (4.8 to 5.6 log GU/mL) by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method, but not by the culture method. Statistical analysis with various parameters yielded positive correlations of Legionella spp. concentration with particulate chemical oxygen demand, Kjeldahl nitrogen and protein concentration. Amino acids were quantified in wastewater and activated sludge samples at concentrations that may not support the growth of Legionella, suggesting that in activated sludge tanks this bacterium multiplied in protozoan hosts.","['Caicedo C', 'Beutel S', 'Scheper T', 'Rosenwinkel KH', 'Nogueira R']",2016,23,16,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Caicedo C, et al.

27337459,Hospital-Associated Infections.,"Hospital-associated infection (HAI) in immunocompromised patients can result in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are especially worrisome because of the limited choice of remaining antibiotics available when a patient becomes colonized or infected with an MDRO. It is therefore important that immunocompromised patients be cared for in an environment that limits the risk for acquiring infections. However, with healthcare being increasingly delivered in settings other than the traditional inpatient hospital wards, a bigger effort will need to be set forth to prevent or rapidly diagnose HAI. The last few years have seen a significant increase in the number of singleplex and multiplex molecular assays for the detection of many of the organisms responsible for HAI, but more is needed as infections caused by organisms like Legionella pneumophila and Aspergillus species are still diagnosed with methods that have relatively low yield and are slow to provide actionable results. Finally, the use of novel techniques for outbreak investigations will provide new information on transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings and allow stronger, evidence-based recommendations to be developed for prevention of HAIs in the immunocompromised host.",['Babady NE'],2016,4,3,Microbiol Spectr,Babady NE.

27337278,Intracellular Growth of Bacterial Pathogens: The Role of Secreted Effector Proteins in the Control of Phagocytosed Microorganisms.,"The ability of intracellular pathogens to subvert the host response, to facilitate invasion and subsequent infection, is the hallmark of microbial pathogenesis. Bacterial pathogens produce and secrete a variety of effector proteins, which are the primary means by which they exert control over the host cell. Secreted effectors work independently, yet in concert with each other, to facilitate microbial invasion, replication, and intracellular survival in host cells. In this review we focus on defined host cell processes targeted by bacterial pathogens. These include phagosome maturation and its subprocesses: phagosome-endosome and phagosome-lysosome fusion events, as well as phagosomal acidification, cytoskeleton remodeling, and lysis of the phagosomal membrane. We further describe the mode of action for selected effectors from six pathogens: the Gram-negative Legionella, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, the Gram-positive Listeria, and the acid-fast actinomycete Mycobacterium.","['Poirier V', 'Av-Gay Y']",2015,3,6,Microbiol Spectr,Poirier V and Av-Gay Y.

27334731,Prevalence of Pulmonary Infections Caused by Atypical Pathogens in non-HIV Immunocompromised Patients.,"Although atypical bacteria are important causes of lower airway infections, data on their role in immunocompromised patients are scarce. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of atypical pulmonary infections in patients with various types of immunosuppression, and to analyze clinical characteristics of these infections. Eighty non-HIV immunocompromised patients with different underlying diseases and clinical and radiological signs of pulmonary infection were enrolled. Due to incomplete data on eight patients, 72 patients were eligible for final analysis (median age 58 years). All patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) fluid samples were sent for direct microscopy, cultures, and fungal antigen detection, when appropriate. Commercial qualitative amplification assay (PNEUMOTRIS oligomix Alert Kit(®)), based on nested PCR method, was used to detect specific DNA sequences of L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae in BALF. There were 61 (84.7 %) patients with hematologic diseases, 3 (4.2 %) after solid organ transplantation, and 8 (11.1 %) with miscellaneous diseases affecting immune status. Specific sequences of M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila DNA were found in 7 (9.7 %), 2 (2.8 %), and 0 patients, respectively. In 8 of these patients co-infections with different microorganisms were demonstrated. Co-infection with A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa was diagnosed in three patients who died. We conclude that atypical lower airway infections are uncommon in immunocompromised patients.

27322334,Legionella pneumophila Carbonic Anhydrases: Underexplored Antibacterial Drug Targets.,"Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. Many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the α-, β-, and/or γ-CA families. In the last decade, enzymes from some of these pathogens, including Legionella pneumophila, have been cloned and characterized in detail. These enzymes were shown to be efficient catalysts for CO₂ hydration, with kcat values in the range of (3.4-8.3) × 10⁵ s(-1) and kcat/KM values of (4.7-8.5) × 10⁷ M(-1)·s(-1). In vitro inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates, were also reported for the two β-CAs from this pathogen, LpCA1 and LpCA2. Inorganic anions were millimolar inhibitors, whereas diethyldithiocarbamate, sulfamate, sulfamide, phenylboronic acid, and phenylarsonic acid were micromolar ones. The best LpCA1 inhibitors were aminobenzolamide and structurally similar sulfonylated aromatic sulfonamides, as well as acetazolamide and ethoxzolamide (KIs in the range of 40.3-90.5 nM). The best LpCA2 inhibitors belonged to the same class of sulfonylated sulfonamides, together with acetazolamide, methazolamide, and dichlorophenamide (KIs in the range of 25.2-88.5 nM). Considering such preliminary results, the two bacterial CAs from this pathogen represent promising yet underexplored targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems common to most of the clinically used antibiotics, but further studies are needed to validate them in vivo as drug targets.",['Supuran CT'],2016,5,2,Pathogens,Supuran CT.

27317257,"Atypical aetiology in patients hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia is associated with age, gender and season; a data-analysis on four Dutch cohorts.","BACKGROUND: Microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be categorised into viral, typical and atypical (Legionella species, Coxiella burnetii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia species). Extensive microbiological testing to identify the causative microorganism is not standardly recommended, and empiric treatment does not always cover atypical pathogens. In order to optimize epidemiologic knowledge of CAP and to improve empiric antibiotic choice, we investigated whether atypical microorganisms are associated with a particular season or with the patient characteristics age, gender, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: A data-analysis was performed on databases from four prospective studies, which all included adult patients hospitalised with CAP in the Netherlands (N = 980). All studies performed extensive microbiological testing.
RESULTS: A main causative agent was identified in 565/980 (57.7 %) patients. Of these, 117 (20.7 %) were atypical microorganisms. This percentage was 40.4 % (57/141) during the non-respiratory season (week 20 to week 39, early May to early October), and 67.2 % (41/61) for patients under the age of 60 during this season. Factors that were associated with atypical causative agents were: CAP acquired in the non-respiratory season (odds ratio (OR) 4.3, 95 % CI 2.68-6.84), age <60 year (OR 2.9, 95 % CI 1.83-4.66), male gender (OR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.06-2.71) and absence of COPD (OR 0.2, 95 % CI 0.12-0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Atypical causative agents in CAP are associated with respectively non-respiratory season, age <60 years, male gender and absence of COPD. Therefore, to maximise its yield, extensive microbiological testing should be considered in patients <60 years old who are admitted with CAP from early May to early October.

27315603,Characterization of the structure and catalytic activity of Legionella pneumophila VipF.,"The pathogenic bacteria Legionella pneumophila is known to cause Legionnaires' Disease, a severe pneumonia that can be fatal to immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. Shohdy et al. identified the L. pneumophila vacuole sorting inhibitory protein VipF as a putative N-acetyltransferase based on sequence homology. We have characterized the basic structural and functional properties of VipF to confirm this original functional assignment. Sequence conservation analysis indicates two putative CoA-binding regions within VipF. Homology modeling and small angle X-ray scattering suggest a monomeric, dual-domain structure joined by a flexible linker. Each domain contains the characteristic beta-splay motif found in many acetyltransferases, suggesting that VipF may contain two active sites. Docking experiments suggest reasonable acetyl-CoA binding locations within each beta-splay motif. Broad substrate screening indicated that VipF is capable of acetylating chloramphenicol and both domains are catalytically active. Given that chloramphenicol is not known to be N-acetylated, this is a surprising finding suggesting that VipF is capable of O-acetyltransferase activity.

The main aim of our study was to determine the value of PCR for the diagnosis of LD in routine clinical practice.
METHODS: In a prospective study, from March 2007 to April 2010, the value of PCR on non-invasive respiratory specimens (NIRS) was compared to those of the other available tools for LD diagnosis in patients hospitalized for pneumonia.
RESULTS: Among 254 consecutive cases of pneumonia included, 24 cases were LD (19 confirmed and 5 probable) representing the first documented microbiological etiology. Molecular diagnosis of LD was performed on NIRS by using 16S rRNA PCR, and secondarily mip PCR, with no discrepant results between the 2 methods: it was found positive in 14 cases and led to identify 2 supplementary probable cases of LD. Based on clinical and at least 2 positive LD tests, PCR yielded a better diagnostic value than antigen urinary test (12 vs 10 cases).
CONCLUSION: These results revealed that molecular diagnosis of LD on NIRS is reliable and may contribute to better identify cases of LD.","['Botelho-Nevers E', 'Grattard F', 'Viallon A', 'Allegra S', 'Jarraud S', 'Verhoeven P', 'Marcuccilli A', 'Lucht F', 'Pozzetto B', 'Berthelot P']",2016,73,2,J Infect,"Botelho-Nevers E, et al.

27300652,Cooperation between Monocyte-Derived Cells and Lymphoid Cells in the Acute Response to a Bacterial Lung Pathogen.,"Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, a potentially fatal lung infection. Alveolar macrophages support intracellular replication of L. pneumophila, however the contributions of other immune cell types to bacterial killing during infection are unclear. Here, we used recently described methods to characterise the major inflammatory cells in lung after acute respiratory infection of mice with L. pneumophila. We observed that the numbers of alveolar macrophages rapidly decreased after infection coincident with a rapid infiltration of the lung by monocyte-derived cells (MC), which, together with neutrophils, became the dominant inflammatory cells associated with the bacteria. Using mice in which the ability of MC to infiltrate tissues is impaired it was found that MC were required for bacterial clearance and were the major source of IL12. IL12 was needed to induce IFNγ production by lymphoid cells including NK cells, memory T cells, NKT cells and γδ T cells. Memory T cells that produced IFNγ appeared to be circulating effector/memory T cells that infiltrated the lung after infection. IFNγ production by memory T cells was stimulated in an antigen-independent fashion and could effectively clear bacteria from the lung indicating that memory T cells are an important contributor to innate bacterial defence. We also determined that a major function of IFNγ was to stimulate bactericidal activity of MC. On the other hand, neutrophils did not require IFNγ to kill bacteria and alveolar macrophages remained poorly bactericidal even in the presence of IFNγ. This work has revealed a cooperative innate immune circuit between lymphoid cells and MC that combats acute L. pneumophila infection and defines a specific role for IFNγ in anti-bacterial immunity.","['Brown AS', 'Yang C', 'Fung KY', 'Bachem A', 'Bourges D', 'Bedoui S', 'Hartland EL', 'van Driel IR']",2016,12,6,PLoS Pathog,"Brown AS, et al.

27293110,Comparison of pulsed corona plasma and pulsed electric fields for the decontamination of water containing Legionella pneumophila as model organism.,"Pulsed corona plasma and pulsed electric fields were assessed for their capacity to kill Legionella pneumophila in water. Electrical parameters such as in particular dissipated energy were equal for both treatments. This was accomplished by changing the polarity of the applied high voltage pulses in a coaxial electrode geometry resulting in the generation of corona plasma or an electric field. For corona plasma, generated by high voltage pulses with peak voltages of +80kV, Legionella were completely killed, corresponding to a log-reduction of 5.4 (CFU/ml) after a treatment time of 12.5min. For the application of pulsed electric fields from peak voltages of -80kV a survival of log 2.54 (CFU/ml) was still detectable after this treatment time. Scanning electron microscopy images of L. pneumophila showed rupture of cells after plasma treatment. In contrast, the morphology of bacteria seems to be intact after application of pulsed electric fields. The more efficient killing for the same energy input observed for pulsed corona plasma is likely due to induced chemical processes and the generation of reactive species as indicated by the evolution of hydrogen peroxide. This suggests that the higher efficacy and efficiency of pulsed corona plasma is primarily associated with the combined effect of the applied electric fields and the promoted reaction chemistry.","['Banaschik R', 'Burchhardt G', 'Zocher K', 'Hammerschmidt S', 'Kolb JF', 'Weltmann KD']",2016,112,,Bioelectrochemistry,"Banaschik R, et al.

27288243,Legionella-protozoa-nematode interactions in aquatic biofilms and influence of Mip on Caenorhabditis elegans colonization.,"Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaireś disease, is naturally found in aquatic habitats. The intracellular life cycle within protozoa pre-adapted the ""accidental"" human pathogen to also infect human professional phagocytes like alveolar macrophages. Previous studies employing the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that also nematodes might serve as a natural host for L. pneumophila. Here, we report for the first time from a natural co-habitation of L. pneumophila and environmental nematode species within biofilms of a warm water spring. In addition, we identified the protozoan species Oxytricha bifaria, Stylonychia mytilus, Ciliophrya sp. which have never been described as potential interaction partners of L. pneumophila before. Modeling and dissection of the Legionella-protozoa-nematode interaction revealed that C. elegans ruptures Legionella-infected amoebal cells and by this means incorporate the pathogen. Further infection studies revealed that the macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip) protein of L. pneumophila, which is known to bind collagen IV during human lung infection, promotes the colonization of the intestinal tract of L4 larvae of C. elegans and negatively influences the life span of the worms. The Mip-negative L. pneumophila mutant exhibited a 32-fold reduced colonization rate of the nematodes after 48h when compared to the wild-type strain. Taken together, these studies suggest that nematodes may serve as natural hosts for L. pneumophila, promote their persistence and dissemination in the environment, and co-evolutionarily pre-adapt the pathogen for interactions with extracellular constituents of human lung tissue.","['Rasch J', 'Krüger S', 'Fontvieille D', 'Ünal CM', 'Michel R', 'Labrosse A', 'Steinert M']",2016,306,6,Int J Med Microbiol,"Rasch J, et al.

27287324,Metabolism of myo-Inositol by Legionella pneumophila Promotes Infection of Amoebae and Macrophages.,"UNLABELLED: Legionella pneumophila is a natural parasite of environmental amoebae and the causative agent of a severe pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. The facultative intracellular pathogen employs a bipartite metabolism, where the amino acid serine serves as the major energy supply, while glycerol and glucose are mainly utilized for anabolic processes. The L. pneumophila genome harbors the cluster lpg1653 to lpg1649 putatively involved in the metabolism of the abundant carbohydrate myo-inositol (here termed inositol). To assess inositol metabolism by L. pneumophila, we constructed defined mutant strains lacking lpg1653 or lpg1652, which are predicted to encode the inositol transporter IolT or the inositol-2-dehydrogenase IolG, respectively. The mutant strains were not impaired for growth in complex or defined minimal media, and inositol did not promote extracellular growth. However, upon coinfection of Acanthamoeba castellanii, the mutants were outcompeted by the parental strain, indicating that the intracellular inositol metabolism confers a fitness advantage to the pathogen. Indeed, inositol added to L. pneumophila-infected amoebae or macrophages promoted intracellular growth of the parental strain, but not of the ΔiolT or ΔiolG mutant, and growth stimulation by inositol was restored by complementation of the mutant strains. The expression of the Piol promoter and bacterial uptake of inositol required the alternative sigma factor RpoS, a key virulence regulator of L. pneumophila Finally, the parental strain and ΔiolG mutant bacteria but not the ΔiolT mutant strain accumulated [U-(14)C6]inositol, indicating that IolT indeed functions as an inositol transporter. Taken together, intracellular L. pneumophila metabolizes inositol through the iol gene products, thus promoting the growth and virulence of the pathogen.
IMPORTANCE: The environmental bacterium Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of a severe pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. The opportunistic pathogen replicates in protozoan and mammalian phagocytes in a unique vacuole. Amino acids are thought to represent the prime source of carbon and energy for L. pneumophila However, genome, transcriptome, and proteome studies indicate that the pathogen not only utilizes amino acids as carbon sources but possesses broader metabolic capacities. In this study, we analyzed the metabolism of inositol by extra- and intracellularly growing L. pneumophila By using genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, we found that L. pneumophila accumulates and metabolizes inositol through the iol gene products, thus promoting the intracellular growth, virulence, and fitness of the pathogen. Our study significantly contributes to an understanding of the intracellular niche of a human pathogen.","['Manske C', 'Schell U', 'Hilbi H']",2016,82,16,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Manske C, et al.

In this study, various whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based methods were evaluated according to published guidelines, including (i) a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based method, (ii) extended MLST using different numbers of genes, (iii) determination of gene presence or absence, and (iv) a kmer-based method. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates (n = 106) from the standard ""typing panel,"" previously used by the European Society for Clinical Microbiology Study Group on Legionella Infections (ESGLI), were tested together with another 229 isolates. Over 98% of isolates were considered typeable using the SNP- and kmer-based methods. Percentages of isolates with complete extended MLST profiles ranged from 99.1% (50 genes) to 86.8% (1,455 genes), while only 41.5% produced a full profile with the gene presence/absence scheme. Replicates demonstrated that all methods offer 100% reproducibility. Indices of discrimination range from 0.972 (ribosomal MLST) to 0.999 (SNP based), and all values were higher than that achieved with SBT (0.940). Epidemiological concordance is generally inversely related to discriminatory power. We propose that an extended MLST scheme with ∼50 genes provides optimal epidemiological concordance while substantially improving the discrimination offered by SBT and can be used as part of a hierarchical typing scheme that should maintain backwards compatibility and increase discrimination where necessary. This analysis will be useful for the ESGLI to design a scheme that has the potential to become the new gold standard typing method for L. pneumophila.","['David S', 'Mentasti M', 'Tewolde R', 'Aslett M', 'Harris SR', 'Afshar B', 'Underwood A', 'Fry NK', 'Parkhill J', 'Harrison TG']",2016,54,8,J Clin Microbiol,"David S, et al.

27276986,Community-acquired pneumonia related to intracellular pathogens.,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide; the annual incidence of CAP among adults in Europe has ranged from 1.5 to 1.7 per 1000 population. Intracellular bacteria are common causes of CAP. However, there is considerable variation in the reported incidence between countries and change over time. The intracellular pathogens that are well established as causes of pneumonia are Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, and Coxiella burnetii. Since it is known that antibiotic treatment for severe CAP is empiric and includes coverage of typical and atypical pathogens, microbiological diagnosis bears an important relationship to prognosis of pneumonia. Factors such as adequacy of initial antibiotic or early de-escalation of therapy are important variables associated with outcomes, especially in severe cases. Intracellular pathogens sometimes appear to cause more severe disease with respiratory failure and multisystem dysfunction associated with fatal outcomes. The clinical relevance of intracellular pathogens in severe CAP has not been specifically investigated. We review the prevalence, general characteristics, and outcomes of severe CAP cases caused by intracellular pathogens.","['Cillóniz C', 'Torres A', 'Niederman M', 'van der Eerden M', 'Chalmers J', 'Welte T', 'Blasi F']",2016,42,9,Intensive Care Med,"Cillóniz C, et al.

Water samples were analyzed for the protozoa Giardia and Cryptosporidium (EPA Method 1623); the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus terreus (quantitative PCR [qPCR]); and the bacteria Legionella pneumophila (qPCR), Mycobacterium avium, M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis, and Mycobacterium intracellulare (qPCR and culture). Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected in 25% and in 46% of the source water samples, respectively (treated waters were not tested). Aspergillus fumigatus was the most commonly detected fungus in source waters (48%) but none of the three fungi were detected in treated water. Legionella pneumophila was detected in 25% of the source water samples but in only 4% of treated water samples. M. avium and M. intracellulare were both detected in 25% of source water, while all three mycobacteria were detected in 36% of treated water samples. Five species of mycobacteria, Mycobacterium mucogenicum, Mycobacterium phocaicum, Mycobacterium triplex, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium lentiflavum were cultured from treated water samples. Although these DWTPs represent a fraction of those in the U.S., the results suggest that many of these pathogens are widespread in source waters but that treatment is generally effective in reducing them to below detection limits. The one exception is the mycobacteria, which were commonly detected in treated water, even when not detected in source waters.","['King DN', 'Donohue MJ', 'Vesper SJ', 'Villegas EN', 'Ware MW', 'Vogel ME', 'Furlong EF', 'Kolpin DW', 'Glassmeyer ST', 'Pfaller S']",2016,562,,Sci Total Environ,"King DN, et al.

In this study, we report an analysis of the arrangement of subunits in Listeria monocytogenes GpsB by small-angle X-ray scattering. The resulting model has an elongated shape with residues critical for interaction with PBP1 and the cell membrane clustered at one end of the molecule. Mutations that destabilize the hexameric assembly of the wild-type protein have a gpsB null phenotype, indicating that oligomerization is critical for the correct function of GpsB. We suggest a model in which a single GpsB hexamer can interact with multiple PBP1 molecules and can therefore influence the arrangement of PBP1 molecules within the cell division machinery, a dynamic multiprotein complex called the divisome, consistent with a role for GpsB in modulating the synthesis of the cell wall.","['Cleverley RM', 'Rismondo J', 'Lockhart-Cairns MP', 'Van Bentum PT', 'Egan AJ', 'Vollmer W', 'Halbedel S', 'Baldock C', 'Breukink E', 'Lewis RJ']",2016,22,6,Microb Drug Resist,"Cleverley RM, et al.

27243279,Improving the Diagnosis of Legionella Pneumonia within a Healthcare System through a Systematic Consultation and Testing Program.,"RATIONALE: Legionella testing is not recommended for all patients with pneumonia, but rather for particular patient subgroups. As a result, the overall incidence of Legionella pneumonia may be underestimated.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of Legionella pneumonia in a veteran population in an endemic area after introduction of a systematic infectious diseases consultation and testing program.
METHODS: In response to a 2011-2012 outbreak, the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System mandated infectious diseases consultations and testing for Legionella by urine antigen and sputum culture in all patients with pneumonia.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between January 2013 and December 2015, 1,579 cases of pneumonia were identified. The incidence of pneumonia was 788/100,000 veterans per year, including 352/100,000 veterans per year and 436/100,000 veterans per year with community-associated pneumonia (CAP) and health care-associated pneumonia, respectively. Ninety-eight percent of patients with suspected pneumonia were tested for Legionella by at least one method. Legionella accounted for 1% of pneumonia cases (n = 16), including 1.7% (12/706) and 0.6% (4/873) of CAP and health care-associated pneumonia, respectively. The yearly incidences of Legionella pneumonia and Legionella CAP were 7.99 and 5.99/100,000 veterans, respectively. The sensitivities of urine antigen and sputum culture were 81% and 60%, respectively; the specificity of urine antigen was >99.97%. Urine antigen testing and Legionella cultures increased by 65% and 330%, respectively, after introduction of our program.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic testing of veterans in an endemic area revealed a higher incidence of Legionella pneumonia and CAP than previously reported. Widespread urine antigen testing was not limited by false positivity.","['Decker BK', 'Harris PL', 'Muder RR', 'Hong JH', 'Singh N', 'Sonel AF', 'Clancy CJ']",2016,13,8,Ann Am Thorac Soc,"Decker BK, et al.

27242974,F. novicida-Infected A. castellanii Does Not Enhance Bacterial Virulence in Mice.,"Francisella tularensis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that causes tularemia in humans and animals. Epidemiology of tularemia worldwide is often associated with water-borne transmission, which includes mosquitoes and amoebae as the potential host reservoirs of the bacteria in water environment. In vitro studies showed intracellular replication of F. tularensis within Acanthamoeba castellanii and Hartmanella vermiformis cells. While infection of amoeba by Legionella pneumophila has been shown to enhance infectivity of L. pneumophila the role of F. tularensis-infected protozoa in the pathogenesis of tularemia is not known. We used 6 h coculture of A. castellanii and F. novicida for investigation of the effect of inhaled amoeba on the pathogenesis of tularemia on in vivo model. Balb/c mice were infected intratracheally with F. novicida or with F. novicida-infected A. castellanii. Surprisingly, infection with F. novicida-infected A. castellanii did not lead to bronchopneumonia in Balb/c mice, and Francisella did not disseminate into the liver and spleen. Upon inhalation, F. novicida infects a variety of host cells, though neutrophils are the predominant cells early during infection in the lung infiltrates of pulmonary tularemia. The numbers of neutrophils in the lungs of Balb/c mice were significantly lower in the infection of mice with F. novicida-infected A. castellanii in comparison to group of mice infected only with F. novicida. These results demonstrate that following inoculation of mice with F. novicida-infected A. castellanii, mice did not develop tularemia.","['Ozanic M', 'Gobin I', 'Brezovec M', 'Marecic V', 'Trobonjaca Z', 'Abu Kwaik Y', 'Santic M']",2016,6,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Ozanic M, et al.

Dose-response and time-dose-response (TDR) models were generated for Legionella longbeachae exposure to mice via the intratracheal route using a maximum likelihood estimation approach. The best-fit TDR model was then incorporated into two L. pneumophila outbreak models: an outbreak that occurred at a spa in Japan, and one that occurred in a Melbourne aquarium. The best-fit TDR from the murine dosing study was the beta-Poisson with exponential-reciprocal dependency model, which had a minimized deviance of 32.9. This model was tested against other incubation distributions in the Japan outbreak, and performed consistently well, with reported deviances ranging from 32 to 35. In the case of the Melbourne outbreak, the exponential model with exponential dependency was tested against non-time-dependent distributions to explore the performance of the time-dependent model with the lowest number of parameters. This model reported low minimized deviances around 8 for the Weibull, gamma, and lognormal exposure distribution cases. This work shows that the incorporation of a time factor into outbreak distributions provides models with acceptable fits that can provide insight into the in vivo dynamics of the host-pathogen system.","['Prasad B', 'Hamilton KA', 'Haas CN']",2017,37,2,Risk Anal,"Prasad B, et al.

27194016,Evaluation of the microbiological quality of reclaimed water produced from a lagooning system.,"The use of lagooning as a complementary natural method of treating secondary effluents of wastewater treatment plants has been employed as an affordable and easy means of producing reclaimed water. However, using reclaimed water for some purposes, for example, for food irrigation, presents some risks if the effluents contain microbial pathogens. Classical bacterial indicators that are used to assess faecal contamination in water do not always properly indicate the presence of bacterial or viral pathogens. In the current study, the presence of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB), heterotrophic bacterial counts (HBC), pathogens and opportunistic pathogens, such as Legionella spp., Aeromonas spp., Arcobacter spp., free-living amoeba (FLA), several viral indicators (human adenovirus and polyomavirus JC) and viral pathogens (noroviruses and hepatitis E virus) were analysed for 1 year in inlet and outlet water to assess the removal efficiency of a lagooning system. We observed 2.58 (1.17-4.59) and 1.65 (0.15-3.14) log reductions in Escherichia coli (EC) and intestinal enterococci (IE), respectively, between the inlet and outlet samples. Genomic copies of the viruses were log reduced by 1.18 (0.24-2.93), 0.64 (0.12-1.97), 0.45 (0.04-2.54) and 0.72 (0.22-2.50) for human adenovirus (HAdV), JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) and human noroviruses (NoV GI and GII), respectively. No regrowth of opportunistic pathogens was observed within the system. FLA, detected in all samples, did not show a clear trend. The reduction of faecal pathogens was irregular with 6 out of 12 samples and 4 out of 12 samples exceeding the EC and IE values, specified in the Spanish legislation for reclaimed water (RD 1620/2007). This data evidences that there is a need for more studies to evaluate the removal mechanisms of lagooning systems in order to optimize pathogen reduction. Moreover, surveillance of water used to irrigate raw edible vegetables should be conducted to ensure the fulfilment of the microbial requirements for the production of safe reclaimed water.","['Fernandez-Cassi X', 'Silvera C', 'Cervero-Aragó S', 'Rusiñol M', 'Latif-Eugeni F', 'Bruguera-Casamada C', 'Civit S', 'Araujo RM', 'Figueras MJ', 'Girones R', 'Bofill-Mas S']",2016,23,16,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Fernandez-Cassi X, et al.

27190244,Colony types and virulence traits of Legionella feeleii determined by exopolysaccharide materials.,"Legionella feeleii is a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium that causes Pontiac fever and pneumonia in humans. When L. feeleii serogroup 1 (ATCC 35072) was cultured on BCYE agar plates, two types of colonies were observed and exhibited differences in color, opacity and morphology. Since the two colony types are white rugose and brown translucent, they were termed as white rugose L. feeleii (WRLf) and brown translucent L. feeleii (BTLf), respectively. They exhibited different growth capacities in BYE broth in vitro, and it was found that WRLf could transform to BTLf. Under the electron microscope, it was observed that WRLf secreted materials which could be stained with ruthenium red, which was absent in BTLf. When U937 macrophages and HeLa cells were infected with the bacteria, WRLf manifested stronger internalization ability than BTLf. Intracellular growth in murine macrophages and Acanthamoeba cells was affected by the level of initial phagocytosis. WRLf was more resistant to human serum bactericidal action than BTLf. After being inoculated to guinea pigs, both organisms caused fever in the animals. These results suggest that ruthenium red-stained materials secreted in the surroundings may play a crucial role in determining L. feeleii colony morphology and virulence traits.","['Wang C', 'Saito M', 'Ogawa M', 'Yoshida S']",2016,363,10,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Wang C, et al.

27185787,Iron Limitation Triggers Early Egress by the Intracellular Bacterial Pathogen Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that replicates in alveolar macrophages, causing a severe form of pneumonia. Intracellular growth of the bacterium depends on its ability to sequester iron from the host cell. In the L. pneumophila strain 130b, one mechanism used to acquire this essential nutrient is the siderophore legiobactin. Iron-bound legiobactin is imported by the transport protein LbtU. Here, we describe the role of LbtP, a paralog of LbtU, in iron acquisition in the L. pneumophila strain Philadelphia-1. Similar to LbtU, LbtP is a siderophore transport protein and is required for robust growth under iron-limiting conditions. Despite their similar functions, however, LbtU and LbtP do not contribute equally to iron acquisition. The Philadelphia-1 strain lacking LbtP is more sensitive to iron deprivation in vitro Moreover, LbtP is important for L. pneumophila growth within macrophages while LbtU is dispensable. These results demonstrate that LbtP plays a dominant role over LbtU in iron acquisition. In contrast, loss of both LbtP and LbtU does not impair L. pneumophila growth in the amoebal host Acanthamoeba castellanii, demonstrating a host-specific requirement for the activities of these two transporters in iron acquisition. The growth defect of the ΔlbtP mutant in macrophages is not due to alterations in growth kinetics. Instead, the absence of LbtP limits L. pneumophila replication and causes bacteria to prematurely exit the host cell. These results demonstrate the existence of a preprogrammed exit strategy in response to iron limitation that allows L. pneumophila to abandon the host cell when nutrients are exhausted.","[""O'Connor TJ"", 'Zheng H', 'VanRheenen SM', 'Ghosh S', 'Cianciotto NP', 'Isberg RR']",2016,84,8,Infect Immun,"O'Connor TJ, et al.

27180896,"Molecular epidemiology, phylogeny and evolution of Legionella.","Legionella are opportunistic pathogens that develop in aquatic environments where they multiply in protozoa. When infected aerosols reach the human respiratory tract they may accidentally infect the alveolar macrophages leading to a severe pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease (LD). The ability of Legionella to survive within host-cells is strictly dependent on the Dot/Icm Type 4 Secretion System that translocates a large repertoire of effectors into the host cell cytosol. Although Legionella is a large genus comprising nearly 60 species that are worldwide distributed, only about half of them have been involved in LD cases. Strikingly, the species Legionella pneumophila alone is responsible for 90% of all LD cases. The present review summarizes the molecular approaches that are used for L. pneumophila genotyping with a major focus on the contribution of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to the investigation of local L. pneumophila outbreaks and global epidemiology studies. We report the newest knowledge regarding the phylogeny and the evolution of Legionella and then focus on virulence evolution of those Legionella species that are known to have the capacity to infect humans. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary forces and adaptation mechanisms acting on the Dot/Icm system itself as well as the role of mobile genetic elements (MGE) encoding T4ASSs and of gene duplications in the evolution of Legionella and its adaptation to different hosts and lifestyles.","['Khodr A', 'Kay E', 'Gomez-Valero L', 'Ginevra C', 'Doublet P', 'Buchrieser C', 'Jarraud S']",2016,43,,Infect Genet Evol,"Khodr A, et al.

27148204,Caspase Exploitation by Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila remains a major health concern, especially for hospitalized patients. L. pneumophila in the environment can survive extracellular or as protozoan parasite within amoeba. After human infection it efficiently replicates in alveolar macrophages without activating inflammasome assembly and cleavage of caspase-1. In contrast murine macrophages actively recognize intracellular L. pneumophila via inflammasome components which initiate pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, phagosomal maturation and pyroptotic cell death thereby leading to bacterial restriction. During this process flagellin-dependent and -independent signaling pathways trigger the canonical as well as the non-canonical inflammasome. This review describes the current knowledge about L. pneumophila-induced inflammasome pathways in permissive and restrictive host cells.","['Krause K', 'Amer AO']",2016,7,,Front Microbiol,Krause K and Amer AO.

27130431,Genome-wide Chromatin Profiling of Legionella pneumophila-Infected Human Macrophages Reveals Activation of the Probacterial Host Factor TNFAIP2.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila is a causative agent of severe pneumonia. Infection leads to a broad host cell response, as evident, for example, on the transcriptional level. Chromatin modifications, which control gene expression, play a central role in the transcriptional response to L. pneumophila
METHODS: We infected human-blood-derived macrophages (BDMs) with L. pneumophila and used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to screen for gene promoters with the activating histone 4 acetylation mark.
RESULTS: We found the promoter of tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) to be acetylated at histone H4. This factor has not been characterized in the pathology of L. pneumophila TNFAIP2 messenger RNA and protein were upregulated in response to L. pneumophila infection of human-BDMs and human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells. We showed that L. pneumophila-induced TNFAIP2 expression is dependent on the NF-κB transcription factor. Importantly, knock down of TNFAIP2 led to reduced intracellular replication of L. pneumophila Corby in A549 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, genome-wide chromatin analysis of L. pneumophila-infected macrophages demonstrated induction of TNFAIP2, a NF-κB-dependent factor relevant for bacterial replication.","['Du Bois I', 'Marsico A', 'Bertrams W', 'Schweiger MR', 'Caffrey BE', 'Sittka-Stark A', 'Eberhardt M', 'Vera J', 'Vingron M', 'Schmeck BT']",2016,214,3,J Infect Dis,"Du Bois I, et al.

27114610,Genetic functions of the NAIP family of inflammasome receptors for bacterial ligands in mice.,"Biochemical studies suggest that the NAIP family of NLR proteins are cytosolic innate receptors that directly recognize bacterial ligands and trigger NLRC4 inflammasome activation. In this study, we generated Naip5(-/-), Naip1(-/-), and Naip2(-/-) mice and showed that bone marrow macrophages derived from these knockout mice are specifically deficient in detecting bacterial flagellin, the type III secretion system needle, and the rod protein, respectively. Naip1(-/-), Naip2(-/-), and Naip5(-/-) mice also resist lethal inflammasome activation by the corresponding ligand. Furthermore, infections performed in the Naip-deficient macrophages have helped to define the major signal in Legionella pneumophila, Salmonella Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri that is detected by the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome. Using an engineered S. Typhimurium infection model, we demonstrate the critical role of NAIPs in clearing bacterial infection and protecting mice from bacterial virulence-induced lethality. These results provide definitive genetic evidence for the important physiological function of NAIPs in antibacterial defense and inflammatory damage-induced lethality in mice.","['Zhao Y', 'Shi J', 'Shi X', 'Wang Y', 'Wang F', 'Shao F']",2016,213,5,J Exp Med,"Zhao Y, et al.

27113731,Optimized methods for Legionella pneumophila release from its Acanthamoeba hosts.,"BACKGROUND: Free-living amoebae (FLA) and particularly acanthamoebae serve as vehicles and hosts for Legionella pneumophila, among other pathogenic microorganisms. Within the amoebae, L. pneumophila activates a complex regulatory pathway that enables the bacteria to resist amoebal digestion and to replicate. Moreover, the amoebae provide the bacteria protection against harsh environmental conditions and disinfectants commonly used in engineered water systems. To study this ecological relationship, co-culture and infection models have been used. However, there is a lack of data regarding the effectiveness of the different methods used to release intracellular bacteria from their amoebal hosts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the methods used to release intracellular L. pneumophila cells on the culturability of the bacteria. Furthermore, the standard method ISO 11731:1998 for the recovery and enumeration of Legionella from water samples was evaluated for its suitability to quantify intracellular bacteria.
RESULTS: The effectiveness of the eight release treatments applied to L. pneumophila and Acanthamoeba strains in a free-living state varied between bacterial strains. Moreover, the current study provides numerical data on the state of co-culture suspensions at different time points. The release treatments enhanced survival of both microorganisms in co-cultures of L. pneumophila and Acanthamoeba. Passage through a needle (21G, 27G) and centrifugation at 10,000 × g showed the highest bacterial counts when releasing the bacteria from the intracellular state. Regarding the ISO 11731:1998 method, one of the tested strains showed no differences between the recovery rates of associated and free-living L. pneumophila. However, a reduced bacterial recovery rate was observed for the second L. pneumophila strain used, and this difference is likely linked to the survival of the amoebae.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical release treatments were the most effective methods for providing bacterial release without the use of chemicals that could compromise further study of the intracellular bacteria. The current results demonstrated that the recovery of L. pneumophila from water systems may be underestimated if protozoal membranes are not disrupted.","['Dietersdorfer E', 'Cervero-Aragó S', 'Sommer R', 'Kirschner AK', 'Walochnik J']",2016,16,,BMC Microbiol,"Dietersdorfer E, et al.

27108684,Travel-associated infections caused by unusual serogroups of Legionella pneumophila identified using Legionella BIOCHIP slides in Turkey and Iraq.,"BACKGROUND: Although Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is the common disease causing serogroup, rare serogroups can also may cause legionellosis. A 54-year-old male patient (index case) reported that he had been on a religious trip (for visiting, tomb of Ali, which is important for Shias) to Iraq with a large group (50 shia pilgrims from Kars city of Turkey) two weeks prior to admission. Due to civil war, the hotel where the patient stayed in Iraq lacked proper hygiene. A large number of people in the travel group were experiencing the same symptoms. Other five cases were 2 males (ages; 50, 45) and 3 females including the wife of the index case (ages; 50, 28, 27).
METHOD: The detection of L. pneumophila IgG and IgM was performed by anti-L. pneumophila Indirect Immunofluorescent IgM, IgG kit. Legionella 1 biochip/verification BIOCHIP slides were used for serogrouping in Euroimmun AG, Leubeck, Germany.
RESULTS: In index case, L. pneumophila IgM was positive with a titer of 1/32 titer. IgG was negative with a 1/100 titer. Another case (28 year old female), had clinical symptoms identical to the index case. L. pneumophila IgM and IgG were positive with titers of 1/64 and 1/100, respectively. These two cases were diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 12 (index case) and female (28-year-old) by serogroup 11. The other 4 cases were diagnosed with possible Pontiac fever caused by L. pneumophila serogroups 14 (wife of the index case), 4, and 6 whereas the serogroup of L. pneumophila detected in 27 years old female case could not be identified.
CONCLUSION: A major limitation of this work is the absence of genotyping and the serogroup difference between index case and his wife who shared the same hotel. We suggest that this serogroup difference may be caused by (for men and women) sitting separately in Islamic rules. On the other hand, the movement of people in the context of mutual visits between countries or neighboring countries for tourism-related (i.e., for religious events or visits to holy sites) or immigration-related reasons, may cause some epidemic diseases. This study reemphasized that not only L. pneumophila serogroup 1, but other rare serogroups might cause also legionellosis which may increase in frequency and cause regional epidemics. We propose that increased financial resources for improving the hygiene conditions and performing routine legionella surveillance studies in touristic hotels would be useful measures for legionellosis prevention and control.","['Kocazeybek BS', 'Yuksel P', 'Keskin D', 'Sheikh S', 'Habip Z', 'Yavuzer SS', 'Caliskan R', 'Altun YM', 'Kuskucu M', 'Cengiz M', 'Dinc HO', 'Karakullukcu A', 'Ergin S', 'Saribas S', 'Yilmaz N', 'Tokman HB']",2016,14,3,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Kocazeybek BS, et al.

27105352,Neutrophil and Alveolar Macrophage-Mediated Innate Immune Control of Legionella pneumophila Lung Infection via TNF and ROS.,"Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular bacterium that lives in aquatic environments where it parasitizes amoeba. However, upon inhalation of contaminated aerosols it can infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages, which can result in Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia. Upon experimental airway infection of mice, L. pneumophila is rapidly controlled by innate immune mechanisms. Here we identified, on a cell-type specific level, the key innate effector functions responsible for rapid control of infection. In addition to the well-characterized NLRC4-NAIP5 flagellin recognition pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also essential for effective innate immune control of L. pneumophila. While ROS are essential for the bactericidal activity of neutrophils, alveolar macrophages (AM) rely on neutrophil and monocyte-derived TNF signaling via TNFR1 to restrict bacterial replication. This TNF-mediated antibacterial mechanism depends on the acidification of lysosomes and their fusion with L. pneumophila containing vacuoles (LCVs), as well as caspases with a minor contribution from cysteine-type cathepsins or calpains, and is independent of NLRC4, caspase-1, caspase-11 and NOX2. This study highlights the differential utilization of innate effector pathways to curtail intracellular bacterial replication in specific host cells upon L. pneumophila airway infection.","['Ziltener P', 'Reinheckel T', 'Oxenius A']",2016,12,4,PLoS Pathog,"Ziltener P, et al.

Escherichia coli K12 bacteria were employed to provide a proof-of-concept of chemotaxis-enhanced bacterial immobilization, and then, these results were confirmed using Legionella pneumophila. The recognition layer was based on a self-assembled monolayer of thiol functionalized with specific antibodies directed toward E. coli or L. pneumophila, together with the enzyme beta-galactosidase (β-gal). The authors hypothesized that this enzyme together with its substrate lactose would produce a gradient of glucose which would attract bacteria toward the biochip surface. The chemotaxis effect was monitored by comparing the number of bacteria bound to the biochip surface with and without attractant. The authors have observed that β-gal plus lactose enhanced the immobilization of bacteria on our biochips with a higher effect at low bacterial concentrations. At 100 and 10 bacteria/ml, respectively, for E. coli and L. pneumophila, the authors observed up to 11 and 8 times more bacteria bound to biochip surfaces assisted with the chemotaxis effect in comparison to biochips without chemotaxis.

27096482,"[Prevention of Legionella pneumonia in the Netherlands: results from the Legionella Source Identification Unit, 2002-2012].","OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of a Legionella pneumonia (LP) prevention programme.
DESIGN: Observational study.
METHOD: We evaluated the effectiveness of the current LP prevention programme using two outcome measures, genotype match and cluster, for the period 2002-2012. If patients were associated with a source of infection via a matching or as part of a cluster it could be assumed that prevention of LP was achieved by implementing control measures for this source. By comparing genotypes we were given an indirect impression of the validity of the sampling process.
RESULTS: Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was detected in 97 (7%) of the 1484 sampled sources. A likely source of infection was identified for 41 (2%) of the 1991 LP patients, and confirmed by matching. In more than half of these patients, the source was either a residential house or a hospital. Of the 1991 LP patients, 266 (13%) were part of a cluster. Two L. pneumophila serogroup 1 genotypes, ST47 and ST62, were present in 48% of the LP patients, but these genotypes were seldom detected in source sampling (0.9%).
CONCLUSION: The current method of source detection does not adequately contribute to the prevention of LP, because the presence of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 is not often detected in the source. Other sources than those currently known are probably involved in the transmission of these bacteria. Serial infection via a common source is a substantial cause of LP, which emphasises the importance of cluster registration.

A significant reduction of L. pneumophila counts was observed by culture after heat shock disinfection. The following corrective measures were implemented to control L. pneumophila: increasing the hot water temperature (55 to 60 °C), flushing taps weekly with hot water, removing excess lengths of piping and maintaining a water temperature of 55 °C throughout the system. A gradual reduction in L. pneumophila counts was observed using the culture method and qPCR in the 18 months after implementation of the corrective measures. However, low level contamination was retained in areas with hydraulic deficiencies, highlighting the importance of maintaining a good thermal regime at all points within the system to control the population of L. pneumophila.","['Bédard E', 'Boppe I', 'Kouamé S', 'Martin P', 'Pinsonneault L', 'Valiquette L', 'Racine J', 'Prévost M']",2016,5,2,Pathogens,"Bédard E, et al.

27091026,Coxiella burnetii dormancy in a fatal ten-year multisystem dysfunctional illness: case report.,"BACKGROUND: In a previous study of a Q fever outbreak in Birmingham, our group identified a non-infective complex of Coxiella burnetii (C.b.) antigens able to survive in the host and provoked aberrant humoral and cell-mediated immunity responses. The study led to recognition of a possible pathogenic link between C.b. infection and subsequent long-term post Q fever fatigue syndrome (QFS). This report presents an unusually severe case of C.b. antigen and DNA detection in post-mortem specimens from a patient with QFS.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 19-year old female patient who became ill with an acute unexplained febrile encephalitis-like illness, followed by increasingly severe multisystem dysfunction and death 10 years later. During life, extensive clinical and laboratory investigations from different disciplinary stand points failed to deliver a definitive identification of a cause. Given the history of susceptibility to infection from birth, acute fever and the diagnosis of ""post viral syndrome"", tests for infective agents were done starting with C.b. and Legionella pneumophila. The patient had previously visited farms a number of times. Comprehensive neuropathological assessment at the time of autopsy had not revealed gross or microscopic abnormalities. The aim was to extend detailed studies with the post-mortem samples and identify possible factors driving severe disturbance of homeostasis and organ dysfunction exhibited by the course of the patient's ten-year illness. Immunohistochemistry for C.b. antigen and PCR for DNA were tested on paraffin embedded blocks of autopsy tissues from brain, spleen, liver, lymph nodes (LN), bone marrow (BM), heart and lung. Standard H&E staining of brain sections was unrevealing. Immuno-staining analysis for astrocyte cytoskeleton proteins using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies showed a reactive morphology. Coxiella antigens were demonstrated in GFAP immuno-positive grey and white matter astrocytes, spleen, liver, heart, BM and LN. PCR analysis (COM1/IS1111 genes) confirmed the presence of C.b. DNA in heart, lung, spleen, liver & LN, but not in brain or BM.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed the persistence of C. b. cell components in various organs, including astrocytes of the brain, in a post-infection QFS. The possible mechanisms and molecular adaptations for this alternative C.b. life style are discussed.","['Sukocheva OA', 'Manavis J', 'Kok TW', 'Turra M', 'Izzo A', 'Blumbergs P', 'Marmion BP']",2016,16,,BMC Infect Dis,"Sukocheva OA, et al.

Eighty six respiratory tract samples and urine were collected from clinically diagnosed pneumonia patients and 12 water samples were collected from different environment. Identification of Legionella was done by culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of respiratory tract samples and environmental samples and Legionella Antigen (Ag) in urine was detected by Immunochromatographic test (ICT). Legionella was identified from 4 (4.65%) clinically diagnosed pneumonia patients of which 1(1.16%) case was culture positive, 1(1.16%) case was urine ICT positive and PCR was positive in all four cases. Of the 12 water samples tested, 4 (33.33%) samples were Legionella positive by PCR but culture results of these samples were negative. Identification of Legionella should be done by PCR in parallel with culture and urine ICT. Detection of Legionella in environmental samples is also needed to explore possible links between the water sources and disease transmission in population.","['Jahan R', 'Tarafder S', 'Saleh AA', 'Miah MR']",2015,41,1,Bangladesh Med Res Counc Bull,"Jahan R, et al.

However, a weak relation between fecal E. coli and water viruses or bacterial pathogens has been demonstrated by previous studies. Therefore, for water pathogen study, it is essential to select and quantify typical pathogens. In this study, a combination of quantitative PCR ( qPCR) with flow cytometry (FCM) was established to detect the concentrations of viruses, bacteria and several typical pathogens (e.g., E. coli, Legionnella, HAdV, Giardia, Cryptosporidium) in water. The method was applied to measure the pathogen concentrations in the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), as well as its receiving river. The results revealed that the WWTP treated the pathogens with high removal efficiency ( > 93%); the effluent of WWTP did not show a negative effect on pathogen concentration of the receiving river. The study provides a technical support for the evaluation of WWTP treatment effect and the ecological impact of WWTP effluent on receiving river.","['Wang MX', 'Bai YH', 'Liang JS', 'Huo Y', 'Yang TT', 'Yuan LJ']",2016,37,1,Huan Jing Ke Xue,"Wang MX, et al.

It is therefore mandatory to organize plans of surveillance, prevention and control in order to avoid disease appearance in immunosuppressed patients, with higher risk of death. Guidelines for the prevention of Legionnaires' disease have been published, benefiting those who face this problem, but definitive standardized solutions do not exist yet. Here we describe fifteen years of activity, during which our study group gathered interesting data on the control of Legionella contamination. Water disinfection is not generally sufficient to control the risk of infection, but a complex water safety plan should be developed, including system maintenance, training of staff and implementation of a clinical surveillance system aimed at early detection of cases. Concerning the control measures, we evaluated the effectiveness of different treatments suggested to reduce Legionella spp contamination, comparing our results with the current literature data. The performance ranking was highest for the filter, followed by boilers at high temperature, monochloramine and, at a lower level, chlorine dioxide; the effectiveness of hyperchlorination was limited, and thermal shock was even more ineffective.","['Borella P', 'Bargellini A', 'Marchegiano P', 'Vecchi E', 'Marchesi I']",2016,28,2,Ann Ig,"Borella P, et al.

27068091,Type I Interferon Counters or Promotes Coxiella burnetii Replication Dependent on Tissue.,"Coxiella burnetii is an intracellular pathogen and the cause of Q fever. Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) is critical for host protection from infection, but a role for type I IFN in C. burnetii infection has not been determined. Type I IFN supports host protection from a related pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, and we hypothesized that it would be similarly protective in C. burnetii infection. In contrast to our prediction, IFN-α receptor-deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice were protected from C. burnetii-induced infection. Therefore, the role of type I IFN in C. burnetii infection was distinct from that in L. pneumophila Mice treated with a double-stranded-RNA mimetic were protected from C. burnetii-induced weight loss through an IFNAR-independent pathway. We next treated mice with recombinant IFN-α (rIFN-α). When rIFN-α was injected by the intraperitoneal route during infection, disease-induced weight loss was exacerbated. Mice that received rIFN-α by this route had dampened interleukin 1β (IL-1β) expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. However, when rIFN-α was delivered to the lung, bacterial replication was decreased in all tissues. Thus, the presence of type I IFN in the lung protected from infection, but when delivered to the periphery, type I IFN enhanced disease, potentially by dampening inflammatory cytokines. To better characterize the capacity for type I IFN induction by C. burnetii, we assessed expression of IFN-β transcripts by human macrophages following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from C. burnetii Understanding innate responses in C. burnetii infection will support the discovery of novel therapies that may be alternative or complementary to the current antibiotic treatment.","['Hedges JF', 'Robison A', 'Kimmel E', 'Christensen K', 'Lucas E', 'Ramstead A', 'Jutila MA']",2016,84,6,Infect Immun,"Hedges JF, et al.

27060122,Genomic Resolution of Outbreak-Associated Legionella pneumophila Serogroup 1 Isolates from New York State.,"UNLABELLED: A total of 30 Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates representing 10 separate legionellosis laboratory investigations (""outbreaks"") that occurred in New York State between 2004 and 2012 were selected for evaluation of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approaches for molecular subtyping of this organism. Clinical and environmental isolates were available for each outbreak and were initially examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Sequence-based typing alleles were extracted from WGS data yielding complete sequence types (ST) for isolates representing 8 out of the 10 outbreaks evaluated in this study. Isolates from separate outbreaks sharing the same ST also contained the fewest differences in core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the greatest proportion of identical allele sequences in a whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) scheme. Both core SNP and wgMLST analyses distinguished isolates from separate outbreaks, including those from two outbreaks sharing indistinguishable PFGE profiles. Isolates from a hospital-associated outbreak spanning multiple years shared indistinguishable PFGE profiles but displayed differences in their genome sequences, suggesting the presence of multiple environmental sources. Finally, the rtx gene demonstrated differences in the repeat region sequence among ST1 isolates from different outbreaks, suggesting that variation in this gene may be useful for targeted molecular subtyping approaches for L. pneumophila This study demonstrates the utility of various genome sequence analysis approaches for L. pneumophila for environmental source attribution studies while furthering the understanding of Legionella ecology.
IMPORTANCE: We demonstrate that whole-genome sequencing helps to improve resolution of Legionella pneumophila isolated during laboratory investigations of legionellosis compared to traditional subtyping methods. These data can be important in confirming the environmental sources of legionellosis outbreaks. Moreover, we evaluated various methods to analyze genome sequence data to help resolve outbreak-related isolates.","['Raphael BH', 'Baker DJ', 'Nazarian E', 'Lapierre P', 'Bopp D', 'Kozak-Muiznieks NA', 'Morrison SS', 'Lucas CE', 'Mercante JW', 'Musser KA', 'Winchell JM']",2016,82,12,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Raphael BH, et al.

27050889,Clinical Characteristics of Legionella Pneumonia Diagnosed with Legionella Urinary Antigen Test.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics of Legionella pneumonia diagnosed with a positive urinary antigen test, and factors associated with severe Legionella pneumonia were investigated.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with Legionella pneumonia diagnosed at Tokai University Hospital between February 2006 and June 2012. The clinical characteristics of ICU cases and non-ICU cases were compared.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with Legionella pneumonia were identified (mean age 66.7 ± 19.3). Twenty patients were men (76.9 %). Impaired consciousness was observed in 12 patients (46.2 %), followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (38.5 %). Ten patients had severe pneumonia which required ICU admission. A case-controlled study comparing non-ICU cases and ICU cases demonstrated that cases with diabetes (OR 10.1, 95 % CI 1.1-90.5) and tachycardia (OR 10.1, 95 % CI 1.1-90.5) were significantly associated with ICU admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Legionella pneumonia did not always present as severe pneumonia. Extrapulmonary manifestations may be useful clues for diagnosis. Diabetic patients have not only a risk of contracting Legionella pneumonia, but also a risk of progression. Legionella pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis even in cases of mild to moderate pneumonia when presenting with extrapulmonary symptoms, especially in diabetic patients.","['Ueda A', 'Oki M', 'Yanagi H', 'Ozawa H', 'Takagi A']",2016,41,1,Tokai J Exp Clin Med,"Ueda A, et al.

27049943,Ubiquitination independent of E1 and E2 enzymes by bacterial effectors.,"Signalling by ubiquitination regulates virtually every cellular process in eukaryotes. Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate is catalysed by the E1, E2 and E3 three-enzyme cascade, which links the carboxy terminus of ubiquitin to the ε-amino group of, in most cases, a lysine of the substrate via an isopeptide bond. Given the essential roles of ubiquitination in the regulation of the immune system, it is not surprising that the ubiquitination network is a common target for diverse infectious agents. For example, many bacterial pathogens exploit ubiquitin signalling using virulence factors that function as E3 ligases, deubiquitinases or as enzymes that directly attack ubiquitin. The bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila utilizes approximately 300 effectors that modulate diverse host processes to create a permissive niche for its replication in phagocytes. Here we demonstrate that members of the SidE effector family of L. pneumophila ubiquitinate multiple Rab small GTPases associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, we show that these proteins are capable of catalysing ubiquitination without the need for the E1 and E2 enzymes. A putative mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase motif critical for the ubiquitination activity is also essential for the role of the SidE family in intracellular bacterial replication in a protozoan host. The E1/E2-independent ubiquitination catalysed by these enzymes is energized by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which activates ubiquitin by the formation of ADP-ribosylated ubiquitin. These results establish that ubiquitination can be catalysed by a single enzyme, the activity of which does not require ATP.","['Qiu J', 'Sheedlo MJ', 'Yu K', 'Tan Y', 'Nakayasu ES', 'Das C', 'Liu X', 'Luo ZQ']",2016,533,7601,Nature,"Qiu J, et al.

27046155,Rapid investigation of cases and clusters of Legionnaires' disease in England and Wales using direct molecular typing.,"Legionella pneumophila is the leading cause of Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia that can occur as sporadic cases or point-source outbreaks affecting multiple patients. The infection is acquired by inhalation of aerosols from contaminated water systems. In order to identify the probable source and prevent further cases, clinical and environmental isolates are compared using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Typically up to 10 days are required to isolate L. pneumophila prior to the application of standard typing protocols. A rapid protocol using a real-time PCR specific for L. pneumophila and serogroup 1, combined with nested direct molecular typing, was adopted by Public Health England in 2012 to reduce reporting time for preliminary typing results. This rapid protocol was first used to investigate an outbreak that occurred in July/August 2012 and due to the positive feedback from that investigation, it was subsequently applied to other incidents in England and Wales where faster typing results would have aided incident investigation. We present here results from seven incidents that occurred between July 2012 and June 2015 where the use of this rapid approach provided preliminary characterization of the infecting strain in an average 1.58 days (SD 1.01) after sample receipt in contrast to 9.53 days (SD 3.73) when standard protocols were applied.","['Mentasti M', 'Afshar B', 'Collins S', 'Walker J', 'Harrison TG', 'Chalker V']",2016,65,6,J Med Microbiol,"Mentasti M, et al.

However, current Legionella risk assessments may be compromised by uncertainties in Legionella detection methods. Here, we investigated the presence of L. pneumophila mip gene in water samples collected from different hospitals cooling towers, nursing homes and building/hotels water coolants from two geographical locations of Iran (Kerman and Bam cities) during summer season of 2015 by both nested and real-time PCR methods. Analysis of the 128 water samples for presence of the mip gene by nested-PCR revealed, 18 (23%) positive cases in Kerman and 7(14%) in Bam.

27014213,Dendrimers and Polyamino-Phenolic Ligands: Activity of New Molecules Against Legionella pneumophila Biofilms.,"Legionnaires' disease is a potentially fatal pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila, an aquatic bacterium often found within the biofilm niche. In man-made water systems microbial biofilms increase the resistance of legionella to disinfection, posing a significant threat to public health. Disinfection methods currently used in water systems have been shown to be ineffective against legionella over the long-term, allowing recolonization by the biofilm-protected microorganisms. In this study, the anti-biofilm activity of previously fabricated polyamino-phenolic ligands and polyamidoamine dendrimers was investigated against legionella mono-species and multi-species biofilms formed by L. pneumophila in association with other bacteria that can be found in tap water (Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae). Bacterial ability to form biofilms was verified using a crystal violet colorimetric assay and testing cell viability by real-time quantitative PCR and Plate Count assay. The concentration of the chemicals tested as anti-biofilm agents was chosen based on cytotoxicity assays: the highest non-cytotoxic chemical concentration was used for biofilm inhibition assays, with dendrimer concentration 10-fold higher than polyamino-phenolic ligands. While Macrophen and Double Macrophen were the most active substances among polyamino-phenolic ligands, dendrimers were overall twofold more effective than all other compounds with a reduction up to 85 and 73% of legionella and multi-species biofilms, respectively. Chemical interaction with matrix molecules is hypothesized, based on SEM images and considering the low or absent anti-microbial activity on planktonic bacteria showed by flow cytometry. These data suggest that the studied compounds, especially dendrimers, could be considered as novel molecules in the design of research projects aimed at the development of efficacious anti-biofilm disinfection treatments of water systems in order to minimize legionellosis outbreaks.","['Andreozzi E', 'Barbieri F', 'Ottaviani MF', 'Giorgi L', 'Bruscolini F', 'Manti A', 'Battistelli M', 'Sabatini L', 'Pianetti A']",2016,7,,Front Microbiol,"Andreozzi E, et al.

27005665,Rab GTPases and the Autophagy Pathway: Bacterial Targets for a Suitable Biogenesis and Trafficking of Their Own Vacuoles.,"Autophagy is an intracellular process that comprises degradation of damaged organelles, protein aggregates and intracellular pathogens, having an important role in controlling the fate of invading microorganisms. Intracellular pathogens are internalized by professional and non-professional phagocytes, localizing in compartments called phagosomes. To degrade the internalized microorganism, the microbial phagosome matures by fusion events with early and late endosomal compartments and lysosomes, a process that is regulated by Rab GTPases. Interestingly, in order to survive and replicate in the phagosome, some pathogens employ different strategies to manipulate vesicular traffic, inhibiting phagolysosomal biogenesis (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or surviving in acidic compartments and forming replicative vacuoles (e.g., Coxiella burnetti and Legionella pneumophila). The bacteria described in this review often use secretion systems to control the host's response and thus disseminate. To date, eight types of secretion systems (Type I to Type VIII) are known. Some of these systems are used by bacteria to translocate pathogenic proteins into the host cell and regulate replicative vacuole formation, apoptosis, cytokine responses, and autophagy. Herein, we have focused on how bacteria manipulate small Rab GTPases to control many of these processes. The growing knowledge in this field may facilitate the development of new treatments or contribute to the prevention of these types of bacterial infections.","['López de Armentia MM', 'Amaya C', 'Colombo MI']",2016,5,1,Cells,"López de Armentia MM, et al.

26998861,Legionella: virulence factors and host response.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular pathogen and an important cause of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. This review focuses on the latest literature examining Legionella's virulence strategies and the mammalian host response.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies identify novel virulence strategies used by L. pneumophila and new aspects of the host immune response to this pathogen. Legionella prevents acidification of the phagosome by recruiting Rab1, a host protein. Legionella also blocks a conserved endoplasmic reticulum stress response. To access iron from host stores, L. pneumophila upregulates more regions allowing vacuolar colocalization N. In response to Legionella, the host cell may activate caspase-1, caspase-11 (mice) or caspase-4 (humans). Caspase-3 and apoptosis are activated by a secreted, bacterial effector. Infected cells send signals to their uninfected neighbors, allowing the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines in trans. Antibody subclasses provide robust protection against Legionella.
SUMMARY: L. pneumophila is a significant human pathogen that lives in amoebae in the environment but may opportunistically infect the alveolar macrophage. To maintain its intracellular lifestyle, Legionella extracts essential iron from the cell, blocks inflammatory responses and manipulates trafficking to avoid fusion with the lysosome. The mammalian host has counter strategies, which include the release of proinflammatory cytokines, the activation of caspases and antibody-mediated immunity.",['Misch EA'],2016,29,3,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Misch EA.

26993637,Under the Weather: Legionellosis and Meteorological Factors.,"The incidence of legionellosis, caused by the bacteria Legionella which are commonly found in the environment, has been increasing in New Jersey (NJ) over the last decade. The majority of cases are sporadic with no known source of exposure. Meteorological factors may be associated with increases in legionellosis. Time series and case-crossover study designs were used to evaluate associations of legionellosis and meteorological factors (temperature (daily minimum, maximum, and mean), precipitation, dew point, relative humidity, sea level pressure, wind speed (daily maximum and mean), gust, and visibility). Time series analyses of multi-factor models indicated increases in monthly relative humidity and precipitation were positively associated with monthly legionellosis rate, while maximum temperature and visibility were inversely associated. Case-crossover analyses of multi-factor models indicated increases in relative humidity occurring likely before incubation period was positively associated, while sea level pressure and visibility, also likely preceding incubation period, were inversely associated. It is possible that meteorological factors, such as wet, humid weather with low barometric pressure, allow proliferation of Legionella in natural environments, increasing the rate of legionellosis.","['Gleason JA', 'Kratz NR', 'Greeley RD', 'Fagliano JA']",2016,13,2,Ecohealth,"Gleason JA, et al.

However, Legionella spp. were detected at temperatures exceeding the recommended pasteurization temperatures using polymerase chain reaction assays. The aim of the current study was thus to apply EMA quantitative polymerase chain reaction (EMA-qPCR) to determine whether the Legionella spp. detected were intact cells and therefore possibly viable at pasteurization temperatures >70°C. The BacTiter-Glo™ Microbial Cell Viability Assay was also used to detect the presence of ATP in the tested samples, as ATP indicates the presence of metabolically active cells. Chemical analysis also indicated that all anions and cations were within the respective drinking water guidelines, with the exception of iron (mean: 186.76 μg/L) and aluminium (mean: 188.13 μg/L), which were detected in the pasteurized tank water samples at levels exceeding recommended guidelines. The BacTiter-Glo™ Microbial Cell Viability Assay indicated the presence of viable cells for all pasteurized temperatures tested, with the percentage of ATP (in the form of relative light units) decreasing with increasing temperature [70-79°C (96.7%); 80- 89°C (99.2%); 90-95°C (99.7%)]. EMA-qPCR then indicated that while solar pasteurization significantly reduced (p<0.05) the genomic copy numbers of intact Legionella cells in the pasteurized tank water (~99%), no significant difference (p>0.05) in the mean copy numbers was detected with an increase in the pasteurization temperature, with 6 × 10(3) genomic copies/mL DNA sample obtained at 95°C. As intact Legionella cells were detected in the pasteurized tank water samples, quantitative microbial risk assessment studies need to be conducted to determine the potential health risk associated with using the water for domestic purposes.","['Reyneke B', 'Dobrowsky PH', 'Ndlovu T', 'Khan S', 'Khan W']",2016,553,,Sci Total Environ,"Reyneke B, et al.

26971469,Mutagenic and chemical analyses provide new insight into enzyme activation and mechanism of the type 2 iron-sulfur l-serine dehydratase from Legionella pneumophila.,"The crystal structure of the Type 2 l-serine dehydratase from Legionella pneumophila (lpLSD), revealed a ""tail-in-mouth"" configuration where the C-terminal residue acts as an intrinsic competitive inhibitor. This pre-catalytic structure undergoes an activation step prior to catalytic turnover. Mutagenic analysis of residues at or near the active site cleft is consistent with stabilization of substrate binding by many of the same residues that interact with the C-terminal cysteine and highlight the critical role of certain tail residues in activity. pH-rate profiles show that a residue with pK of 5.9 must be deprotonated and a residue with a pK of 8.5 must be protonated for activity. This supports an earlier suggestion that His 61 is the likely catalytic base. An additional residue with a pK of 8.5-9 increases cooperativity when it is deprotonated. This investigation also demonstrates that the Fe-S dehydratases convert the enamine/imine intermediates of the catalytic reaction to products on the enzyme prior to release. This is in contrast to pyridoxyl 5' phosphate based dehydratases that release an enamine/imine intermediate into solution, which then hydrolyzes to produce the ketoamine product.","['Xu XL', 'Grant GA']",2016,596,,Arch Biochem Biophys,Xu XL and Grant GA.

26969696,Control of Legionella Contamination and Risk of Corrosion in Hospital Water Networks following Various Disinfection Procedures.,"Physical and chemical disinfection methods have been proposed with the aim of controlling Legionella water contamination. To date, the most effective procedures for reducing bacterial contamination have not yet been defined. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of various disinfection procedures in order to reduce both culturable and nonculturable (NC) legionellae in different hospital water networks treated with heat, chlorine dioxide, monochloramine, and hydrogen peroxide. The temperature levels and biocide concentrations that proved to give reliable results were analyzed. In order to study the possible effects on the water pipes, we verified the extent of corrosion on experimental coupons after applying each method for 6 months. The percentage of positive points was at its lowest after treatment with monochloramine, followed by chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hyperthermia. Different selections of Legionella spp. were observed, as networks treated with chlorine-based disinfectants were contaminated mainly by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, hyperthermia was associated with serogroups 2 to 14, and hydrogen peroxide treatment was associated mainly with non-pneumophila species. NC cells were detected only in heat-treated waters, and also when the temperature was approximately 60°C. The corrosion rates of the coupons were within a satisfactory limit for water networks, but the morphologies differed. We confirm here that chemical disinfection controls Legionella colonization more effectively than hyperthermia does. Monochloramine was the most effective treatment, while hydrogen peroxide may be a promising alternative to chlorine-based disinfectants due to its ability to select for other, less virulent or nonpathogenic species.","['Marchesi I', 'Ferranti G', 'Mansi A', 'Marcelloni AM', 'Proietto AR', 'Saini N', 'Borella P', 'Bargellini A']",2016,82,10,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Marchesi I, et al.

26969695,Complementation of Arginine Auxotrophy for Genetic Transformation of Coxiella burnetii by Use of a Defined Axenic Medium.,"UNLABELLED: Host cell-free (axenic) culture of Coxiella burnetii in acidified citrate cysteine medium-2 (ACCM-2) has provided important opportunities for investigating the biology of this naturally obligate intracellular pathogen and enabled the development of tools for genetic manipulation. However, ACCM-2 has complex nutrient sources that preclude a detailed study of nutritional factors required for C. burnetii growth. Metabolic reconstruction of C. burnetii predicts that the bacterium cannot synthesize all amino acids and therefore must sequester some from the host. To examine C. burnetii amino acid auxotrophies, we developed a nutritionally defined medium with known amino acid concentrations, termed ACCM-D. Compared to ACCM-2, ACCM-D supported longer logarithmic growth, a more gradual transition to stationary phase, and approximately 5- to 10-fold greater overall replication. Small-cell-variant morphological forms generated in ACCM-D also showed increased viability relative to that generated in ACCM-2. Lack of growth in amino acid-deficient formulations of ACCM-D revealed C. burnetii auxotrophy for 11 amino acids, including arginine. Heterologous expression of Legionella pneumophila argGH in C. burnetii permitted growth in ACCM-D missing arginine and supplemented with citrulline, thereby providing a nonantibiotic means of selection of C. burnetii genetic transformants. Consistent with bioinformatic predictions, the elimination of glucose did not impair C. burnetii replication. Together, these results highlight the advantages of a nutritionally defined medium in investigations of C. burnetii metabolism and the development of genetic tools.
IMPORTANCE: Host cell-free growth and genetic manipulation of Coxiella burnetii have revolutionized research of this intracellular bacterial pathogen. Nonetheless, undefined components of growth medium have made studies of C. burnetii physiology difficult and have precluded the development of selectable markers for genetic transformation based on nutritional deficiencies. Here, we describe a medium, containing only amino acids as the sole source of carbon and energy, which supports robust growth and improved viability of C. burnetii Growth studies confirmed that C. burnetii cannot replicate in medium lacking arginine. However, genetic transformation of the bacterium with constructs containing the last two genes in the L. pneumophila arginine biosynthesis pathway (argGH) allowed growth on defined medium missing arginine but supplemented with the arginine precursor citrulline. Our results advance the field by facilitating studies of C. burnetii metabolism and allowing non-antibiotic-based selection of C. burnetii genetic transformants, an important achievement considering that selectable makers based on antibiotic resistance are limited.","['Sandoz KM', 'Beare PA', 'Cockrell DC', 'Heinzen RA']",2016,82,10,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Sandoz KM, et al.

To investigate the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme in the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila, we determined the crystal structures of the L. pneumophila HGPRT (LpHGPRT) both in its apo-form and in complex with GMP. The structures reveal that LpHGPRT comprises a core domain and a hood domain which are packed together to create a cavity for GMP-binding and the enzymatic catalysis. The binding of GMP induces conformational changes of the stable loop II. This new binding site is closely related to the Gout arthritis-linked human HGPRT mutation site (Ser103Arg). Finally, these structures of LpHGPRT provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of HGPRT.","['Zhang N', 'Gong X', 'Lu M', 'Chen X', 'Qin X', 'Ge H']",2016,194,3,J Struct Biol,"Zhang N, et al.

26960131,Initiating heavy-atom-based phasing by multi-dimensional molecular replacement.,"To obtain an electron-density map from a macromolecular crystal the phase problem needs to be solved, which often involves the use of heavy-atom derivative crystals and concomitant heavy-atom substructure determination. This is typically performed by dual-space methods, direct methods or Patterson-based approaches, which however may fail when only poorly diffracting derivative crystals are available. This is often the case for, for example, membrane proteins. Here, an approach for heavy-atom site identification based on a molecular-replacement parameter matrix (MRPM) is presented. It involves an n-dimensional search to test a wide spectrum of molecular-replacement parameters, such as different data sets and search models with different conformations. Results are scored by the ability to identify heavy-atom positions from anomalous difference Fourier maps. The strategy was successfully applied in the determination of a membrane-protein structure, the copper-transporting P-type ATPase CopA, when other methods had failed to determine the heavy-atom substructure. MRPM is well suited to proteins undergoing large conformational changes where multiple search models should be considered, and it enables the identification of weak but correct molecular-replacement solutions with maximum contrast to prime experimental phasing efforts.","['Pedersen BP', 'Gourdon P', 'Liu X', 'Karlsen JL', 'Nissen P']",2016,72,Pt 3,Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,"Pedersen BP, et al.

26951763,Feature selection and validated predictive performance in the domain of Legionella pneumophila: a comparative study.,"BACKGROUND: Genetic comparisons of clinical and environmental Legionella strains form an essential part of outbreak investigations. DNA microarrays often comprise many DNA markers (features). Feature selection and the development of prediction models are particularly challenging in this domain with many variables and comparatively few subjects or data points. We aimed to compare modeling strategies to develop prediction models for classifying infections as clinical or environmental.
METHODS: We applied a bootstrap strategy for preselecting important features to a database containing 222 Legionella pneumophila strains with 448 continuous markers and a dichotomous outcome (clinical or environmental). Feature selection was done with 50 bootstrap samples resulting in a top 10 of most important features for each of four modeling techniques: classification and regression trees (CART), random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Validation was done in a second bootstrap re-sampling loop (200×) for evaluation of discriminatory model performance according to the AUC.
RESULTS: The top 5 of selected features differed considerably between the various modeling techniques, with only one common feature (""LePn.007B8""). The mean validated AUC-values of the SVM model and the CART model were 0.859 and 0.873 respectively. The LASSO and the RF model showed higher validated AUC-values (0.925 and 0.975 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In the domain of Legionella pneumophila, which comprises many potential features for classifying of infections as clinical or environmental, the RF and LASSO techniques provide good prediction models. The identification of potentially biologically relevant features is highly dependent on the technique used, and should hence be interpreted with caution.","['van der Ploeg T', 'Steyerberg EW']",2016,9,,BMC Res Notes,van der Ploeg T and Steyerberg EW.

The common waterborne pathogens were bacteria, including Legionella and other gram-negative bacteria, and nontuberculous mycobacteria, although fungi and viruses were occasionally described. These pathogens caused a variety of infections, including bacteremia and invasive and disseminated diseases, particularly among immunocompromised hosts and critically ill adults as well as neonates. Waterborne outbreaks occurred in healthcare settings with emergence of new reported reservoirs, including electronic faucets (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella), decorative water wall fountains (Legionella), and heater-cooler devices used in cardiac surgery (Mycobacterium chimaera).

26936325,Active and adaptive Legionella CRISPR-Cas reveals a recurrent challenge to the pathogen.,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with CRISPR-associated gene (CRISPR-Cas) systems are widely recognized as critical genome defense systems that protect microbes from external threats such as bacteriophage infection. Several isolates of the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila possess multiple CRISPR-Cas systems (type I-C, type I-F and type II-B), yet the targets of these systems remain unknown. With the recent observation that at least one of these systems (II-B) plays a non-canonical role in supporting intracellular replication, the possibility remained that these systems are vestigial genome defense systems co-opted for other purposes. Our data indicate that this is not the case. Using an established plasmid transformation assay, we demonstrate that type I-C, I-F and II-B CRISPR-Cas provide protection against spacer targets. We observe efficient laboratory acquisition of new spacers under 'priming' conditions, in which initially incomplete target elimination leads to the generation of new spacers and ultimate loss of the invasive DNA. Critically, we identify the first known target of L. pneumophila CRISPR-Cas: a 30 kb episome of unknown function whose interbacterial transfer is guarded against by CRISPR-Cas. We provide evidence that the element can subvert CRISPR-Cas by mutating its targeted sequences - but that primed spacer acquisition may limit this mechanism of escape. Rather than generally impinging on bacterial fitness, this element drives a host specialization event - with improved fitness in Acanthamoeba but a reduced ability to replicate in other hosts and conditions. These observations add to a growing body of evidence that host range restriction can serve as an existential threat to L. pneumophila in the wild.","['Rao C', 'Guyard C', 'Pelaz C', 'Wasserscheid J', 'Bondy-Denomy J', 'Dewar K', 'Ensminger AW']",2016,18,10,Cell Microbiol,"Rao C, et al.

26934669,The CpxRA two-component system contributes to Legionella pneumophila virulence.,"The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is capable of intracellular replication within freshwater protozoa as well as human macrophages, the latter of which results in the serious pneumonia Legionnaires' disease. A primary factor involved in these host cell interactions is the Dot/Icm Type IV secretion system responsible for translocating effector proteins needed to establish and maintain the bacterial replicative niche. Several regulatory factors have been identified to control the expression of the Dot/Icm system and effectors, one of which is the CpxRA two-component system, suggesting essentiality for virulence. In this study, we generated cpxR, cpxA and cpxRA in-frame null mutant strains to further delineate the role of the CpxRA system in bacterial survival and virulence. We found that cpxR is essential for intracellular replication within Acanthamoeba castellanii, but not in U937-derived macrophages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that CpxRA regulates a large number of virulence-associated proteins including Dot/Icm effectors as well as Type II secreted substrates. Furthermore, the cpxR and cpxRA mutant strains were more sodium resistant than the parental strain Lp02, and cpxRA expression reaches maximal levels during postexponential phase. Taken together, our findings suggest the CpxRA system is a key contributor to L. pneumophila virulence in protozoa via virulence factor regulation.","['Tanner JR', 'Li L', 'Faucher SP', 'Brassinga AK']",2016,100,6,Mol Microbiol,"Tanner JR, et al.

26928563,Determination of viable legionellae in engineered water systems: Do we find what we are looking for?,"In developed countries, legionellae are one of the most important water-based bacterial pathogens caused by management failure of engineered water systems. For routine surveillance of legionellae in engineered water systems and outbreak investigations, cultivation-based standard techniques are currently applied. However, in many cases culture-negative results are obtained despite the presence of viable legionellae, and clinical cases of legionellosis cannot be traced back to their respective contaminated water source. Among the various explanations for these discrepancies, the presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) Legionella cells has received increased attention in recent discussions and scientific literature. Alternative culture-independent methods to detect and quantify legionellae have been proposed in order to complement or even substitute the culture method in the future. Such methods should detect VBNC Legionella cells and provide a more comprehensive picture of the presence of legionellae in engineered water systems. However, it is still unclear whether and to what extent these VBNC legionellae are hazardous to human health. Current risk assessment models to predict the risk of legionellosis from Legionella concentrations in the investigated water systems contain many uncertainties and are mainly based on culture-based enumeration. If VBNC legionellae should be considered in future standard analysis, quantitative risk assessment models including VBNC legionellae must be proven to result in better estimates of human health risk than models based on cultivation alone. This review critically evaluates current methods to determine legionellae in the VBNC state, their potential to complement the standard culture-based method in the near future, and summarizes current knowledge on the threat that VBNC legionellae may pose to human health.",['Kirschner AKT'],2016,93,,Water Res,Kirschner AKT.

26924068,Subversion of Retrograde Trafficking by Translocated Pathogen Effectors.,"Intracellular bacterial pathogens subvert the endocytic bactericidal pathway to form specific replication-permissive compartments termed pathogen vacuoles or inclusions. To this end, the pathogens employ type III or type IV secretion systems, which translocate dozens, if not hundreds, of different effector proteins into their host cells, where they manipulate vesicle trafficking and signaling pathways in favor of the intruders. While the distinct cocktail of effectors defines the specific processes by which a pathogen vacuole is formed, the different pathogens commonly target certain vesicle trafficking routes, including the endocytic or secretory pathway. Recently, the retrograde transport pathway from endosomal compartments to the trans-Golgi network emerged as an important route affecting pathogen vacuole formation. Here, we review current insight into the host cell's retrograde trafficking pathway and how vacuolar pathogens of the genera Legionella, Coxiella, Salmonella, Chlamydia, and Simkania employ mechanistically distinct strategies to subvert this pathway, thus promoting intracellular survival and replication.","['Personnic N', 'Bärlocher K', 'Finsel I', 'Hilbi H']",2016,24,6,Trends Microbiol,"Personnic N, et al.

26915495,Fast label-free detection of Legionella spp. in biofilms by applying immunomagnetic beads and Raman spectroscopy.,"Legionellae colonize biofilms, can form a biofilm by itself and multiply intracellularly within the protozoa commonly found in water distribution systems. Approximately half of the known species are pathogenic and have been connected to severe multisystem Legionnaires' disease. The detection methods for Legionella spp. in water samples are still based on cultivation, which is time consuming due to the slow growth of this bacterium. Here, we developed a cultivation-independent, label-free and fast detection method for legionellae in a biofilm matrix based on the Raman spectroscopic analysis of isolated single cells via immunomagnetic separation (IMS). A database comprising the Raman spectra of single bacterial cells captured and separated from the biofilms formed by each species was used to build the identification method based on a support vector machine (SVM) discriminative classifier. The complete method allows the detection of Legionella spp. in 100 min. Cross-reactivity of Legionella spp. specific immunomagnetic beads to the other studied genera was tested, where only small cell amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli compared to the initial number of cells were isolated by the immunobeads. Nevertheless, the Raman spectra collected from isolated non-targeted bacteria were well-discriminated from the Raman spectra collected from isolated Legionella cells, whereby the Raman spectra of the independent dataset of Legionella strains were assigned with an accuracy of 98.6%. In addition, Raman spectroscopy was also used to differentiate between isolated Legionella species.","['Kusić D', 'Rösch P', 'Popp J']",2016,39,2,Syst Appl Microbiol,"Kusić D, et al.

Hence, hospital environment control procedures are effective measures for reducing nosocomial infections.
AIMS: This study was carried out to explore the profiles of microorganisms in air culture at various wards/units of a tertiary care hospital in Nepal.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at various wards/units of a tertiary care hospital in Nepal between January and September 2015 to explore the microbiological burden in inanimate objects. Each week one ward or unit was selected for the study. Bed, tap, the entire room, trolley, computer, phone, rack handles, table, chair, door, stethoscope, oxygen mask, gown, cupboard handles, and wash basins were selected for air culture testing. Ten different wards/units and 77 locations/pieces of equipment were selected for air culture by employing a simple random sampling technique. Information about the organisms was entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 22 (IBM: Armonk, NY) and descriptive analyses were carried out.
RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Micrococcus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CONS), Bacillus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yeast, and Acinetobacter were the most commonly detected organisms. In the postoperative ward, S. aureus was the most frequently detected microorganism. Micrococcus was detected in four out of 10 locations. In the x-ray unit, S. aureus was detected in three out of four locations.
CONCLUSION: S. aureus, Micrococcus, CONS, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, yeast, and Acinetobacter were the most common organisms detected.","['Sapkota B', 'Gupta GK', 'Shrestha SK', 'Pradhan A', 'Karki P', 'Thapa A']",2016,9,1,Australas Med J,"Sapkota B, et al.

Legionella (L.) pneumophila, serogroup (Sg) 1, monoclonal antibody (mAb) subgroup Knoxville, sequence type (ST) 345, was identified as the epidemic strain. This strain was isolated from seven patients. To detect the source of the infection, epidemiological typing of clinical and environmental strains was performed in two consecutive steps. First, strains were typed by monoclonal antibodies. Indistinguishable strains were further subtyped by sequence-based typing (SBT) which is the internationally recognized standard method for epidemiological genotyping of L. pneumophila. In an early stage of the outbreak investigation, many environmental isolates were found to belong to the mAb subgroup Knoxville, but to two different STs, namely to ST 345, the epidemic strain, and to ST 600. A majority of environmental isolates belonged to ST 600 whereas the epidemic ST 345 strain was less common in environmental samples. To rapidly distinguish both Knoxville strains, we applied a novel typing method based on DNA-hybridization on glass chips. The new assay can easily and rapidly discriminate L. pneumophila Sg 1 strains. Thus, we were able to quickly identify the sources harboring the epidemic strain, i.e., two cooling towers of different companies, the waste water treatment plants (WWTP) of the city and one company as well as water samples of the river Wester and its branches.","['Petzold M', 'Ehricht R', 'Slickers P', 'Pleischl S', 'Brockmann A', 'Exner M', 'Monecke S', 'Lück C']",2017,220,4,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Petzold M, et al.

26888563,Population structure and minimum core genome typing of Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is an important human pathogen causing Legionnaires' disease. In this study, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to study the characteristics and population structure of L. pneumophila strains. We sequenced and compared 53 isolates of L. pneumophila covering different serogroups and sequence-based typing (SBT) types (STs). We found that 1,896 single-copy orthologous genes were shared by all isolates and were defined as the minimum core genome (MCG) of L. pneumophila. A total of 323,224 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified among the 53 strains. After excluding 314,059 SNPs which were likely to be results of recombination, the remaining 9,165 SNPs were referred to as MCG SNPs. Population Structure analysis based on MCG divided the 53 L. pneumophila into nine MCG groups. The within-group distances were much smaller than the between-group distances, indicating considerable divergence between MCG groups. MCG groups were also supplied by phylogenetic analysis and may be considered as robust taxonomic units within L. pneumophila. Among the nine MCG groups, eight showed high intracellular growth ability while one showed low intracellular growth ability. Furthermore, MCG typing also showed high resolution in subtyping ST1 strains. The results obtained in this study provided significant insights into the evolution, population structure and pathogenicity of L. pneumophila.","['Qin T', 'Zhang W', 'Liu W', 'Zhou H', 'Ren H', 'Shao Z', 'Lan R', 'Xu J']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Qin T, et al.

26886069,"Quaternary Structure of Fur Proteins, a New Subfamily of Tetrameric Proteins.","The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) belongs to the family of the DNA-binding metal-responsive transcriptional regulators. Fur is a global regulator found in all proteobacteria. It controls the transcription of a wide variety of genes involved in iron metabolism but also in oxidative stress or virulence factor synthesis. When bound to ferrous iron, Fur can bind to specific DNA sequences, called Fur boxes. This binding triggers the repression or the activation of gene expression, depending on the regulated genes. As a general view, Fur proteins are considered to be dimeric proteins both in solution and when bound to DNA. In this study, we have purified Fur from four pathogenic strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, and Legionella pneumophila) and compared them to Fur from Escherichia coli (EcFur), the best characterized of this family. By using a series of ""in solution"" techniques, including multiangle laser light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering, as well as cross-linking experiments, we have shown that the Fur proteins can be classified into two groups, according to their quaternary structure. The group of dimers is represented by EcFur and YpFur and the group of very stable tetramers by PaFur, FtFur, and LpFur. Using PaFur as a case study, we also showed that the dissociation of the tetramers into dimers is necessary for binding of Fur to DNA, and that this dissociation requires the combined effect of metal ion binding and DNA proximity.","['Pérard J', 'Covès J', 'Castellan M', 'Solard C', 'Savard M', 'Miras R', 'Galop S', 'Signor L', 'Crouzy S', 'Michaud-Soret I', 'de Rosny E']",2016,55,10,Biochemistry,"Pérard J, et al.

26885236,Clinicopathological associations of acquired erythroblastopenia.,"INTRODUCTION: Acquired erythroblastopenia (AE) is a rare clinical situation. It is characterized by the reduction of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow together with the low reticulocyte counts in the peripheral blood.
BACKGROUND: Main secondary causes of AE are drugs, Parvovirus B19 and other infectious reasons, lymphoid and myeloid neoplasia, autoimmune diseases, thymoma and pregnancy. The aim of this study is to assess the frequencies and clinical associations of AE via analyzing 12340 bone marrow samples in a retrospective manner.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Bone marrow aspirations which were obtained from patients who applied to Hacettepe University Hematology Clinic between 2002 and 2013, were analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Thirty four erythroblastopenia cases were found. Patients ranged in age from 16 to 80 years with a median of 38 years. Fifteen patients were men (44%) and nineteen were women (56%). In these patients, detected causes of erythroblastopenia were MDS, idiopathic pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), parvovirus infection, post chemotherapy aplasia, plasma proliferative diseases, copper deficiency due to secondary amyloidosis, fever of unknown origin, hemophagocytic syndrome, enteric fever and legionella pneumonia. We found that between those reasons the most common causes of erythroblastopenia are MDS (17.7%) and idiopathic PRCA (17.7%).
DISCUSSION: As a result, erythroblastopenia in the bone marrow may be an early sign of MDS. In those AE cases possibility of being MDS must be kept in mind as it can be mistaken for PRCA.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, in adults MDS without excess blast is one of the most common causes of erythroblastopenia in clinical practice and in case of erythroblastopenia the presence of MDS should be investigated.","['Gunes G', 'Malkan UY', 'Yasar HA', 'Eliacik E', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Demiroglu H', 'Sayinalp N', 'Aksu S', 'Etgul S', 'Aslan T', 'Goker H', 'Ozcebe OI', 'Buyukasik Y']",2015,8,12,Int J Clin Exp Med,"Gunes G, et al.

26882544,Response to interferons and antibacterial innate immunity in the absence of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1.,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by directing the transcriptional response to interferons (IFNs). STAT1 is activated by Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated phosphorylation of Y701. To determine whether STAT1 contributes to cellular responses without this phosphorylation event, we generated mice with Y701 mutated to a phenylalanine (Stat1(Y701F)). We show that heterozygous mice do not exhibit a dominant-negative phenotype. Homozygous Stat1(Y701F) mice show a profound reduction in Stat1 expression, highlighting an important role for basal IFN-dependent signaling. The rapid transcriptional response to type I IFN (IFN-I) and type II IFN (IFNγ) was absent in Stat1(Y701F) cells. Intriguingly, STAT1Y701F suppresses the delayed expression of IFN-I-stimulated genes (ISG) observed in Stat1(-/-) cells, mediated by the STAT2/IRF9 complex. Thus, Stat1(Y701F) macrophages are more susceptible to Legionella pneumophila infection than Stat1(-/-) macrophages. Listeria monocytogenes grew less robustly in Stat1(Y701F) macrophages and mice compared to Stat1(-/-) counterparts, but STAT1Y701F is not sufficient to rescue the animals. Our studies are consistent with a potential contribution of Y701-unphosphorylated STAT1 to innate antibacterial immunity.","['Majoros A', 'Platanitis E', 'Szappanos D', 'Cheon H', 'Vogl C', 'Shukla P', 'Stark GR', 'Sexl V', 'Schreiber R', 'Schindler C', 'Müller M', 'Decker T']",2016,17,3,EMBO Rep,"Majoros A, et al.

26864322,Complex clinical and microbiological effects on Legionnaires' disease outcone; A retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease (LD) is associated with high mortality rates and poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Use of the rapid urinary antigen test (UAT) has been linked to improved outcome. We examined the association between the method of diagnosis (UAT or culture) and various clinical and microbiological characteristics and outcome of LD.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with pneumonia and confirmation of Legionella infection by a positive UAT and/or a positive culture admitted between the years 2006-2012 to a university hospital were retrospectively studied. Isolated L. pneumophila strains were subject to serogrouping, immunological subtyping and sequence-based typing. Variables associated with 30-day all-cause mortality were analyzed using logistic regression as well as cox regression.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were eligible for mortality analyses (LD study group), of whom 15.5 % have died. Diagnosis based on positive L. pneumophila UAT as compared to positive culture (OR = 0.18, 95 % CI 0.03-0.98, p = 0.05) and administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy within 2 hospitalization days as compared to delayed therapy (OR = 0.16, 95 % CI 0.03-0.90, p = 0.04) were independently associated with reduced mortality. When controlling for intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, the method of diagnosis became non-significant. Survival analyses showed a significantly increased death risk for patients admitted to ICU compared to others (HR 12.90, 95 % CI 2.78-59.86, p = 0.001) and reduced risk for patients receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy within the first two admissions days compared to delayed therapy (HR 0.13, 95 % CI 0.04-0.05, p = 0.001). Legionella cultures were positive in 35 patients (including 29 patients from the LD study group), of whom 65.7 % were intubated and 37.1 % have died. Sequence type (ST) ST1 accounted for 50.0 % of the typed cases and ST1, OLDA/Oxford was the leading phenon (53.8 %). Mortality rate among patients in the LD study group infected with ST1 was 18.2 % compared to 42.9 % for non-ST1 genotypes (OR = 0.30, 95 % CI 0.05-1.91, p = 0.23).
CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the importance of early administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and at the same time highlights the complex associations of different diagnostic approaches with LD outcome. Infection with ST1 was not associated with increased mortality.

26857395,Legionellosis in Transplantation.,"Legionella species are emerging opportunistic pathogens in hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The clinical and radiological features of Legionella infections can mimic other opportunistic pathogens in these profoundly immunocompromised patients. Diagnosis in transplant patients is challenging as non-pneumophila Legionella infections, for which these patients are at risk, cannot be identified using the urinary antigen test. Changes in management of transplant recipients and changes in Legionella epidemiology suggest that the number of transplant patients potentially exposed to Legionella spp. may be on the rise. Yet, evidence-based, transplant-specific guidelines for managing and preventing Legionella infections are not currently available.

In contrast, it is a 30-fold less potent inhibitor of nicotinic receptors incriminated in telithromycin toxicity. In Phase II/III trials, oral solithromycin once-daily (800 mg on day 1; 400 mg on days 2-5) proved effective and safe when compared to respiratory fluoroquinolones for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). A Phase III intravenous trial vs. moxifloxacin has been recently completed for the same indication. Solithromycin may restore interest in ketolides as a first-line therapy for CAPB.

26835793,Dental unit water treatment with hydrogen peroxide and monovalent silver ions artificially contaminated with freshly isolated pathogens.,"BACKGROUND: Dental unit water (DUW) could be contaminated by human pathogens coming from biological fluids penetrated during patient treatment and by opportunistic pathogens detached from aquatic biofilm. These microorganisms could be spread to following patients. We tested the disinfectant activity of hydrogen peroxide and monovalent silver ions (H(2)O(2)-Ag(+)) into DUW artificially contaminated with freshly isolated pathogens.
METHODS: The tested microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium chelonae, non-pathogenic Bacillus clausii spores. Bacterial suspensions were inoculated into the waterlines of pre-sterilized dental turbines. The test-turbines were connected to DUW and contaminated water was treated for 10 minutes with H(2)O(2)-Ag(+)-based disinfectant (H(2)O(2) 3% v/v, Ag(+) 0.001% w/v). The control-turbines were left untreated. Turbines were washed with sterile hard water used to assess the residual bacterial loads (expressed in colony forming units -cfu). Each strain was tested five times and the mean log loads were assessed. Following the European Standardization Committee, the disinfectant activity was evaluated as mean log load reduction, that is, the difference between the mean log load detected on the control-turbines and the mean log load detected on the test-turbines.
RESULTS: Mean bacterial loads detected on the control-turbines ranged between 105-107 cfu. The mean log load reductions resulted 7.5 log cfu for S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, 6.3 for C. albicans, 5.4 for L. pneumophila, 5.3 for M. chelonae, 2.9 for B. clausii spores.

26834713,Genomic Investigation of a Legionellosis Outbreak in a Persistently Colonized Hotel.,"OBJECTIVES: A long-lasting legionellosis outbreak was reported between November 2011 and July 2012 in a hotel in Calpe (Spain) affecting 44 patients including six deaths. Intensive epidemiological and microbiological investigations were performed in order to detect the reservoirs.
METHODS: Clinical and environmental samples were tested for the presence and genetic characterization of Legionella pneumophila. Six of the isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing.
RESULTS: Sequencing of 14 clinical and 260 environmental samples revealed sequence type (ST) 23 as the main responsible strain for the infections. This ST was found in the spa pool, from where it spread to other hotel public spaces, explaining the ST23 clinical cases, including guests who had not visited the spa. Uncultured clinical specimens showed profiles compatible with ST23, ST578, and mixed patterns. Profiles compatible with ST578 were obtained by direct sequencing from biofilm samples collected from the domestic water system, which provided evidence for the source of infection for non ST23 patients. Whole genome data from five ST23 strains and the identification of different STs and Legionella species showed that different hotel premises were likely colonized since the hotel opening thus explaining how different patients had been infected by distinct STs.
CONCLUSIONS: Both epidemiological and molecular data are essential in the investigation of legionellosis outbreaks. Whole-genome sequencing data revealed significant intra-ST variability and allowed to make further inference on the short-term evolution of a local colonization of L. pneumophila.","['Sánchez-Busó L', 'Guiral S', 'Crespi S', 'Moya V', 'Camaró ML', 'Olmos MP', 'Adrián F', 'Morera V', 'González-Morán F', 'Vanaclocha H', 'González-Candelas F']",2015,6,,Front Microbiol,"Sánchez-Busó L, et al.

Free-living amoebae are protozoa also found in water, which feed on bacteria by phagocytosis. Under favorable conditions, some L. pneumophila are able to resist phagocytic digestion and even multiply within amoebae. However, it is not clear whether L. pneumophila could infect at a same rate a large range of amoebae or if there is some selectivity towards specific amoebal genera or strains. Also, most studies have been performed using collection strains and not with freshly isolated strains. In our study, we assess the permissiveness of freshly isolated environmental strains of amoebae, belonging to three common genera (i.e. Acanthamoeba, Naegleria and Vermamoeba), for growth of L. pneumophila at three different temperatures. Our results indicated that all the tested strains of amoebae were permissive to L. pneumophila Lens and that there was no significant difference between the strains. Intracellular proliferation was more efficient at a temperature of 40°C. In conclusion, our work suggests that, under favorable conditions, virulent strains of L. pneumophila could equally infect a large number of isolates of common freshwater amoeba genera.","['Dupuy M', 'Binet M', 'Bouteleux C', 'Herbelin P', 'Soreau S', 'Héchard Y']",2016,363,5,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Dupuy M, et al.

26831115,Legionella pneumophila S1P-lyase targets host sphingolipid metabolism and restrains autophagy.,"Autophagy is an essential component of innate immunity, enabling the detection and elimination of intracellular pathogens. Legionella pneumophila, an intracellular pathogen that can cause a severe pneumonia in humans, is able to modulate autophagy through the action of effector proteins that are translocated into the host cell by the pathogen's Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. Many of these effectors share structural and sequence similarity with eukaryotic proteins. Indeed, phylogenetic analyses have indicated their acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryotic host. Here we report that L. pneumophila translocates the effector protein sphingosine-1 phosphate lyase (LpSpl) to target the host sphingosine biosynthesis and to curtail autophagy. Our structural characterization of LpSpl and its comparison with human SPL reveals high structural conservation, thus supporting prior phylogenetic analysis. We show that LpSpl possesses S1P lyase activity that was abrogated by mutation of the catalytic site residues. L. pneumophila triggers the reduction of several sphingolipids critical for macrophage function in an LpSpl-dependent and -independent manner. LpSpl activity alone was sufficient to prevent an increase in sphingosine levels in infected host cells and to inhibit autophagy during macrophage infection. LpSpl was required for efficient infection of A/J mice, highlighting an important virulence role for this effector. Thus, we have uncovered a previously unidentified mechanism used by intracellular pathogens to inhibit autophagy, namely the disruption of host sphingolipid biosynthesis.","['Rolando M', 'Escoll P', 'Nora T', 'Botti J', 'Boitez V', 'Bedia C', 'Daniels C', 'Abraham G', 'Stogios PJ', 'Skarina T', 'Christophe C', 'Dervins-Ravault D', 'Cazalet C', 'Hilbi H', 'Rupasinghe TW', 'Tull D', 'McConville MJ', 'Ong SY', 'Hartland EL', 'Codogno P', 'Levade T', 'Naderer T', 'Savchenko A', 'Buchrieser C']",2016,113,7,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Rolando M, et al.

26830989,A Pilot Study of Quantitative Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification-guided Target Therapies for Hospital-acquired Pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: It is important to achieve the definitive pathogen identification in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), but the traditional culture results always delay the target antibiotic therapy. We assessed the method called quantitative loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qLAMP) as a new implement for steering of the antibiotic decision-making in HAP.
METHODS: Totally, 76 respiratory tract aspiration samples were prospectively collected from 60 HAP patients. DNA was isolated from these samples. Specific DNA fragments for identifying 11 pneumonia-related bacteria were amplified by qLAMP assay. Culture results of these patients were compared with the qLAMP results. Clinical data and treatment strategies were analyzed to evaluate the effects of qLAMP results on clinical data. McNemar test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The detection of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Acinetobacter baumannii by qLAMP was consistent with sputum culture (P > 0.05). The qLAMP results of 4 samples for Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, or Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) were inconsistent with culture results; however, clinical data revealed that the qLAMP results were all reliable except 1 MP positive sample due to the lack of specific species identified in the final diagnosis. The improvement of clinical condition was more significant (P < 0.001) in patients with pathogen target-driven therapy based on qLAMP results than those with empirical therapy.
CONCLUSION: qLAMP is a more promising method for detection of pathogens in an early, rapid, sensitive, and specific manner than culture.","['Wang F', 'Li R', 'Shang Y', 'Wang C', 'Wang GQ', 'Zhou DX', 'Yang DH', 'Xi W', 'Wang KQ', 'Bao J', 'Kang Y', 'Gao ZC']",2016,129,2,Chin Med J (Engl),"Wang F, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Monospecies legionella biofilms, obtained in plates for enzyme immunoassay during 96 hours at 28 degrees C, and water suspension of BCYE agar cultivated cells of L. pneumophila at a concentration of 10(3) - 10(5) CFU per liter were used in the study for evaluation of bactericidal effect of temperature on various legionella forms.
RESULTS: Analysis of effects of various temperature regimens on plankton forms and model legionella biofilms has shown that at a temperature range from 50 to 60 degrees C a significant reduction of quantity of viable legionella cells occurs. Model legionella biofilms have partially conserved viability at a temperature of 60 degrees C and only exposition to a temperature of 70 degrees C resulted in death of legionella biofilms and plankton forms of bacteria. A dependence of viability conservation of legionella from the initial concentration of the causative agent in water and duration of exposition at varying temperature was shown.
CONCLUSION: Short-term heating at a temperature of at least 70 degrees C has the most pronounced bactericidal effect on plankton forms and model L. pneumophila biofilms under experimental conditions.

Here we show that type I and II IFNs are master regulators of gene expression during Legionella pneumophila infection, and activators of an alveolar macrophage-intrinsic immune response that restricts bacterial growth during pneumonia. Quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that both IFNs substantially modify Legionella-containing vacuoles, and comparative analyses reveal distinct subsets of transcriptionally and spatially IFN-regulated proteins. Immune-responsive gene (IRG)1 is induced by IFNs in mitochondria that closely associate with Legionella-containing vacuoles, and mediates production of itaconic acid. This metabolite is bactericidal against intravacuolar L. pneumophila as well as extracellular multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Our study explores the overall role IFNs play in inducing substantial remodeling of bacterial vacuoles and in stimulating production of IRG1-derived itaconic acid which targets intravacuolar pathogens. IRG1 or its product itaconic acid might be therapeutically targetable to fight intracellular and drug-resistant bacteria.","['Naujoks J', 'Tabeling C', 'Dill BD', 'Hoffmann C', 'Brown AS', 'Kunze M', 'Kempa S', 'Peter A', 'Mollenkopf HJ', 'Dorhoi A', 'Kershaw O', 'Gruber AD', 'Sander LE', 'Witzenrath M', 'Herold S', 'Nerlich A', 'Hocke AC', 'van Driel I', 'Suttorp N', 'Bedoui S', 'Hilbi H', 'Trost M', 'Opitz B']",2016,12,2,PLoS Pathog,"Naujoks J, et al.

26826646,Impact of water quality on chlorine demand of corroding copper.,"Copper is widely used in drinking water premise plumbing system materials. In buildings such as hospitals, large and complicated plumbing networks make it difficult to maintain good water quality. Sustaining safe disinfectant residuals throughout a building to protect against waterborne pathogens such as Legionella is particularly challenging since copper and other reactive distribution system materials can exert considerable demands. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of pH and orthophosphate on the consumption of free chlorine associated with corroding copper pipes over time. A copper test-loop pilot system was used to control test conditions and systematically meet the study objectives. Chlorine consumption trends attributed to abiotic reactions with copper over time were different for each pH condition tested, and the total amount of chlorine consumed over the test runs increased with increasing pH. Orthophosphate eliminated chlorine consumption trends with elapsed time (i.e., chlorine demand was consistent across entire test runs). Orthophosphate also greatly reduced the total amount of chlorine consumed over the test runs. Interestingly, the total amount of chlorine consumed and the consumption rate were not pH dependent when orthophosphate was present. The findings reflect the complex and competing reactions at the copper pipe wall including corrosion, oxidation of Cu(I) minerals and ions, and possible oxidation of Cu(II) minerals, and the change in chlorine species all as a function of pH. The work has practical applications for maintaining chlorine residuals in premise plumbing drinking water systems including large buildings such as hospitals.","['Lytle DA', 'Liggett J']",2016,92,,Water Res,Lytle DA and Liggett J.

26793950,Use of Tracheal Aspirate Culture in Newly Intubated Patients with Community-Onset Pneumonia.,"RATIONALE: Successful treatment of life-threatening community-acquired pneumonia requires appropriate empiric antibiotic coverage. But using conventional diagnostic techniques, a microbiological diagnosis is often not achieved. The diagnostic usefulness of tracheal aspirate at the time of intubation in patients with severe pneumonia has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of tracheal aspirate culture in identifying pneumonia pathogens.
METHODS: We identified all patients older than 18 years of age with International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision codes and radiographic evidence of pneumonia seen in the emergency departments at 2 university-affiliated Utah hospitals from December 2009 to November 2010 and from December 2011 to November 2012. Patients intubated within 24 hours of arrival were then identified electronically. Postintubation orders instructed respiratory therapists to obtain tracheal aspirate for culture. All culture results were reviewed individually and defined as positive if a pneumonia pathogen was identified. Results of other microbiology studies were obtained from the electronic medical record.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 2,011 patients with pneumonia, 94 were intubated and 84 had a tracheal aspirate obtained. Of these 84 patients, 47 (56%) had a pulmonary pathogen identified by tracheal aspirate culture, 80 also had blood cultures, and 71 underwent Pneumococcal and Legionella urinary antigen testing. A microbiological diagnosis was made in 55 patients (65.5%) by any diagnostic method. In 39% of patients (32 of 82), the tracheal aspirate culture was the only positive test, resulting in a unique microbiological diagnosis in patients who would have otherwise been classified as ""culture negative.""
CONCLUSIONS: Tracheal aspirate cultures obtained as part of routine care identified a plausible pneumonia pathogen in more than one-half of emergency department adult patients with severe pneumonia requiring intubation. Tracheal aspirate culture offers important additive diagnostic value to other routine tests.","['McCauley LM', 'Webb BJ', 'Sorensen J', 'Dean NC']",2016,13,3,Ann Am Thorac Soc,"McCauley LM, et al.

26792862,Growth-related Metabolism of the Carbon Storage Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate in Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires disease, has a biphasic life cycle with a switch from a replicative to a transmissive phenotype. During the replicative phase, the bacteria grow within host cells in Legionella-containing vacuoles. During the transmissive phenotype and the postexponential (PE) growth phase, the pathogens express virulence factors, become flagellated, and leave the Legionella-containing vacuoles. Using (13)C labeling experiments, we now show that, under in vitro conditions, serine is mainly metabolized during the replicative phase for the biosynthesis of some amino acids and for energy generation. During the PE phase, these carbon fluxes are reduced, and glucose also serves as an additional carbon substrate to feed the biosynthesis of poly-3-hydroxybuyrate (PHB), an essential carbon source for transmissive L. pneumophila. Whole-cell FTIR analysis and comparative isotopologue profiling further reveal that a putative 3-ketothiolase (Lpp1788) and a PHB polymerase (Lpp0650), but not enzymes of the crotonyl-CoA pathway (Lpp0931-0933) are involved in PHB metabolism during the PE phase. However, the data also reflect that additional bypassing reactions for PHB synthesis exist in agreement with in vivo competition assays using Acanthamoeba castellannii or human macrophage-like U937 cells as host cells. The data suggest that substrate usage and PHB metabolism are coordinated during the life cycle of the pathogen.","['Gillmaier N', 'Schunder E', 'Kutzner E', 'Tlapák H', 'Rydzewski K', 'Herrmann V', 'Stämmler M', 'Lasch P', 'Eisenreich W', 'Heuner K']",2016,291,12,J Biol Chem,"Gillmaier N, et al.

The structure of the bacterial enzyme does not possess a lysine residue in the active center and thus does not form an enzyme-substrate Schiff base intermediate as observed for the DHS. In contrast to the DHS the active site is not formed by the interface of two subunits but resides within one subunit of the bacterial HSS. Crystal structures of Blastochloris viridis HSS (BvHSS) reveal two distinct substrate binding sites, one of which is highly specific for putrescine. BvHSS features a side pocket in the direct vicinity of the active site formed by conserved amino acids and a potential substrate discrimination, guiding, and sensing mechanism. The proposed reaction steps for the catalysis of BvHSS emphasize cation-π interaction through a conserved Trp residue as a key stabilizer of high energetic transition states.","['Krossa S', 'Faust A', 'Ober D', 'Scheidig AJ']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Krossa S, et al.

26775932,"Prevalence and distribution of Legionella spp in potable water systems in Germany, risk factors associated with contamination, and effectiveness of thermal disinfection.","BACKGROUND: Worldwide, Legionella spp are a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Potable water systems are a main reservoir; however, exposure in the community is unknown.
METHODS: Water samples from 718 buildings in Germany were collected. Possible risk factors were prospectively recorded. All samples were tested for Legionella spp using cultural microbiologic methods. Samples were assigned to 1 of 5 levels of contamination. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the influence of risk factors for contamination and, in a subgroup of buildings, for unsuccessful thermal disinfection.
RESULTS: In total, 4,482 water samples from 718 different water supply systems were analyzed. In 233 buildings (32.7%), Legionella spp were identified, 148 (63.5%) of which had a medium or higher level of contamination. The most common species was Legionella pneumophila (94%). Contamination was strongly associated with temperature in the circulation, but not with the size of the building, time of the year, or transport time to the laboratory. Thermal disinfection was successful in fewer than half of the buildings.
CONCLUSIONS: There is relevant exposure to Legionella spp in the community. Water systems are not always up to current technical standards. Although microbiological risk assessment remains a challenge, there is a case for monitoring for Legionella spp outside of hospitals.","['Kruse EB', 'Wehner A', 'Wisplinghoff H']",2016,44,4,Am J Infect Control,"Kruse EB, et al.

26762760,At the crossroads: communication of bacteria-containing vacuoles with host organelles.,"Invasive bacterial pathogens are engulfed upon host cell entry in a vacuolar environment called the bacteria-containing vacuole (BCV). BCVs directly contact with numerous host compartments, mainly vesicles of the endocytic pathway, such as endosomes or lysosomes. In addition, they also interact with the endoplasmic reticulum and endomembranes of the secretory pathway. These connections between the pathogen and the host occur either through heterotypic membrane fusions or through membrane contact sites. The precise regulation of BCV contacts with host compartments defines the constitution of the intracellular bacterial niche. It emerges that the associated pathways may control the stability of the BCV resulting either in vacuolar or cytoplasmically growing bacteria. Here, we will portray how the usage of novel proteomics and imaging technologies allows comparison of the communication of different host cell compartments with four relevant intracellular human pathogens, namely Salmonella enterica, Legionella pneumophila, Shigella flexneri and Francisella tularensis. The first two remain mainly within the BCV, and the latter two escape into the cytoplasm.","['Santos JC', 'Enninga J']",2016,18,3,Cell Microbiol,Santos JC and Enninga J.

Virulence genes are frequently associated with bacterial pathogenicity in genus Legionella. In the present study, an assay was performed to detect ten virulence genes, including iraA, iraB, lvrA, lvrB, lvhD, cpxR, cpxA, dotA, icmC and icmD in different pathogenicity islands of 47 Legionella reference strains, 235 environmental strains isolated from water, and 4 clinical strains isolated from the lung tissue of pneumonia patients. The distribution frequencies of these genes in reference or/and environmental L. pneumophila strains were much higher than those in reference non-L. pneumophila or/and environmental non-L. pneumophila strains, respectively. L. pneumophila clinical strains also maintained higher frequencies of these genes compared to four other types of Legionella strains. Distribution frequencies of these genes in reference L. pneumophila strains were similar to those in environmental L. pneumophila strains. In contrast, environmental non-L. pneumophila maintained higher frequencies of these genes compared to those found in reference non-L. pneumophila strains. This study illustrates the association of virulence genes with Legionella pathogenicity and reveals the possible virulence evolution of non-L. pneumophia strains isolated from environmental water.","['Zhan XY', 'Hu CH', 'Zhu QY']",2016,198,3,Arch Microbiol,"Zhan XY, et al.

However, almost no information exists regarding effectors in other Legionella pathogens. Here we sequenced, assembled and characterized the genomes of 38 Legionella species and predicted their effector repertoires using a previously validated machine learning approach. This analysis identified 5,885 predicted effectors. The effector repertoires of different Legionella species were found to be largely non-overlapping, and only seven core effectors were shared by all species studied. Species-specific effectors had atypically low GC content, suggesting exogenous acquisition, possibly from the natural protozoan hosts of these species. Furthermore, we detected numerous new conserved effector domains and discovered new domain combinations, which allowed the inference of as yet undescribed effector functions. The effector collection and network of domain architectures described here can serve as a roadmap for future studies of effector function and evolution.","['Burstein D', 'Amaro F', 'Zusman T', 'Lifshitz Z', 'Cohen O', 'Gilbert JA', 'Pupko T', 'Shuman HA', 'Segal G']",2016,48,2,Nat Genet,"Burstein D, et al.

26740925,Legionella spp. isolation and quantification from greywater.,"Legionella, an opportunistic human pathogen whose natural environment is water, is transmitted to humans through inhalation of contaminated aerosols. Legionella has been isolated from a high diversity of water types. Due its importance as a pathogen, two ISO protocols have been developed for its monitoring. However, these two protocols are not suitable for analyzing Legionella in greywater (GW). GW is domestic wastewater excluding the inputs from toilets and kitchen. It can serve as an alternative water source, mainly for toilet flushing and garden irrigation; both producing aerosols that can cause a risk for Legionella infection. Hence, before reuse, GW has to be treated and its quality needs to be monitored. The difficulty of Legionella isolation from GW strives in the very high load of contaminant bacteria. Here we describe a modification of the ISO protocol 11731:1998 that enables the isolation and quantification of Legionella from GW samples. The following modifications were made:•To enable isolation of Legionella from greywater, a pre-filtration step that removes coarse matter is recommended.•Legionella can be isolated after a combined acid-thermic treatment that eliminates the high load of contaminant bacteria in the sample.","['Rodríguez-Martínez S', 'Blanky M', 'Friedler E', 'Halpern M']",2015,2,,MethodsX,"Rodríguez-Martínez S, et al.

The research included data collection on the technical and technological characteristics in the period from 2009 to 2012. The survey included a type of construction material for the distribution and internal networks, heating system water heater type, and water consumption. Changes in water quality were monitored by determination of the physical and chemical parameters (temperature, pH, free chlorine residual concentrations, iron, zinc, copper and manganese) in the samples, as well as the presence and concentration of bacteria Legionella spp. The temperature is an important factor for the development of biofilms, and it is in negative correlation with the appearance of Legionella spp. Positive correlations between the Fe and Zn concentrations and Legionella spp. were established, while the inhibitory effect of a higher Cu concentration on the Legionella spp. concentration was proven. Legionella spp. were identified in 38/126 (30.2%) of the water samples from the heating system with zinc-coated pipes, as well as in 78/299 (26.1%) of the samples from systems with plastic pipes. A similar number of Legionella spp. positive samples were established regardless of the type of the water heating system (central or independent).

26729716,Ultrafiltration and Microarray for Detection of Microbial Source Tracking Marker and Pathogen Genes in Riverine and Marine Systems.,"Pathogen identification and microbial source tracking (MST) to identify sources of fecal pollution improve evaluation of water quality. They contribute to improved assessment of human health risks and remediation of pollution sources. An MST microarray was used to simultaneously detect genes for multiple pathogens and indicators of fecal pollution in freshwater, marine water, sewage-contaminated freshwater and marine water, and treated wastewater. Dead-end ultrafiltration (DEUF) was used to concentrate organisms from water samples, yielding a recovery efficiency of >95% for Escherichia coli and human polyomavirus. Whole-genome amplification (WGA) increased gene copies from ultrafiltered samples and increased the sensitivity of the microarray. Viruses (adenovirus, bocavirus, hepatitis A virus, and human polyomaviruses) were detected in sewage-contaminated samples. Pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Shigella flexneri, and Campylobacter fetus were detected along with genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and tetracycline. Nonmetric dimensional analysis of MST marker genes grouped sewage-spiked freshwater and marine samples with sewage and apart from other fecal sources. The sensitivity (percent true positives) of the microarray probes for gene targets anticipated in sewage was 51 to 57% and was lower than the specificity (percent true negatives; 79 to 81%). A linear relationship between gene copies determined by quantitative PCR and microarray fluorescence was found, indicating the semiquantitative nature of the MST microarray. These results indicate that ultrafiltration coupled with WGA provides sufficient nucleic acids for detection of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and antibiotic resistance genes by the microarray in applications ranging from beach monitoring to risk assessment.","['Li X', 'Harwood VJ', 'Nayak B', 'Weidhaas JL']",2016,82,5,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Li X, et al.

26724441,Prevalence of Legionella in premise plumbing in Hungary.,"Legionella is one of the emerging concerns of water quality in built water environments. Premise plumbing systems are among the recognised sources of infection. In the present study, colonisation of hot water networks in health care facilities, schools, hotels, private residences, office and industrial buildings was investigated. Data was analysed in connection with building and premise plumbing characteristics. Over 60% of all buildings were colonised by Legionella; counts were over 1000 CFU/L in 49%. The most prevalent type was Legionella pneumophila serogroup 2-14, isolated from 75% of the positive samples. Centrally produced hot water was found to be a key risk factor (46% of the samples were positive vs. 16% in individual systems); within this group the type of the building was less relevant. Colonisation levels in schools were similar to hotels or hospitals, representing a previously underestimated risk setting. Systems supplied by water from deep groundwater sources were significantly less likely to be colonised than more vulnerable sources (bank-wall filtration, surface water abstraction or karstic water; 28% vs. 51% positive), regardless of the type of treatment applied, including the presence of disinfection. The aggravating effect of larger, more complex and older buildings on colonisation was also confirmed. The present study represents the first baseline analysis, pre-empting regulation or monitoring requirements for Legionella. The prevalence of legionellae and the identified risk factors are indicative for other settings lacking targeted interventions. The statistically confirmed risk factors can serve as indicators for preliminary risk assessment and the prioritisation of interventions.","['Barna Z', 'Kádár M', 'Kálmán E', 'Scheirich Szax A', 'Vargha M']",2016,90,,Water Res,"Barna Z, et al.

26717079,Serological and molecular identification of Legionella spp. isolated from water and surrounding air samples in Italian healthcare facilities.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella is an intracellular microorganism living in natural and artificial aquatic environments. Although its transmission to humans is linked to the inhalation of contaminated aerosols, there is no validated air sampling method for the control and prevention of the disease. The aim of the present study was to provide more information on the distribution of Legionella spp. in indoor environments and to determine whether the same Legionella strains are isolated from air and water samples.
METHODS: Ten healthcare facilities located in seven regions of Italy were enrolled. The serological typing of Legionella spp. from water samples and the surrounding air by active and passive sampling was assessed using polyvalent and monovalent antisera. Subsequently, the strains identified as Legionella pneumophila (Lpn) underwent molecular typing by sequence-based typing (SBT) using seven genes (flaA, pilE, asd, mip, mompS, proA, and neuA). The allelic profile number was assigned using the European Working Group for Legionella Infections-SBT database.
RESULTS: Lpn serogroup 6 was the most prevalent serogroup; it was found simultaneously in the air and water samples of three different healthcare facilities. In the remaining seven hospitals, Lpn serogroups 1, 6, 7, 9, and 12 were isolated exclusively from water samples. The molecular investigation showed that Lpn strains in the water and air samples of each positive healthcare facility had the same allelic profile. Strains, identified as sequence types (STs) 728 and ST 1638+ST 1324, were isolated in two respective healthcare facilities, and a new strain, identified as ST 1989, was obtained in one healthcare facility.
CONCLUSION: The application of the SBT method allowed to verify the homology among Legionella strains from water samples and the surrounding air. The results showed that the same Lpn strains were present in the air and water samples, and a new Legionella strain was identified.","['Montagna MT', 'Cristina ML', 'De Giglio O', 'Spagnolo AM', 'Napoli C', 'Cannova L', 'Deriu MG', 'Delia SA', 'Giuliano A', 'Guida M', 'Laganà P', 'Liguori G', 'Mura I', 'Pennino F', 'Rossini A', 'Tardivo S', 'Torre I', 'Torregrossa MV', 'Villafrate MR', 'Albertini R', 'Pasquarella C']",2016,146,,Environ Res,"Montagna MT, et al.

Suspecting Legionnaires' disease (LD), CDPH advised the hotel to close their swimming pool, spa, and decorative lobby fountain and began an investigation. Methods.  Case finding included notification of individuals potentially exposed during July 16-August 15, 2012. Individuals were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire.

In this study, we expanded the pool of L. pneumophila CpxR-regulated genes to 38, including 27 effector-encoding genes. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the CpxR dual regulator has different requirements for activation and repression of target genes. These differences include the positioning of the CpxR regulatory element relative to the promoter element, and the effect of CpxR phosphate donors on the expression of CpxR target genes. In addition, unlike most response regulators, a mutant form of the L. pneumophila CpxR which cannot be phosphorylated was found to self-interact, and to repress gene expression similarly to wild-type CpxR, even though its ability to activate gene expression was reduced. Moreover, the CpxRA TCS was found to activate the expression of LetE which was found to function as a connector protein between the CpxRA TCS and the LetAS-RsmYZ-CsrA regulatory cascade. Our results show that CpxR plays a major role in L. pneumophila pathogenesis gene expression and functions as part of a regulatory network.","['Feldheim YS', 'Zusman T', 'Speiser Y', 'Segal G']",2016,99,6,Mol Microbiol,"Feldheim YS, et al.

26706971,Geostatistics - a tool applied to the distribution of Legionella pneumophila in a hospital water system.,"INTRODUCTION: Legionnaires' disease is normally acquired by inhalation of legionellae from a contaminated environmental source. Water systems of large buildings, such as hospitals, are often contaminated with legionellae and therefore represent a potential risk for the hospital population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential contamination of Legionella pneumophila (LP) in a large hospital in Italy through georeferential statistical analysis to assess the possible sources of dispersion and, consequently, the risk of exposure for both health care staff and patients.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: LP serogroups 1 and 2-14 distribution was considered in the wards housed on two consecutive floors of the hospital building. On the basis of information provided by 53 bacteriological analysis, a 'random' grid of points was chosen and spatial geostatistics or FAIk Kriging was applied and compared with the results of classical statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Over 50% of the examined samples were positive for Legionella pneumophila. LP 1 was isolated in 69% of samples from the ground floor and in 60% of sample from the first floor; LP 2-14 in 36% of sample from the ground floor and 24% from the first. The iso-estimation maps show clearly the most contaminated pipe and the difference in the diffusion of the different L. pneumophila serogroups.
CONCLUSION: Experimental work has demonstrated that geostatistical methods applied to the microbiological analysis of water matrices allows a better modeling of the phenomenon under study, a greater potential for risk management and a greater choice of methods of prevention and environmental recovery to be put in place with respect to the classical statistical analysis.","['Laganà P', 'Moscato U', 'Poscia A', 'La Milia DI', 'Boccia S', 'Avventuroso E', 'Delia S']",2015,22,4,Ann Agric Environ Med,"Laganà P, et al.

26706346,In sílico identification and characterization of putative Dot/Icm secreted virulence effectors in the fish pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis.,"Piscirickettsia salmonis seriously affects the Chilean salmon industry. The bacterium is phylogenetically related to Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii, sharing a Dot/Icm secretion system with them. Although it is well documented that L. pneumophila and C. burnetii secrete different virulence effectors via this Dot/Icm system in order to attenuate host cell responses, to date there have been no reported virulence effectors secreted by the Dot/Icm system of P. salmonis. Using several annotations of P. salmonis genome, here we report an in silico analyses of 4 putative Dot/Icm effectors. Three of them contain ankyrin repeat domains and the typical conserved 3D structures of this protein family. The fourth one is highly similar to one of the Dot/Icm-dependent effectors of L. pneumophila. Additionally, all the potential P. salmonis effectors contain a classical Dot/Icm secretion signal in their C-terminus, consisting of: an E-Block, a hydrophobic residue in -3 or -4 and an electronegative charge. Finally, qPCR analysis demonstrated that these proteins are overexpressed early in infection, perhaps contributing to the generation of a replicative vacuole, a key step in the neutralizing strategy proposed for the Dot/Icm system. In summary, this report identifies four Dot/Icm-dependent effectors in P. salmonis.","['Labra Á', 'Arredondo-Zelada O', 'Flores-Herrera P', 'Marshall SH', 'Gómez FA']",2016,92,,Microb Pathog,"Labra Á, et al.

26703696,Legionella pneumophila Seropositivity-Associated Factors in Latvian Blood Donors.,"Continuous environmental exposure of humans to Legionella may induce immune responses and generation of antibodies. The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of Legionella pneumophila serogroups (SG) 1-6 in the general healthy population and identify the associated host-related and environmental risk factors. L. pneumophila SG 1-6 seroprevalence among a total of 2007 blood samples collected from healthy donors was 4.8%. Seroprevalence was higher in women (5.9%) than men (3.3%) and in areas with a larger number of inhabitants, ranging from 3.5% in rural regions to 6.8% in the capital, Riga. Blood samples from inhabitants of apartment buildings tested positive for L. pneumophila in more cases (5.8%) compared to those from inhabitants of single-family homes (2.7%). Residents of buildings with a municipal hot water supply system were more likely to be seropositive for L. pneumophila (OR = 3.16, 95% CI 1.26-7.91). Previous episodes of fever were additionally identified as a risk factor (OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.43-4.1). In conclusion, centralized hot water supply, female gender and previous episodes of fever were determined as the main factors associated with L. pneumophila seropositivity in our study population.","['Valciņa O', 'Pūle D', 'Lucenko I', 'Krastiņa D', 'Šteingolde Ž', 'Krūmiņa A', 'Bērziņš A']",2015,13,1,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Valciņa O, et al.

26703014,[To evaluate the auxiliary diagnostic value of Japanese respiratory society scoring system for the rapid diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in inpatients with community acquired pneumonia].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the auxiliary diagnostic value of Japanese respiratory society (JRS) scoring system for the rapid diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) in inpatients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP).
METHODS: The clinical data of inpatients with CAP between January 2013 and Novermber 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. The gold standard for identification of MP infection was determined by both positive culture and real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Blood and sputum culture were used to detect other bacteria and fungi, and real time PCR to detect Chlamydia and Legionella pneumonia and the common respiratory viruses. Diagnostic test results consistency inspection was performed by Kappa test and continuous variable analysis was performed using t test.
RESULTS: Data from 139 CAP inpatients were analyzed. An aetiological diagnosis was made for 61 patients (43.9%). Thirty-five cases (25.2%) were diagnosed as MP infection by the gold standard, while 72 cases (52.0%) by the JRS scoring system. The sensitivity of JRS scoring system for the diagnosis of MP infection was 85.7% (30/35), specificity 59.6% (62/104), positive predictive value 41.7% (30/72)and negative predictive value 92.5% (62/67). According to age, for the patients younger than 40 years old, the sensitivity of JRS routine scoring system for the diagnosis of MP infection was 24/24, specificity was 4/29, positive predictive value 24/49 and negative predictive value was 4/4.
CONCLUSIONS: The JRS scoring system provides an auxiliary value for the identification of MP pneumonia. It has a high sensitivity and a strong negative predictive value. For patients younger than 40 yrs with low grades of JRS swring system. MP infection can be almost excluded from.","['Yuan X', 'Jin X', 'Niu W', 'Cui Q', 'Liu H', 'Zheng J', 'Heng Z', 'Bai C']",2015,38,7,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,"Yuan X, et al.

26698649,Evolution of the methyl directed mismatch repair system in Escherichia coli.,"DNA mismatch repair (MMR) repairs mispaired bases in DNA generated by replication errors. MutS or MutS homologs recognize mispairs and coordinate with MutL or MutL homologs to direct excision of the newly synthesized DNA strand. In most organisms, the signal that discriminates between the newly synthesized and template DNA strands has not been definitively identified. In contrast, Escherichia coli and some related gammaproteobacteria use a highly elaborated methyl-directed MMR system that recognizes Dam methyltransferase modification sites that are transiently unmethylated on the newly synthesized strand after DNA replication. Evolution of methyl-directed MMR is characterized by the acquisition of Dam and the MutH nuclease and by the loss of the MutL endonuclease activity. Methyl-directed MMR is present in a subset of Gammaproteobacteria belonging to the orders Enterobacteriales, Pasteurellales, Vibrionales, Aeromonadales, and a subset of the Alteromonadales (the EPVAA group) as well as in gammaproteobacteria that have obtained these genes by horizontal gene transfer, including the medically relevant bacteria Fluoribacter, Legionella, and Tatlockia and the marine bacteria Methylophaga and Nitrosococcus.",['Putnam CD'],2016,38,,DNA Repair (Amst),Putnam CD.

26691313,Pathway analysis using (13) C-glycerol and other carbon tracers reveals a bipartite metabolism of Legionella pneumophila.,"Amino acids represent the prime carbon and energy source for Legionella pneumophila, a facultative intracellular pathogen, which can cause a life-threatening pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. Genome, transcriptome and proteome studies indicate that L. pneumophila also utilizes carbon substrates other than amino acids. We show here that glycerol promotes intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in amoeba or macrophages (but not extracellular growth) dependent on glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GlpD. An L. pneumophila mutant strain lacking glpD was outcompeted by wild-type bacteria upon co-infection of amoeba, indicating an important role of glycerol during infection. Isotopologue profiling studies using (13) C-labelled substrates were performed in a novel minimal defined medium, MDM, comprising essential amino acids, proline and phenylalanine. In MDM, L. pneumophila utilized (13) C-labelled glycerol or glucose predominantly for gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway, while the amino acid serine was used for energy generation via the citrate cycle. Similar results were obtained for L. pneumophila growing intracellularly in amoeba fed with (13) C-labelled glycerol, glucose or serine. Collectively, these results reveal a bipartite metabolism of L. pneumophila, where glycerol and carbohydrates like glucose are mainly fed into anabolic processes, while serine serves as major energy supply.","['Häuslein I', 'Manske C', 'Goebel W', 'Eisenreich W', 'Hilbi H']",2016,100,2,Mol Microbiol,"Häuslein I, et al.

26687278,Inhibition of inflammasome activation by Coxiella burnetii type IV secretion system effector IcaA.,"Coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious bacterium that promotes its own replication in macrophages by inhibiting several host cell responses. Here, we show that C. burnetii inhibits caspase-1 activation in primary mouse macrophages. By using co-infection experiments, we determine that the infection of macrophages with C. burnetii inhibits the caspase-11-mediated non-canonical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induced by subsequent infection with Escherichia coli or Legionella pneumophila. Genetic screening using flagellin mutants of L. pneumophila as a surrogate host, reveals a novel C. burnetii gene (IcaA) involved in the inhibition of caspase activation. Expression of IcaA in L. pneumophila inhibited the caspase-11 activation in macrophages. Moreover, icaA(-) mutants of C. burnetii failed to suppress the caspase-11-mediated inflammasome activation induced by L. pneumophila. Our data reveal IcaA as a novel C. burnetii effector protein that is secreted by the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system and interferes with the caspase-11-induced, non-canonical activation of the inflammasome.","['Cunha LD', 'Ribeiro JM', 'Fernandes TD', 'Massis LM', 'Khoo CA', 'Moffatt JH', 'Newton HJ', 'Roy CR', 'Zamboni DS']",2015,6,,Nat Commun,"Cunha LD, et al.

26686473,Caspase-11 and caspase-1 differentially modulate actin polymerization via RhoA and Slingshot proteins to promote bacterial clearance.,"Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that include members of the NOD-like receptor family and caspase-1. Caspase-1 is required for the fusion of the Legionella vacuole with lysosomes. Caspase-11, independently of the inflammasome, also promotes phagolysosomal fusion. However, it is unclear how these proteases alter intracellular trafficking. Here, we show that caspase-11 and caspase-1 function in opposing manners to phosphorylate and dephosphorylate cofilin, respectively upon infection with Legionella. Caspase-11 targets cofilin via the RhoA GTPase, whereas caspase-1 engages the Slingshot phosphatase. The absence of either caspase-11 or caspase-1 maintains actin in the polymerized or depolymerized form, respectively and averts the fusion of pathogen-containing vacuoles with lysosomes. Therefore, caspase-11 and caspase-1 converge on the actin machinery with opposing effects to promote vesicular trafficking.","['Caution K', 'Gavrilin MA', 'Tazi M', 'Kanneganti A', 'Layman D', 'Hoque S', 'Krause K', 'Amer AO']",2015,5,,Sci Rep,"Caution K, et al.

26682961,Tigecycline resistance in clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium is mediated by an upregulation of plasmid-encoded tetracycline determinants tet(L) and tet(M).,"OBJECTIVES: Tigecycline represents one of the last-line therapeutics to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, including VRE and MRSA. The German National Reference Centre for Staphylococci and Enterococci has received 73 tigecycline-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolates in recent years. The precise mechanism of how enterococci become resistant to tigecycline remains undetermined. This study documents an analysis of the role of efflux pumps in tigecycline resistance in clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp.
METHODS: Various tigecycline MICs were found for the different isolates analysed. Tigecycline-resistant strains were analysed with respect to genome and transcriptome differences by means of WGS and RT-qPCR. Genes of interest were cloned and expressed in Listeria monocytogenes for verification of their functionality.
RESULTS: Detailed comparative whole-genome analyses of three isogenic strains, showing different levels of tigecycline resistance, revealed the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pump TetL and the ribosomal protection protein TetM as possible drug resistance proteins. Subsequent RT-qPCR confirmed up-regulation of the respective genes. A correlation of gene copy number and level of MIC was inferred from further qPCR analyses. Expression of both tet(L) and tet(M) in L. monocytogenes unequivocally demonstrated the potential to increase tigecycline MICs upon acquisition of either locus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that increased expression of two tetracycline resistance determinants, a tet(L)-encoded MFS pump and a tet(M)-encoded ribosomal protection protein, is capable of conferring tigecycline resistance in enterococcal clinical isolates.","['Fiedler S', 'Bender JK', 'Klare I', 'Halbedel S', 'Grohmann E', 'Szewzyk U', 'Werner G']",2016,71,4,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Fiedler S, et al.

26676327,The Salmonella effector SteA binds phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate for subcellular targeting within host cells.,"Many bacterial pathogens use specialized secretion systems to deliver virulence effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells. The function of these effectors depends on their localization within infected cells, but the mechanisms determining subcellular targeting of each effector are mostly elusive. Here, we show that the Salmonella type III secretion effector SteA binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P]. Ectopically expressed SteA localized at the plasma membrane (PM) of eukaryotic cells. However, SteA was displaced from the PM of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in mutants unable to synthesize the local pool of PI(4)P and from the PM of HeLa cells after localized depletion of PI(4)P. Moreover, in infected cells, bacterially translocated or ectopically expressed SteA localized at the membrane of the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) and to Salmonella-induced tubules; using the PI(4)P-binding domain of the Legionella type IV secretion effector SidC as probe, we found PI(4)P at the SCV membrane and associated tubules throughout Salmonella infection of HeLa cells. Both binding of SteA to PI(4)P and the subcellular localization of ectopically expressed or bacterially translocated SteA were dependent on a lysine residue near the N-terminus of the protein. Overall, this indicates that binding of SteA to PI(4)P is necessary for its localization within host cells.","['Domingues L', 'Ismail A', 'Charro N', 'Rodríguez-Escudero I', 'Holden DW', 'Molina M', 'Cid VJ', 'Mota LJ']",2016,18,7,Cell Microbiol,"Domingues L, et al.

26672961,Evaluation of a combined MxA and CRP point-of-care immunoassay to identify viral and/or bacterial immune response in patients with acute febrile respiratory infection.,"BACKGROUND: Challenges in the clinical differentiation of viral and/or bacterial respiratory infection lead to the misappropriation of antibiotics and increased healthcare costs. A tool to facilitate rapid and accurate point-of-care (POC) differentiation is needed.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective, single center, blinded, observational clinical trial was conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from December 2012 to August 2013 to determine the accuracy of a POC immunoassay to identify a clinically significant immune response to viral and/or bacterial infection. Sixty patients with acute febrile respiratory infection (19 pharyngitis and 41 lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]) were enrolled. Participants provided fingerstick blood for immunoassay testing (myxovirus A [MxA] and c-reactive protein [CRP]) and four oropharyngeal samples for viral PCR and routine bacterial cell culture. A venous blood sample was collected. An ELISA was used to measure CRP and MxA. Paired serological testing was used to confirm atypical bacteria. A urine sample was provided for Streptococcus and Legionella antigen testing. Patients with suspected LRTI had sputum and blood cultures, chest X-ray, and WBC count measured. Viral infection was confirmed if oropharyngeal PCR was positive for viral pathogens. Bacterial infection was confirmed in positive throat or sputum cultures. Elevated immunoglobulin M antibodies or twofold increase in IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent phase indicated atypical bacteria. Positive Streptococcus or Legionella urine antigen assays also confirmed bacterial infection. The immunoassay correctly categorized subjects as 92% (22/24) negative, 80% (16/20) with bacterial infection, and 70% (7/10) with viral infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The interplay between an MxA value and a semi-quantitative CRP value can aid in the differentiation of infectious etiology. In isolation, neither MxA nor CRP alone is sensitive or specific. However, the pattern of results in a rapid immunoassay provides a sensitive and specific method to differentiate acute febrile respiratory infections. This diagnostic information may help reduce antibiotic misuse and resistance and lower healthcare costs.","['Sambursky R', 'Shapiro N']",2015,2,,Eur Clin Respir J,Sambursky R and Shapiro N.

METHODS: FM4-64 and Hoechst were dyed that can label cell membrane and nucleus, respectively. Both dyes were used to co-stain the membranes and nucleus of eight bacterial strains ( Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia pestis, Legionella pneumonia, Vibrio cholerae and Bacillus anthracis). E. coli was dyed with different dye concentrations and times and then observed by confocal fluorescence microscopic imaging.
RESULTS: Fluorescence intensity of cell membrane and nucleus is affected by dye concentrations and times. The optimal conditions were determined as follows: staining cell membrane with 20 μg/mL FM4-64 for 1 min and cell nucleus with 20 μg/mL Hoechst for 20 min. Gram-negative bacteria were dyed better than gram-positive bacteria with FM4-64dye.

PCR is not accepted as a diagnostic tool for LD. This systematic review assesses the diagnostic accuracy of PCR in various clinical samples with a direct comparison versus UA. We included prospective or retrospective cohort and case-control studies. Studies were included if they used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consensus definition criteria of LD or a similar one, assessed only patients with clinical pneumonia, and reported data for all true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative results. Two reviewers abstracted data independently. Risk of bias was assessed using Quadas-2. Summary sensitivity and specificity values were estimated using a bivariate model and reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Thirty-eight studies were included. A total of 653 patients had confirmed LD, and 3,593 patients had pneumonia due to other pathogens. The methodological quality of the studies as assessed by the Quadas-2 tool was poor to fair. The summary sensitivity and specificity values for diagnosis of LD in respiratory samples were 97.4% (95% CI, 91.1% to 99.2%) and 98.6% (95% CI, 97.4% to 99.3%), respectively. These results were mainly unchanged by any covariates tested and subgroup analysis. The diagnostic performance of PCR in respiratory samples was much better than that of UA. Compared to UA, PCR in respiratory samples (especially in sputum samples or swabs) revealed a significant advantage in sensitivity and an additional diagnosis of 18% to 30% of LD cases. The diagnostic performance of PCR in respiratory samples was excellent and preferable to that of the UA. Results were independent on the covariate tested.

26633832,Inter-kingdom Signaling by the Legionella Quorum Sensing Molecule LAI-1 Modulates Cell Migration through an IQGAP1-Cdc42-ARHGEF9-Dependent Pathway.,"Small molecule signaling promotes the communication between bacteria as well as between bacteria and eukaryotes. The opportunistic pathogenic bacterium Legionella pneumophila employs LAI-1 (3-hydroxypentadecane-4-one) for bacterial cell-cell communication. LAI-1 is produced and detected by the Lqs (Legionella quorum sensing) system, which regulates a variety of processes including natural competence for DNA uptake and pathogen-host cell interactions. In this study, we analyze the role of LAI-1 in inter-kingdom signaling. L. pneumophila lacking the autoinducer synthase LqsA no longer impeded the migration of infected cells, and the defect was complemented by plasmid-borne lqsA. Synthetic LAI-1 dose-dependently inhibited cell migration, without affecting bacterial uptake or cytotoxicity. The forward migration index but not the velocity of LAI-1-treated cells was reduced, and the cell cytoskeleton appeared destabilized. LAI-1-dependent inhibition of cell migration involved the scaffold protein IQGAP1, the small GTPase Cdc42 as well as the Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARHGEF9, but not other modulators of Cdc42, or RhoA, Rac1 or Ran GTPase. Upon treatment with LAI-1, Cdc42 was inactivated and IQGAP1 redistributed to the cell cortex regardless of whether Cdc42 was present or not. Furthermore, LAI-1 reversed the inhibition of cell migration by L. pneumophila, suggesting that the compound and the bacteria antagonistically target host signaling pathway(s). Collectively, the results indicate that the L. pneumophila quorum sensing compound LAI-1 modulates migration of eukaryotic cells through a signaling pathway involving IQGAP1, Cdc42 and ARHGEF9.","['Simon S', 'Schell U', 'Heuer N', 'Hager D', 'Albers MF', 'Matthias J', 'Fahrnbauer F', 'Trauner D', 'Eichinger L', 'Hedberg C', 'Hilbi H']",2015,11,12,PLoS Pathog,"Simon S, et al.

26632328,Molecular diagnosis of Legionella infections--Clinical utility of front-line screening as part of a pneumonia diagnostic algorithm.,"OBJECTIVES: Urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 is the leading rapid diagnostic test for Legionnaires' Disease (LD); however other Legionella species and serogroups can also cause LD. The aim was to determine the utility of front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR in a severe respiratory infection algorithm.
METHODS: L. pneumophila and Legionella species duplex real-time PCR was carried out on 1944 specimens from hospitalised patients over a 4 year period in Edinburgh, UK.
RESULTS: L. pneumophila was detected by PCR in 49 (2.7%) specimens from 36 patients. During a LD outbreak, combined L. pneumophila respiratory PCR and urinary antigen testing had optimal sensitivity and specificity (92.6% and 98.3% respectively) for the detection of confirmed cases. Legionella species was detected by PCR in 16 (0.9%) specimens from 10 patients. The 5 confirmed and 1 probable cases of Legionella longbeachae LD were both PCR and antibody positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Front-line L. pneumophila and Legionella species PCR is a valuable addition to urinary antigen testing as part of a well-defined algorithm.

Past reports suggest that Legionella infection is frequent in cases of MERS-associated pneumonia. Obtaining an early diagnosis of legionella infection is a challenge, especially if a Legionella pneumophila serogroup other than serogroup 1 contains the causative agent.

We suggest that legionella infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of splenial lesions associated with pneumonia.","['Tomizawa Y', 'Hoshino Y', 'Sasaki F', 'Kurita N', 'Kawajiri S', 'Noda K', 'Hattori N', 'Amemura-Maekawa J', 'Kura F', 'Okuma Y']",2015,54,23,Intern Med,"Tomizawa Y, et al.

26627658,Serial crystallographic analysis of protein isomorphous replacement data from a mixture of native and derivative microcrystals.,"A post-experimental identification/purification procedure similar to that described in Zhang et al. [(2015), IUCrJ, 2, 322-326] has been proposed for use in the treatment of multiphase protein serial crystallography (SX) diffraction snapshots. As a proof of concept, the procedure was tested using theoretical serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) data from a mixture containing native and derivatized crystals of a protein. Two known proteins were taken as examples. Multiphase diffraction snapshots were subjected to two rounds of indexing using the program CrystFEL [White et al. (2012). J. Appl. Cryst. 45, 335-341]. In the first round, an ab initio indexing was performed to derive a set of approximate primitive unit-cell parameters, which are roughly the average of those from the native protein and the derivative. These parameters were then used in a second round of indexing as input to CrystFEL. The results were then used to separate the diffraction snapshots into two subsets corresponding to the native and the derivative. For each test sample, integration of the two subsets of snapshots separately led to two sets of three-dimensional diffraction intensities, one belonging to the native and the other to the derivative. Based on these two sets of intensities, a conventional single isomorphous replacement (SIR) procedure solved the structure easily.","['Zhang T', 'Yao D', 'Wang J', 'Gu Y', 'Fan H']",2015,71,Pt 12,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,"Zhang T, et al.

26627188,Water heater temperature set point and water use patterns influence Legionella pneumophila and associated microorganisms at the tap.,"BACKGROUND: Lowering water heater temperature set points and using less drinking water are common approaches to conserving water and energy; yet, there are discrepancies in past literature regarding the effects of water heater temperature and water use patterns on the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens, in particular Legionella pneumophila. Our objective was to conduct a controlled, replicated pilot-scale investigation to address this knowledge gap using continuously recirculating water heaters to examine five water heater set points (39-58 °C) under three water use conditions. We hypothesized that L. pneumophila levels at the tap depend on the collective influence of water heater temperature, flow frequency, and the resident plumbing ecology.
RESULTS: We confirmed temperature setting to be a critical factor in suppressing L. pneumophila growth both in continuously recirculating hot water lines and at distal taps. For example, at 51 °C, planktonic L. pneumophila in recirculating lines was reduced by a factor of 28.7 compared to 39 °C and was prevented from re-colonizing biofilm. However, L. pneumophila still persisted up to 58 °C, with evidence that it was growing under the conditions of this study. Further, exposure to 51 °C water in a low-use tap appeared to optimally select for L. pneumophila (e.g., 125 times greater numbers than in high-use taps). We subsequently explored relationships among L. pneumophila and other ecologically relevant microbes, noting that elevated temperature did not have a general disinfecting effect in terms of total bacterial numbers. We documented the relationship between L. pneumophila and Legionella spp., and noted several instances of correlations with Vermamoeba vermiformis, and generally found that there is a dynamic relationship with this amoeba host over the range of temperatures and water use frequencies examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a new window of understanding into the microbial ecology of potable hot water systems and helps to resolve past discrepancies in the literature regarding the influence of water temperature and stagnation on L. pneumophila, which is the cause of a growing number of outbreaks. This work is especially timely, given society's movement towards ""green"" buildings and the need to reconcile innovations in building design with public health.","['Rhoads WJ', 'Ji P', 'Pruden A', 'Edwards MA']",2015,3,,Microbiome,"Rhoads WJ, et al.

26626407,Identification of regions within the Legionella pneumophila VipA effector protein involved in actin binding and polymerization and in interference with eukaryotic organelle trafficking.,"The Legionella pneumophila effector protein VipA is an actin nucleator that co-localizes with actin filaments and early endosomes in infected macrophages and which interferes with organelle trafficking when expressed in yeast. To identify the regions of VipA involved in its subcellular localization and functions, we ectopically expressed specific VipA mutant proteins in eukaryotic cells. This indicated that the characteristic punctate distribution of VipA depends on its NH2 -terminal (amino acid residues 1-133) and central coiled-coil (amino acid residues 133-206) regions, and suggested a role for the COOH-terminal (amino acid residues 206-339) region in association with actin filaments and for the NH2 -terminal in co-localization with early endosomes. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro assays showed that the COOH-terminal region of VipA is necessary and sufficient to mediate actin binding, and is essential but insufficient to induce microfilament formation. Assays in yeast revealed that the NH2 and the COOH-terminal regions, and possibly an NPY motif within the NH2 region of VipA, are necessary for interference with organelle trafficking. Overall, this suggests that subversion of eukaryotic vesicular trafficking by VipA involves both its ability to associate with early endosomes via its NH2 -terminal region and its capacity to bind and polymerize actin through its COOH-terminal region.","['Bugalhão JN', 'Mota LJ', 'Franco IS']",2016,5,1,Microbiologyopen,"Bugalhão JN, et al.

26619220,[Identification of Systemic Contaminations with Legionella Spec. in Drinking Water Plumbing Systems: Sampling Strategies and Corresponding Parameters].,"After the amendment of the Drinking Water Ordinance in 2011, the requirements for the hygienic-microbiological monitoring of drinking water installations have increased significantly. In the BMBF-funded project ""Biofilm Management"" (2010-2014), we examined the extent to which established sampling strategies in practice can uncover drinking water plumbing systems systemically colonized with Legionella. Moreover, we investigated additional parameters that might be suitable for detecting systemic contaminations. We subjected the drinking water plumbing systems of 8 buildings with known microbial contamination (Legionella) to an intensive hygienic-microbiological sampling with high spatial and temporal resolution. A total of 626 drinking hot water samples were analyzed with classical culture-based methods. In addition, comprehensive hygienic observations were conducted in each building and qualitative interviews with operators and users were applied. Collected tap-specific parameters were quantitatively analyzed by means of sensitivity and accuracy calculations. The systemic presence of Legionella in drinking water plumbing systems has a high spatial and temporal variability. Established sampling strategies were only partially suitable to detect long-term Legionella contaminations in practice. In particular, the sampling of hot water at the calorifier and circulation re-entrance showed little significance in terms of contamination events. To detect the systemic presence of Legionella,the parameters stagnation (qualitatively assessed) and temperature (compliance with the 5K-rule) showed better results.","['Völker S', 'Schreiber C', 'Müller H', 'Zacharias N', 'Kistemann T']",2017,79,5,Gesundheitswesen,"Völker S, et al.

On the basis of the results obtained by the continuous monitoring and the changes in conditions, the original WSP, including physical treatments of water and waterlines, environmental surveillance and microbiological monitoring, was integrated introducing a UV/ultrafiltration system. The integrated treatment applied to the sulphurous water (microfiltration/UV irradiation/ultrafiltration), waterlines (superheated stream) and distal outlets (descaling/disinfection of nebulizers and nasal irrigators), ensured the removal of Legionella spp. and P. aeruginosa and a satisfactory microbiological quality over time. The environmental surveillance was successful in evaluating the hazard and identifying the most suitable preventive strategies to avoid Legionella re-growth.

In order to prevent the disease, we optimized Mip and FlaA, the virulence factors of L. pneumophila, to design recombinant Mip-FlaA dominant epitope vaccine against the pathogen. Firstly, the coding sequences of mip and flaA were optimized by DNAStar software and Expasy protein analysis system, and then, the tertiary structure and function of recombinant Mip-FlaA were predicted by PHYRE2 Protein Fold Recognition Server. After that, the optimized mip, flaA and mip-flaA were cloned, expressed and purified, and the proteins were used as dominant epitope vaccines to immunize BABL/c mice. Moreover, the IgG titers, histological changes in lung and the level of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-1β were detected to reflect the immunogenicity and protective immunity of the vaccines. The results of SDS-PAGE and Western blot proved the recombinant Mip-FlaA was successfully expressed. ELISA results of IgG titers and these cytokines showed Mip-FlaA group was capable to induce the strongest immune response, compared to PBS, Mip and FlaA groups. In addition, histopathology analysis demonstrated the mice immunized with Mip-FlaA showed better immune protection. Therefore, the work indicated that the above-described biological tools were useful in optimization of epitope vaccine. Antigenic characterization and immune protection of recombinant Mip-FlaA would be of great value in understanding the immunopathogenesis of the disease and in developing possible vaccine against the pathogen.","['He J', 'Zhang J', 'He Y', 'Huang F', 'Li J', 'Chen Q', 'Chen D', 'Chen J']",2016,64,1,Immunol Res,"He J, et al.

The outbreak consisted of 78 laboratory-confirmed cases of LD, including one fatality, with a case fatality rate of 1%. Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1, subtype Knoxville, sequence type 345, was identified as the epidemic strain. A case-control study was conducted to identify possible sources of infection. In univariable analysis, cases were almost five times more likely to smoke than controls (odds ratio (OR): 4.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.33-9.93; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, cases were twice as likely to live within a 3 km distance from one identified infection source as controls (OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.09-4.20; p < 0.027). This is the largest outbreak of LD in Germany to date. Due to a series of uncommon events, this outbreak was most likely caused by multiple sources involving industrial cooling towers.

26598709,Inhibition of host cell translation elongation by Legionella pneumophila blocks the host cell unfolded protein response.,"Cells of the innate immune system recognize bacterial pathogens by detecting common microbial patterns as well as pathogen-specific activities. One system that responds to these stimuli is the IRE1 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a sensor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Activation of IRE1, in the context of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, induces strong proinflammatory cytokine induction. We show here that Legionella pneumophila, an intravacuolar pathogen that replicates in an ER-associated compartment, blocks activation of the IRE1 pathway despite presenting pathogen products that stimulate this response. L. pneumophila TLR ligands induced the splicing of mRNA encoding XBP1s, the main target of IRE1 activity. L. pneumophila was able to inhibit both chemical and bacterial induction of XBP1 splicing via bacterial translocated proteins that interfere with host protein translation. A strain lacking five translocated translation elongation inhibitors was unable to block XBP1 splicing, but this could be rescued by expression of a single such inhibitor, consistent with limitation of the response by translation elongation inhibitors. Chemical inhibition of translation elongation blocked pattern recognition receptor-mediated XBP1 splicing, mimicking the effects of the bacterial translation inhibitors. In contrast, host cell-promoted inhibition of translation initiation in response to the pathogen was ineffective in blocking XBP1 splicing, demonstrating the need for the elongation inhibitors for protection from the UPR. The inhibition of host translation elongation may be a common strategy used by pathogens to limit the innate immune response by interfering with signaling via the UPR.","['Hempstead AD', 'Isberg RR']",2015,112,49,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Hempstead AD and Isberg RR.

26598703,Structural basis of substrate recognition by a bacterial deubiquitinase important for dynamics of phagosome ubiquitination.,"Manipulation of the host's ubiquitin network is emerging as an important strategy for counteracting and repurposing the posttranslational modification machineries of the host by pathogens. Ubiquitin E3 ligases encoded by infectious agents are well known, as are a variety of viral deubiquitinases (DUBs). Bacterial DUBs have been discovered, but little is known about the structure and mechanism underlying their ubiquitin recognition. In this report, we found that members of the Legionella pneumophila SidE effector family harbor a DUB module important for ubiquitin dynamics on the bacterial phagosome. Structural analysis of this domain alone and in complex with ubiquitin vinyl methyl ester (Ub-VME) reveals unique molecular contacts used in ubiquitin recognition. Instead of relying on the Ile44 patch of ubiquitin, as commonly used in eukaryotic counterparts, the SdeADub module engages Gln40 of ubiquitin. The architecture of the active-site cleft presents an open arrangement with conformational plasticity, permitting deubiquitination of three of the most abundant polyubiquitin chains, with a distinct preference for Lys63 linkages. We have shown that this preference enables efficient removal of Lys63 linkages from the phagosomal surface. Remarkably, the structure reveals by far the most parsimonious use of molecular contacts to achieve deubiquitination, with less than 1,000 Å(2) of accessible surface area buried upon complex formation with ubiquitin. This type of molecular recognition appears to enable dual specificity toward ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8.","['Sheedlo MJ', 'Qiu J', 'Tan Y', 'Paul LN', 'Luo ZQ', 'Das C']",2015,112,49,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Sheedlo MJ, et al.

26598366,csrT Represents a New Class of csrA-Like Regulatory Genes Associated with Integrative Conjugative Elements of Legionella pneumophila.,"UNLABELLED: Bacterial evolution is accelerated by mobile genetic elements. To spread horizontally and to benefit the recipient bacteria, genes encoded on these elements must be properly regulated. Among the legionellae are multiple integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) that each encode a paralog of the broadly conserved regulator csrA. Using bioinformatic analyses, we deduced that specific csrA paralogs are coinherited with particular lineages of the type IV secretion system that mediates horizontal spread of its ICE, suggesting a conserved regulatory interaction. As a first step to investigate the contribution of csrA regulators to this class of mobile genetic elements, we analyzed here the activity of the csrA paralog encoded on Legionella pneumophila ICE-βox. Deletion of this gene, which we name csrT, had no observed effect under laboratory conditions. However, ectopic expression of csrT abrogated the protection to hydrogen peroxide and macrophage degradation that ICE-βox confers to L. pneumophila. When ectopically expressed, csrT also repressed L. pneumophila flagellin production and motility, a function similar to the core genome's canonical csrA. Moreover, csrT restored the repression of motility to csrA mutants of Bacillus subtilis, a finding consistent with the predicted function of CsrT as an mRNA binding protein. Since all known ICEs of legionellae encode coinherited csrA-type IV secretion system pairs, we postulate that CsrA superfamily proteins regulate ICE activity to increase their horizontal spread, thereby expanding L. pneumophila versatility.
IMPORTANCE: ICEs are mobile DNA elements whose type IV secretion machineries mediate spread among bacterial populations. All surveyed ICEs within the Legionella genus also carry paralogs of the essential life cycle regulator csrA. It is striking that the csrA loci could be classified into distinct families based on either their sequence or the subtype of the adjacent type IV secretion system locus. To investigate whether ICE-encoded csrA paralogs are bona fide regulators, we analyzed ICE-βox as a model system. When expressed ectopically, its csrA paralog inhibited multiple ICE-βox phenotypes, as well as the motility of not only Legionella but also Bacillus subtilis. Accordingly, we predict that CsrA regulators equip legionellae ICEs to promote their spread via dedicated type IV secretion systems.","['Abbott ZD', 'Flynn KJ', 'Byrne BG', 'Mukherjee S', 'Kearns DB', 'Swanson MS']",2016,198,3,J Bacteriol,"Abbott ZD, et al. csrT Represents a New Class of csrA-Like Regulatory Genes Associated with Integrative Conjugative Elements of Legionella pneumophila. csrT Represents a New Class of csrA-Like Regulatory Genes Associated with Integrative Conjugative Elements of Legionella pneumophila. 2016; 198:553-64. doi: 10.1128/JB.00732-15",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26598366/

Therefore, the Microbead Quantum-dots Detection System (MQDS) was developed to identify and measure target DNAs of pathogenic microorganisms and eliminated the need of PCR amplifications. This nanomaterial-based technique can detect different microorganisms by flow cytometry measurements. In MQDS, pathogen specific DNA probes were designed to form a hairpin structure and conjugated on microbeads. In the presence of the complementary target DNA sequence, the probes will compete for binding with the reporter probes but will not interfere with the binding between the probe and internal control DNA. To monitor the binding process by flow cytometry, both the reporter probes and internal control probes were conjugated with Quantum dots that fluoresce at different emission wavelengths using the click reaction. When MQDS was used to detect the pathogens in environmental samples, a high correlation coefficient (R=0.994) for Legionella spp., with a detection limit of 0.1 ng of the extracted DNAs and 10 CFU/test, can be achieved. Thus, this newly developed technique can also be applied to detect other pathogens, particularly viruses and other genetic diseases.","['Wu TY', 'Su YY', 'Shu WH', 'Mercado AT', 'Wang SK', 'Hsu LY', 'Tsai YF', 'Chen CY']",2016,78,,Biosens Bioelectron,"Wu TY, et al.

In total, an adapted pre-absorption test was used for the serological confirmation of legionellosis in the sera of 19 children suspected of legionellosis, and also in 3 adult persons with confirmed Legionnaires' disease. Sera were pre-absorbed with antigens of L. pneumophila sg1, B. pertussis or both, and tested by ELISA tests. The reduction of IgM antibody level by pre-absorption with antigen/antigens was determined. Reduction of anti-Lpsgs1-7 IgM by pre-absorption with L.pneumophila sg1 antigen ranged from 1.5 to 80, and reduction of anti-Bp IgM by pre-absorption with B. pertussis ranged from 2.0 to 23.8. Reduction by both antigens varied depending on the age of the patients: among children <4 yrs.old, the reduction of anti-B. pertussis IgM by both antigens was higher than for B. pertussis antigen alone. Based on the high difference (≥ 2 times) between reduction by L.pneumophila sg1 and by B. pertussis antigen, legionellosis was confirmed in 8/19 children. The majority of them also indicated IgM positive/borderline results for B. pertussis or M.pneumoniae in routine ELISA tests. As a preliminary, we posed a hypothesis of a potential impact of an anti-pertussis vaccination on the results obtained in anti-L. pneumophila ELISA IgM tests among young children.",['Pancer KW'],2015,40,2,Cent Eur J Immunol,Pancer KW.

26545400,Life Stage-specific Proteomes of Legionella pneumophila Reveal a Highly Differential Abundance of Virulence-associated Dot/Icm effectors.,"Major differences in the transcriptional program underlying the phenotypic switch between exponential and post-exponential growth of Legionella pneumophila were formerly described characterizing important alterations in infection capacity. Additionally, a third state is known where the bacteria transform in a viable but nonculturable state under stress, such as starvation. We here describe phase-related proteomic changes in exponential phase (E), postexponential phase (PE) bacteria, and unculturable microcosms (UNC) containing viable but nonculturable state cells, and identify phase-specific proteins. We present data on different bacterial subproteomes of E and PE, such as soluble whole cell proteins, outer membrane-associated proteins, and extracellular proteins. In total, 1368 different proteins were identified, 922 were quantified and 397 showed differential abundance in E/PE. The quantified subproteomes of soluble whole cell proteins, outer membrane-associated proteins, and extracellular proteins; 841, 55, and 77 proteins, respectively, were visualized in Voronoi treemaps. 95 proteins were quantified exclusively in E, such as cell division proteins MreC, FtsN, FtsA, and ZipA; 33 exclusively in PE, such as motility-related proteins of flagellum biogenesis FlgE, FlgK, and FliA; and 9 exclusively in unculturable microcosms soluble whole cell proteins, such as hypothetical, as well as transport/binding-, and metabolism-related proteins. A high frequency of differentially abundant or phase-exclusive proteins was observed among the 91 quantified effectors of the major virulence-associated protein secretion system Dot/Icm (> 60%). 24 were E-exclusive, such as LepA/B, YlfA, MavG, Lpg2271, and 13 were PE-exclusive, such as RalF, VipD, Lem10. The growth phase-related specific abundance of a subset of Dot/Icm virulence effectors was confirmed by means of Western blotting. We therefore conclude that many effectors are predominantly abundant at either E or PE which suggests their phase specific function. The distinct temporal or spatial presence of such proteins might have important implications for functional assignments in the future or for use as life-stage specific markers for pathogen analysis.","['Aurass P', 'Gerlach T', 'Becher D', 'Voigt B', 'Karste S', 'Bernhardt J', 'Riedel K', 'Hecker M', 'Flieger A']",2016,15,1,Mol Cell Proteomics,"Aurass P, et al.

26543151,Compost and Legionella longbeachae: an emerging infection?,"Human disease caused by Legionella species is dominated by Legionella pneumophila, the main causative agent in cases of Legionnaires' disease. However, other species are known to cause infection, for example, Legionella longbeachae causes an equivalent number of cases of disease as L. pneumophila in Australia and New Zealand. Infection with L. longbeachae is commonly associated with exposure to composts and potting soils, and cases of infection with this organism have been increasing in Europe over the past ten years. The increase in incidence may be linked to factors such as increased awareness of clinical presentation, or due to changing formulation of growing media, although it should be noted that the presence of Legionella species in growing media does not correlate with the number of cases currently seen. This is likely due to the variables associated with infection, for example, host factors such as smoking or underlying health conditions, or difference in growing media storage or climate, especially warm humid conditions, which may affect survival and growth of these organisms in the growing media environment. There are numerous unknowns in this area and collaboration between growing media manufacturers and researchers, as well as more awareness among diagnosing clinicians, laboratory staff and the general public is necessary to reduce risk. More research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn: L. pneumophila research currently dominates the field and it is likely that the overreliance on diagnostic techniques such as the urinary antigen test, which is specific for L. pneumophila Sg 1, is detrimental to the diagnosis of L. longbeachae infection.","['Currie SL', 'Beattie TK']",2015,135,6,Perspect Public Health,Currie SL and Beattie TK.

26538361,"The α-hydroxyketone LAI-1 regulates motility, Lqs-dependent phosphorylation signalling and gene expression of Legionella pneumophila.","The causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, Legionella pneumophila, employs the autoinducer compound LAI-1 (3-hydroxypentadecane-4-one) for cell-cell communication. LAI-1 is produced and detected by the Lqs (Legionella quorum sensing) system, comprising the autoinducer synthase LqsA, the sensor kinases LqsS and LqsT, as well as the response regulator LqsR. Lqs-regulated processes include pathogen-host interactions, production of extracellular filaments and natural competence for DNA uptake. Here we show that synthetic LAI-1 promotes the motility of L. pneumophila by signalling through LqsS/LqsT and LqsR. Upon addition of LAI-1, autophosphorylation of LqsS/LqsT by [γ-(32) P]-ATP was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the Vibrio cholerae autoinducer CAI-1 (3-hydroxytridecane-4-one) promoted the phosphorylation of LqsS (but not LqsT). LAI-1 did neither affect the stability of phospho-LqsS or phospho-LqsT, nor the dephosphorylation by LqsR. Transcriptome analysis of L. pneumophila treated with LAI-1 revealed that the compound positively regulates a number of genes, including the non-coding RNAs rsmY and rsmZ, and negatively regulates the RNA-binding global regulator crsA. Accordingly, LAI-1 controls the switch from the replicative to the transmissive growth phase of L. pneumophila. In summary, the findings indicate that LAI-1 regulates motility and the biphasic life style of L. pneumophila through LqsS- and LqsT-dependent phosphorylation signalling.","['Schell U', 'Simon S', 'Sahr T', 'Hager D', 'Albers MF', 'Kessler A', 'Fahrnbauer F', 'Trauner D', 'Hedberg C', 'Buchrieser C', 'Hilbi H']",2016,99,4,Mol Microbiol,"Schell U, et al.

In many species, including the Gram-positive human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, c-di-AMP is essential for growth. Here we show that the single diadenylate cyclase of L. monocytogenes, CdaA, is an integral membrane protein that interacts with its potential regulatory protein, CdaR, via the transmembrane protein domain. The presence of the CdaR protein is not required for the membrane localization and abundance of CdaA. We have also found that CdaR negatively influences CdaA activity in L. monocytogenes and that the role of CdaR is most evident at a high growth temperature. Interestingly, a cdaR mutant strain is less susceptible to lysozyme. Moreover, CdaA contributes to cell division, and cells depleted of CdaA are prone to lysis. The observation that the growth defect of a CdaA depletion strain can be partially restored by increasing the osmolarity of the growth medium suggests that c-di-AMP is important for maintaining the integrity of the protective cell envelope. Overall, this work provides new insights into the relationship between CdaA and CdaR.

26526572,Natural transformation occurs independently of the essential actin-like MreB cytoskeleton in Legionella pneumophila.,"Natural transformation is the process by which bacteria can actively take up and integrate exogenous DNA thereby providing a source of genetic diversity. Under specific growth conditions the coordinated expression of several genes--a situation referred to as ""competence""--allows bacteria to assemble a highly processive and dedicated system that can import high molecular weight DNA. Within the cell these large imported DNA molecules are protected from degradation and brought to the chromosome for recombination. Here, we report elevated expression of mreB during competence in the Gram-negative pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Interestingly a similar observation had previously been reported in the distantly-related Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis. MreB is often viewed as the bacterial actin homolog contributing to bacterial morphogenesis by coordinating peptidoglycan-synthesising complexes. In addition MreB is increasingly found to be involved in a growing number of processes including chromosome segregation and motor-driven motility. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we examined the possible role of MreB during natural transformation in L. pneumophila. Our data show that natural transformation does not require MreB dynamics and exclude a direct role of MreB filaments in the transport of foreign DNA and its recombination in the chromosome.","['Juan PA', 'Attaiech L', 'Charpentier X']",2015,5,,Sci Rep,"Juan PA, et al.

Disease incidence was higher among blacks than whites and was 10 times higher in New York than California. Laboratory data indicated a reliance on urinary antigen testing, which only detects Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1).

26501115,Hidden Selection of Bacterial Resistance to Fluoroquinolones In Vivo: The Case of Legionella pneumophila and Humans.,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases are the leading cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. One dramatic issue is the emergence of microbial resistance to antibiotics which is a major public health concern. Surprisingly however, such in vivo adaptive ability has not been reported yet for many intracellular human bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila.
METHODS: We examined 82 unrelated patients with Legionnaire's disease from which 139 respiratory specimens were sampled during hospitalization and antibiotic therapy. We both developed a real time PCR assay and used deep-sequencing approaches to detect antibiotic resistance mutations in L. pneumophila and follow their selection and fate in these samples.
FINDINGS: We identified the in vivo selection of fluoroquinolone resistance mutations in L. pneumophila in two infected patients treated with these antibiotics. By investigating the mutational dynamics in patients, we showed that antibiotic resistance occurred during hospitalization most likely after fluoroquinolone treatment.
INTERPRETATION: In vivo selection of antibiotic resistances in L. pneumophila may be associated with treatment failures and poor prognosis. This hidden resistance must be carefully considered in the therapeutic management of legionellosis patients and in the control of the gradual loss of effectiveness of antibiotics.","['Shadoud L', 'Almahmoud I', 'Jarraud S', 'Etienne J', 'Larrat S', 'Schwebel C', 'Timsit JF', 'Schneider D', 'Maurin M']",2015,2,9,EBioMedicine,"Shadoud L, et al.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine clinical and radiographic characteristics of pulmonary infection due to Legionella in persons undergoing treatment for cancer and stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients.
METHODS: Retrospective review of Legionella cases at MSKCC over a fifteen-year study period from January 1999 and December 2013. Cases were identified by review of microbiology records.
RESULTS: During the study period, 40 cases of Legionella infection were identified; nine among these were due to non-pneumophila species. Most cases occurred during the summer. The majority [8/9, (89%)] of patients with non-pneumophila infection had underlying hematologic malignancy, compared to 18/31 (58%) with Legionella pneumophila infections. Radiographic findings were varied-nodular infiltrates mimicking invasive fungal infection were seen only among patients with hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients and were frequently associated with non-pneumophila infections (50% vs 16%; P = 0.0594). All cases of nodular Legionella pneumonia were found incidentally or had an indolent clinical course.

26495985,"Impact of Water Chemistry, Pipe Material and Stagnation on the Building Plumbing Microbiome.","A unique microbiome establishes in the portion of the potable water distribution system within homes and other buildings (i.e., building plumbing). To examine its composition and the factors that shape it, standardized cold water plumbing rigs were deployed at the treatment plant and in the distribution system of five water utilities across the U.S. Three pipe materials (copper with lead solder, CPVC with brass fittings or copper/lead combined pipe) were compared, with 8 hour flush cycles of 10 minutes to simulate typical daily use patterns. High throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was employed to profile and compare the resident bulk water bacteria and archaea. The utility, location of the pipe rig, pipe material and stagnation all had a significant influence on the plumbing microbiome composition, but the utility source water and treatment practices were dominant factors. Examination of 21 water chemistry parameters suggested that the total chlorine concentration, pH, P, SO42- and Mg were associated with the most of the variation in bulk water microbiome composition. Disinfectant type exerted a notably low-magnitude impact on microbiome composition. At two utilities using the same source water, slight differences in treatment approaches were associated with differences in rare taxa in samples. For genera containing opportunistic pathogens, Utility C samples (highest pH of 9-10) had the highest frequency of detection for Legionella spp. and lowest relative abundance of Mycobacterium spp. Data were examined across utilities to identify a true universal core, special core, and peripheral organisms to deepen insight into the physical and chemical factors that shape the building plumbing microbiome.","['Ji P', 'Parks J', 'Edwards MA', 'Pruden A']",2015,10,10,PLoS One,"Ji P, et al.

26495854,Yersinia pestis Requires Host Rab1b for Survival in Macrophages.,"Yersinia pestis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes the disease known as plague. During infection of macrophages Y. pestis actively evades the normal phagosomal maturation pathway to establish a replicative niche within the cell. However, the mechanisms used by Y. pestis to subvert killing by the macrophage are unknown. Host Rab GTPases are central mediators of vesicular trafficking and are commonly targeted by bacterial pathogens to alter phagosome maturation and killing by macrophages. Here we demonstrate for the first time that host Rab1b is required for Y. pestis to effectively evade killing by macrophages. We also show that Rab1b is specifically recruited to the Yersinia containing vacuole (YCV) and that Y. pestis is unable to subvert YCV acidification when Rab1b expression is knocked down in macrophages. Furthermore, Rab1b knockdown also altered the frequency of association between the YCV with the lysosomal marker Lamp1, suggesting that Rab1b recruitment to the YCV directly inhibits phagosome maturation. Finally, we show that Rab1b knockdown also impacts the pH of the Legionella pneumophila containing vacuole, another pathogen that recruits Rab1b to its vacuole. Together these data identify a novel role for Rab1b in the subversion of phagosome maturation by intracellular pathogens and suggest that recruitment of Rab1b to the pathogen containing vacuole may be a conserved mechanism to control vacuole pH.","['Connor MG', 'Pulsifer AR', 'Price CT', 'Abu Kwaik Y', 'Lawrenz MB']",2015,11,10,PLoS Pathog,"Connor MG, et al.

Using the conventional culture method, Legionella pneumophila was detected in 11 samples (11/68, 16.2%). Contrary to our expectation, the culture method with the amoebic co-culture technique did not increase the detection rate of Legionella (4/68, 5.9%). In contrast, a combination of the amoebic co-culture technique followed by qPCR successfully increased the detection rate (57/68, 83.8%) compared with real-time qPCR alone (46/68, 67.6%). Using real-time qPCR after culture with amoebic co-culture, more than 10-fold higher bacterial numbers were observed in 30 samples (30/68, 44.1%) compared with the same samples without co-culture. On the other hand, higher bacterial numbers were not observed after propagation by amoebae in 32 samples (32/68, 47.1%). Legionella was not detected in the remaining six samples (6/68, 8.8%), irrespective of the method. These results suggest that application of the amoebic co-culture technique prior to real-time qPCR may be useful for the sensitive detection of Legionella from bath water samples. Furthermore, a combination of amoebic co-culture and real-time qPCR might be useful to detect viable and virulent Legionella because their ability to invade and multiply within free-living amoebae is considered to correlate with their pathogenicity for humans.

Of six probes tested, Tb(R332H) (a mutant of the Tubby protein pleckstrin homology domain) was judged the best reporter for phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2], and the P4M domain from Legionella SidM for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P). Using accurately calibrated illumination, we found that only ∼50% of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and very little PtdIns4P were depleted by full daylight intensities in wild-type flies, but both were severely depleted by ∼100-fold dimmer intensities in mutants lacking Ca(2+)-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) channels or protein kinase C (PKC). Resynthesis of PtdIns4P (t½ ∼12 s) was faster than PtdIns(4,5)P2 (t½ ∼40 s), but both were greatly slowed in mutants of DAG kinase (rdgA) or PtdIns transfer protein (rdgB). The results indicate that Ca(2+)- and PKC-dependent inhibition of PLC is required for enabling photoreceptors to maintain phosphoinositide levels despite high rates of hydrolysis by PLC, and suggest that phosphorylation of PtdIns4P to PtdIns(4,5)P2 is the rate-limiting step of the cycle.","['Hardie RC', 'Liu CH', 'Randall AS', 'Sengupta S']",2015,128,23,J Cell Sci,"Hardie RC, et al.

26481275,Modelling characteristics to predict Legionella contamination risk - Surveillance of drinking water plumbing systems and identification of risk areas.,"For the surveillance of drinking water plumbing systems (DWPS) and the identification of risk factors, there is a need for an early estimation of the risk of Legionella contamination within a building, using efficient and assessable parameters to estimate hazards and to prioritize risks. The precision, accuracy and effectiveness of ways of estimating the risk of higher Legionella numbers (temperature, stagnation, pipe materials, etc.) have only rarely been empirically assessed in practice, although there is a broad consensus about the impact of these risk factors. We collected n = 807 drinking water samples from 9 buildings which had had Legionella spp. occurrences of >100 CFU/100mL within the last 12 months, and tested for Legionella spp., L. pneumophila, HPC 20°C and 36°C (culture-based). Each building was sampled for 6 months under standard operating conditions in the DWPS. We discovered high variability (up to 4 log(10) steps) in the presence of Legionella spp. (CFU/100 mL) within all buildings over a half year period as well as over the course of a day. Occurrences were significantly correlated with temperature, pipe length measures, and stagnation. Logistic regression modelling revealed three parameters (temperature after flushing until no significant changes in temperatures can be obtained, stagnation (low withdrawal, qualitatively assessed), pipe length proportion) to be the best predictors of Legionella contamination (>100 CFU/100 mL) at single outlets (precision = 66.7%; accuracy = 72.1%; F(0.5) score = 0.59).","['Völker S', 'Schreiber C', 'Kistemann T']",2016,219,1,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Völker S, et al.

26473896,Prevalence and Molecular Characteristics of Waterborne Pathogen Legionella in Industrial Cooling Tower Environments.,"Cooling towers are a source of Legionnaires' disease. It is important from a public health perspective to survey industrial cooling towers for the presence of Legionella. Prospective surveillance of the extent of Legionella pollution was conducted at factories in Shijiazhuang, China between March 2011 and September 2012. Overall, 35.7% of 255 industrial cooling tower water samples showed Legionella-positive, and their concentrations ranged from 100 Colony-Forming Units (CFU)/liter to 88,000 CFU/liter, with an average concentration of 9100 CFU/liter. A total of 121 isolates were obtained. All isolates were L. pneumophila, and the isolated serogroups included serogroups 1 (68 isolates, 56.2%), 6 (25, 20.7%), 5 (12, 9.9%), 8 (8, 6.6%), 3 (6, 5.0%) and 9 (2, 1.6%). All 121 isolates were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and 64 different patterns were obtained. All 121 isolates were analyzed sequence-based typing (SBT), a full 7-allele profile was obtained from 117 isolates. One hundred and seventeen isolates were divided into 49 sequence types. Two virulence genes, lvh and rtxA, are analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 92.6% (112/121) and 98.3% (119/121) isolates carried lvh and rtxA respectively and 90.9% (110/121) of tested isolates carried both genes. Our results demonstrated high prevalence and genetic polymorphism of L. pneumophila in industrial cooling tower environments in Shijiazhang, China, and the SBT and virulence gene PCR results suggested that the isolates were pathogenic. Improved control and prevention strategies are urgently needed.","['Li L', 'Qin T', 'Li Y', 'Zhou H', 'Song H', 'Ren H', 'Li L', 'Li Y', 'Zhao D']",2015,12,10,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Li L, et al.

26468663,Vaccine potential of bacterial macrophage infectivity potentiator (MIP)-like peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) proteins.,"Peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) are a superfamily of proteins ubiquitously distributed among living organisms, which function primarily to assist the folding and structuring of unfolded and partially folded polypeptide chains and proteins. In this review, we focus specifically on the Macrophage Infectivity Potentiator (MIP)-like PPIases, which are members of the immunophilin family of FK506-binding proteins (FKBP). MIP-like PPIases have accessory roles in virulence and are candidates for inclusion in vaccines protective against both animal and human bacterial pathogens. A structural vaccinology approach obviates any issues over molecular mimicry and potential cross-reactivity with human FKBP proteins and studies with a representative antigen, the Neisseria meningitidis-MIP, support this strategy. Moreover, a dual approach of vaccination and drug targeting could be considered for controlling bacterial infectious diseases of humans and animals.","['Humbert MV', 'Almonacid Mendoza HL', 'Jackson AC', 'Hung MC', 'Bielecka MK', 'Heckels JE', 'Christodoulides M']",2015,14,12,Expert Rev Vaccines,"Humbert MV, et al.

26464771,"Etiological Diagnosis of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adult Patients: A Prospective Hospital-Based Study in Mashhad, Iran.","BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the third most common cause of death in the world, and mortality is highest for patients who require hospitalization.
OBJECTIVES: This prospective observational study is an etiological survey of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) over a 12-month period in the Iranian city of Mashhad. To our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective hospital-based studies to comprehensively evaluate the epidemiological, demographical, clinical, and prognostic factors of patients with CAP in Iran.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied all adult patients (aged ≥ 16 years) with CAP admitted to Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, between February 2013 and January 2014. The etiological diagnosis of CAP was made through conventional culturing and staining of respiratory secretions (i.e. sputum and pleural fluid), standard BACTEC™ Plus Aerobic/F bottles for blood cultures, and the immunochromatographic assays BinaxNOW(®) Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen and BinaxNOW(®) Legionella pneumophila antigen for the detection of S. pneumoniae antigen and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen, respectively.
RESULTS: Among 120 patients with CAP, the most common etiology was S. pneumoniae (24.4%), followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (17.5%), S. aureus (6.7%), polymicrobial agents including anaerobes (4.2%), complicated hydatid cyst (2.5%), Influenza A virus (4.2%; including 2 cases of mixed Influenza A-bacterial infection), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Brucella melitensis, Mucor, and varicella, each in 0.8% of the patients. The diagnosis of pneumonia remained unknown in 49 (40%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis was an important cause of CAP in our region. Hence, it should be considered in all patients admitted with a CAP diagnosis.","['Naderi H', 'Sheybani F', 'Sarvghad M', 'Meshkat Z', 'Jabbari Nooghabi M']",2015,8,8,Jundishapur J Microbiol,"Naderi H, et al.

26462745,Hospital-wide Eradication of a Nosocomial Legionella pneumophila Serogroup 1 Outbreak.,"BACKGROUND: Two proven nosocomial cases of Legionella pneumonia occurred at the Wesley Hospital (Brisbane, Australia) in May 2013. To trace the epidemiology of these cases, whole genome sequence analysis was performed on Legionella pneumophila isolates from the infected patients, prospective isolates collected from the hospital water distribution system (WDS), and retrospective patient isolates available from the Wesley Hospital and other local hospitals.
METHODS: Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates were cultured from patient sputum (n = 3), endobronchial washings (n = 3), pleural fluid (n = 1), and the Wesley Hospital WDS (n = 39). Whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly allowed comparison with the L. pneumophila Paris reference strain to infer phylogenetic and epidemiological relationships. Rapid disinfection of the hospital WDS with a chlorinated, alkaline detergent and subsequent superchlorination followed by maintenance of residual free chlorine, combined with removal of redundant plumbing, was instituted.
RESULTS: The 2011 and 2013 L. pneumophila patient isolates were serogroup 1 and closely related to all 2013 hospital water isolates based on single nucleotide polymorphisms and mobile genetic element profiles, suggesting a single L. pneumophila population as the source of nosocomial infection. The L. pneumophila population has evolved to comprise 3 clonal variants, each associated with different parts of the hospital WDS.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an exemplar for the use of clinical and genomic epidemiological methods together with a program of rapid, effective remedial biofilm, plumbing and water treatment to characterize and eliminate a L. pneumophila population responsible for nosocomial infections.","['Bartley PB', 'Ben Zakour NL', 'Stanton-Cook M', 'Muguli R', 'Prado L', 'Garnys V', 'Taylor K', 'Barnett TC', 'Pinna G', 'Robson J', 'Paterson DL', 'Walker MJ', 'Schembri MA', 'Beatson SA']",2016,62,3,Clin Infect Dis,"Bartley PB, et al.

Osbeck, Juniperus phoenicea L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Ruta graveolens L., and Thymus vulgaris L., and to evaluate their activity against Legionella pneumophila (microdilution assays). Eight Legionella pneumophila strains were studied, including the two well-known serogroup 1 Lens and Paris strains as controls and six environmental strains isolated from Tunisian spas belonging to serogroups 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8. The essential oils were generally active against L. pneumophila. The activities of the A. herba-alba, C. sinensis, and R. officinalis essential oils were strain-dependent, whereas those of the J. phoenicea and T. vulgaris oils, showing the highest anti-Legionella activities, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) lower than 0.03 and lower than or equal to 0.07 mg/ml, respectively, were independent of the strains' serogroup. Moreover, the microorganisms treated with T. vulgaris essential oil were shorter, swollen, and less electron-dense compared to the untreated controls. Isoborneol (20.91%), (1S)-α-pinene (18.30%) β-phellandrene (8.08%), α-campholenal (7.91%), and α-phellandrene (7.58%) were the major components isolated from the J. phoenicea oil, while carvacrol (88.50%) was the main compound of the T. vulgaris oil, followed by p-cymene (7.86%).

In this work, we present the development and application of a drug discovery protocol by targeting this enzyme in Legionella pneumophila, the major causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. We employ a combination of high-throughput screening to identify small-molecule binders, enzymatic activity measurements to identify inhibitors in vitro, and the verification of the inhibitory effect in vivo. The most potent inhibitor shows an IC50 value in the low micromolar range and successfully abolishes the synthesis of pyomelanin in L. pneumophila cultures at 10 μM. Thus, this compound represents a novel and effective tool for investigating the role of pyomelanin in the biology and pathogenicity of this organism. Altogether, the results demonstrate a successful pathway for drug development focusing on binding specificity in the initial high-throughput screening steps.","['Aubi O', 'Flydal MI', 'Zheng H', 'Skjærven L', 'Rekand I', 'Leiros HK', 'Haug BE', 'Cianciotto NP', 'Martinez A', 'Underhaug J']",2015,58,21,J Med Chem,"Aubi O, et al.

Waterborne microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) and phytoplankton, are detected by interrogating the volume sample either in a fluorescent or label-free mode, i.e. with or without fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules attached to the micro-organisms, respectively. We achieve a sensitivity of 50 cells per ml, which can be further increased to 0.2 cells per ml by pre-concentrating an initial sample volume of 500 ml with an ad hoc fluidic system.

Legionella micdadei is a Gram negative bacterium that can stain weakly acid fast. It was first described in 1979 after immunosuppressed patients developed pneumonia at a Pittsburgh VA, initially given the name Pittsburgh Pneumonia Agent. It is the second most common Legionella species causing infection after pneumophila, and typically infects immunocompromised hosts. It is not easy to be cultured which makes diagnosing difficult. Case Presentation. A 31-year-old female with ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and cirrhosis presented with fever, chills, shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain for five days after being started on immunosuppression for autoimmune hepatitis two months earlier. The first chest CT showed small bilateral cavitary nodules. The nodules continued to grow on subsequent imaging despite what was thought to be appropriate therapy. A transthoracic biopsy was performed which grew Legionella micdadei and the patient improved after being treated with levofloxacin. Conclusion. Legionella micdadei is an atypical pathogen known to cause pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients. This case highlights a typical presentation of an atypical infection not commonly thought about and should be considered when nodules are growing despite being on broad antimicrobial therapy.","['Lachant D', 'Prasad P']",2015,2015,,Case Rep Pulmonol,Lachant D and Prasad P.

26441958,Subversion of Cell-Autonomous Immunity and Cell Migration by Legionella pneumophila Effectors.,"Bacteria trigger host defense and inflammatory processes, such as cytokine production, pyroptosis, and the chemotactic migration of immune cells toward the source of infection. However, a number of pathogens interfere with these immune functions by producing specific so-called ""effector"" proteins, which are delivered to host cells via dedicated secretion systems. Air-borne Legionella pneumophila bacteria trigger an acute and potential fatal inflammation in the lung termed Legionnaires' disease. The opportunistic pathogen L. pneumophila is a natural parasite of free-living amoebae, but also replicates in alveolar macrophages and accidentally infects humans. The bacteria employ the intracellular multiplication/defective for organelle trafficking (Icm/Dot) type IV secretion system and as many as 300 different effector proteins to govern host-cell interactions and establish in phagocytes an intracellular replication niche, the Legionella-containing vacuole. Some Icm/Dot-translocated effector proteins target cell-autonomous immunity or cell migration, i.e., they interfere with (i) endocytic, secretory, or retrograde vesicle trafficking pathways, (ii) organelle or cell motility, (iii) the inflammasome and programed cell death, or (iv) the transcription factor NF-κB.

OBJECTIVE: Determine predictors of mortality or ICU admission.
METHODS: Retrospective follow-up of patients diagnosed with Legionella pneumophila pneumonia in Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de A Coruña. Period 2000-2013 (n=240). Analysis of multivariate logistic regression was performed.
RESULTS: Mean age was 57.2±15.4 years old, 88.3% were male. Average score of comorbidity (Charlson score) was 2.3±2.3. There was a clear seasonal variation. Predominant symptoms were fever (92.5%), dry cough (38.1%) and dyspnea (33.9%). Creatinine clearance was lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² in 29.7% and sodium<135 mEq/l in 58.3%. Admission to ICU rate was 16.3% and 10.8% needs mechanical ventilation. Inhospital mortality rate was 4.6%, rising to 23.1% in patients admitted to ICU. Variables associated to predict ICU admission were age (OR=0.96), liver disease (OR=7.13), dyspnea (OR=4.33), delirium (OR=5.86) and high levels of lactatedehydrogenase (OR=1.002). Variables associated with inhospital mortality were Charlson index (OR=1.70), mechanical ventilation (OR=31.44) and high levels of lactatedehydrogenase (OR=1.002).
DISCUSSION: Younger patients with liver disease, dyspnea and confusion are more likely to be admitted to ICU.

The goal of the outbreak investigation was to rapidly identify and eliminate the contamination source in order to prevent new cases.
METHODS: A case-case study design was applied comprising reported cases of S. Bovismorbificans and cases of other serovars. A trawling questionnaire was administered by telephone interview. Data were collected for 34 cases (20 S. Bovismorbificans and 14 Salmonella spp.) pertaining to food consumption during the 72 hours prior to symptom onset.
RESULTS: A statistically significant association between an S. Bovismorbificans infection and the consumption of 'salads' (odds ratio [OR] 14.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47-138.27) as well as the consumption of 'sprouts' (OR 10.6, 95% CI 1.16-97.59) was found. Principal places of consumption of 'salads' and 'sprouts' in outbreak cases were restaurants in southern Germany (80.0%, 95% CI 56.3%-94.3%). Microbiological analysis in Germany identified S. Bovismorbificans on sprouts, and genotype analysis confirmed that Swiss and German cases shared the same outbreak strain. The contaminated products were removed from the market in Germany, preventing an on-going outbreak.
CONCLUSION: The combination of the applied methods and the collaboration between the two countries proved to be crucial elements of this investigation.

However, Lem10 lacks the catalytic His-Asp residue pair and does not show any in vitro phosphohydrolase enzymatic activity, typical for HD proteins. While the biological function of Lem10 remains elusive, our analysis shows that similar distinct features are shared by a significant number of HD domains found in Legionella proteins, including the SidE family of effectors known to play an important role during infection. Taken together our data point to the presence of a specific group of non-catalytic Legionella HD domains, dubbed LHDs, which are involved in pathogenesis.","['Morar M', 'Evdokimova E', 'Chang C', 'Ensminger AW', 'Savchenko A']",2015,83,12,Proteins,"Morar M, et al.

26425041,Role of Atypical Pathogens and the Antibiotic Prescription Pattern in Acute Bronchitis: A Multicenter Study in Korea.,"The role of atypical bacteria and the effect of antibiotic treatments in acute bronchitis are still not clear. This study was conducted at 22 hospitals (17 primary care clinics and 5 university hospitals) in Korea. Outpatients (aged ≥ 18 yr) who had an acute illness with a new cough and sputum (≤ 30 days) were enrolled in 2013. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect five atypical bacteria. A total of 435 patients were diagnosed as having acute bronchitis (vs. probable pneumonia, n = 75), and 1.8% (n = 8) were positive for atypical pathogens (Bordetella pertussis, n = 3; B. parapertussis, n = 0; Mycoplasma pneumoniae, n = 1; Chlamydophila pneumoniae, n = 3; Legionella pneumophila, n = 1). Among clinical symptoms and signs, only post-tussive vomiting was more frequent in patients with atypical pathogens than those without (P = 0.024). In all, 72.2% of the enrolled patients received antibiotic treatment at their first visits, and β-lactams (29.4%) and quinolones (20.5%) were the most commonly prescribed agents. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the incidence of atypical pathogens is low in patients with acute bronchitis, and the rate of antibiotic prescriptions is high.","['Park S', 'Oh KC', 'Kim KS', 'Song KT', 'Yoo KH', 'Shim YS', 'Lee YJ', 'Lee MG', 'Yun JU', 'Kim HS', 'Kim YH', 'Lee WJ', 'Kim DI', 'Cha HG', 'Lee JM', 'Seo JS', 'Jung KS']",2015,30,10,J Korean Med Sci,"Park S, et al.

Rapid diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease allows the use of therapy specific for the disease. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 is the most common cause of infection acquired in community and hospital environments. The non-L. pneumophila infections are likely under-detected because of a lack of effective diagnosis. In this work, simplex and duplex PCR assays with the use of new molecular markers pcs and pmtA involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis were specified for rapid and cost-efficient identification and distinguishing Legionella species. The sets of primers developed were found to be sensitive and specific for reliable detection of Legionella belonging to the eight most clinically relevant species. Among these, four primer sets I, II, VI, and VII used for duplex-PCRs proved to have the highest identification power and reliability in the detection of the bacteria.

26419332,The structure of Legionella pneumophila LegK4 type four secretion system (T4SS) effector reveals a novel dimeric eukaryotic-like kinase.,"Bacterial pathogens subvert signalling pathways to promote invasion and/or replication into the host. LegK1-4 proteins are eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases that are translocated by the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) of several Legionella pneumophila strains. We present the crystal structures of an active fragment of the LegK4 protein in apo and substrate-bound states. The structure of LegK4(1-445) reveals a eukaryotic-like kinase domain flanked by a novel cap domain and a four-helix bundle. The protein self-assembles through interactions mediated by helices αF and αG that generate a dimeric interface not previously observed in a protein kinase. The helix αG is displaced compared to previous kinase structures, and its role in stabilization of the activation loop is taken on by the dimerisation interface. The apo-form of the protein has an open conformation with a disordered P-loop but a structured activation segment in absence of targeted phosphorylation. The nucleotide-binding site of LegK4 contains an unusual set of residues that mediate non-canonical interactions with AMP-PNP. Nucleotide binding results in limited changes in the active site, suggesting that LegK4 constitutive kinase activity does not depend on phosphorylation of the activation loop but on the stabilizing effects of the dimer.","['Flayhan A', 'Bergé C', 'Baïlo N', 'Doublet P', 'Bayliss R', 'Terradot L']",2015,5,,Sci Rep,"Flayhan A, et al.

The surface O-antigen gene clusters of L. pneumophila serogroups O4, O6, O7, O10 and O13 were sequenced and analyzed, with the function annotated on the basis of homology to that of the genes of L. pneumophila serogroup O1 (L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str.

The gene locus of the six L. pneumophila serogroups contains genes of yvfE, neuABCD, pseA-like for nucleotide sugar biosynthesis, wecA for sugar transfer, and wzm as well as wzt for O-antigen processing. The detection of O-antigen genes allows the fine differentiation at species and serogroup level without the neccessity of nucleotide sequencing.

Mechanical circulatory support has proved to be a safe and effective bridge to myocardial recovery in patients with acute fulminant myocarditis; however, to our knowledge, this support has not been used in infectious myocarditis specifically related to Legionellosis.

26399998,Hybrid de novo tandem repeat detection using short and long reads.,"BACKGROUND: As one of the most studied genome rearrangements, tandem repeats have a considerable impact on genetic backgrounds of inherited diseases. Many methods designed for tandem repeat detection on reference sequences obtain high quality results. However, in the case of a de novo context, where no reference sequence is available, tandem repeat detection remains a difficult problem. The short reads obtained with the second-generation sequencing methods are not long enough to span regions that contain long repeats. This length limitation was tackled by the long reads obtained with the third-generation sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences technologies. Nevertheless, the gain on the read length came with a significant increase of the error rate. The main objective of nowadays studies on long reads is to handle the high error rate up to 16%.
METHODS: In this paper we present MixTaR, the first de novo method for tandem repeat detection that combines the high-quality of short reads and the large length of long reads. Our hybrid algorithm uses the set of short reads for tandem repeat pattern detection based on a de Bruijn graph. These patterns are then validated using the long reads, and the tandem repeat sequences are constructed using local greedy assemblies.
RESULTS: MixTaR is tested with both simulated and real reads from complex organisms. For a complete analysis of its robustness to errors, we use short and long reads with different error rates. The results are then analysed in terms of number of tandem repeats detected and the length of their patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method shows high precision and sensitivity. With low false positive rates even for highly erroneous reads, MixTaR is able to detect accurate tandem repeats with pattern lengths varying within a significant interval.","['Fertin G', 'Jean G', 'Radulescu A', 'Rusu I']",2015,8 Suppl 3,Suppl 3,BMC Med Genomics,"Fertin G, et al.

26392509,High-Throughput Intracellular Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen that causes a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Notably, in the human host, the organism is believed to replicate solely within an intracellular compartment, predominantly within pulmonary macrophages. Consequently, successful therapy is predicated on antimicrobials penetrating into this intracellular growth niche. However, standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods test solely for extracellular growth inhibition. Here, we make use of a high-throughput assay to characterize intracellular growth inhibition activity of known antimicrobials. For select antimicrobials, high-resolution dose-response analysis was then performed to characterize and compare activity levels in both macrophage infection and axenic growth assays. Results support the superiority of several classes of nonpolar antimicrobials in abrogating intracellular growth. Importantly, our assay results show excellent correlations with prior clinical observations of antimicrobial efficacy. Furthermore, we also show the applicability of high-throughput automation to two- and three-dimensional synergy testing. High-resolution isocontour isobolograms provide in vitro support for specific combination antimicrobial therapy. Taken together, findings suggest that high-throughput screening technology may be successfully applied to identify and characterize antimicrobials that target bacterial pathogens that make use of an intracellular growth niche.","['Chiaraviglio L', 'Kirby JE']",2015,59,12,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Chiaraviglio L and Kirby JE.

To gain a better understanding of these factors, we compared the characteristics of Legionella feeleii strains that were isolated from either a sample of freshwater implicated in an outbreak of Pontiac fever (ATCC 35072, serogroup 1, LfPF), or a patient with Legionnaires' disease (ATCC 38549, serogroup 2, LfLD). Growth of LfPF and LfLD in BYE broth was slower than the positive control, Legionella pneumophila strain JR32. However, LfLD grew faster than LfPF at 42 °C. After in vitro infection to J774 murine or U937 human macrophage cell lines and A549 human lung epithelial cell line, LfLD showed a higher cell infection rate, stronger internalization by host cells, and greater cytotoxicity than that of LfPF. Large amounts of IL-6 and IL-8 were secreted by human host cells after infection with LfLD, but not with LfPF. LfLD possessed mono-polar flagellum while LfPF was unflagellated. When LfLD was cultured at 25, 30 and 37 °C, the bacteria had higher motility rate at lower temperatures. Based on our results, this is the first study that showed distinct characteristics between LfPF and LfLD, which may give important leads in elucidating differences in their virulence.","['Wang C', 'Saito M', 'Tanaka T', 'Amako K', 'Yoshida S']",2015,89,,Microb Pathog,"Wang C, et al.

26380880,Crystal structure and tartrate inhibition of Legionella pneumophila histidine acid phosphatase.,"Histidine acid phosphatases (HAPs) utilize a nucleophilic histidine residue to catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group from phosphomonoesters to water. HAPs function as protein phosphatases and pain suppressors in mammals, are essential for Giardia lamblia excystation, and contribute to virulence of the category A pathogen Francisella tularensis. Herein we report the first crystal structure and steady-state kinetics measurements of the HAP from Legionella pneumophila (LpHAP), also known as Legionella major acid phosphatase. The structure of LpHAP complexed with the inhibitor l(+)-tartrate was determined at 2.0 Å resolution. Kinetics assays show that l(+)-tartrate is a 50-fold more potent inhibitor of LpHAP than of other HAPs. Electrostatic potential calculations provide insight into the basis for the enhanced tartrate potency: the tartrate pocket of LpHAP is more positive than other HAPs because of the absence of an ion pair partner for the second Arg of the conserved RHGXRXP HAP signature sequence. The structure also reveals that LpHAP has an atypically expansive active site entrance and lacks the nucleotide substrate base clamp found in other HAPs. These features imply that nucleoside monophosphates may not be preferred substrates. Kinetics measurements confirm that AMP is a relatively inefficient in vitro substrate of LpHAP.","['Dhatwalia R', 'Singh H', 'Reilly TJ', 'Tanner JJ']",2015,585,,Arch Biochem Biophys,"Dhatwalia R, et al.

PCP exposure caused accumulation of PCP in the fish intestinal tract in a time- and dose-dependent manner, while hepatic PCP reached the maximal level after a 21 day exposure. Under the relatively higher PCP stress, the fish body weight and liver weight were reduced and hepatic CAT and SOD activities were inhibited, demonstrating negative correlations with the PCP levels in liver and gut content (R < -0.5 and P < 0.05 each). Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that PCP exposure increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes in the fish gut. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, the Bacteroides genus had the highest abundance, which was significantly correlated with PCP exposure dosage and duration (R > 0.5 and P < 0.05 each). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that Bacteroides showed quantitatively negative correlations with Chryseobacterium, Microbacterium, Arthrobacter, and Legionella in the fish gut, and the Bacteroidetes abundance, Bacteroides abundance, and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio played crucial roles in the reduction of body weight and liver weight under PCP stress.

CASE: A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 28 weeks of gestation presented with a high fever, cough, nausea, and vomiting. She deteriorated despite treatment for presumed urosepsis, was transferred to the intensive care unit, and remained intubated for 10 days receiving cardiovascular support, antivirals, antifungals, and multiple wide-spectrum antibiotics. Legionella infection antigen testing was performed on hospital day 1 and returned as positive. Azithromycin, started before the testing results became available, was continued for 14 days. The patient recovered, and the pregnancy progressed uneventfully to term.

26373823,Surveillance of parasitic Legionella in surface waters by using immunomagnetic separation and amoebae enrichment.,"Free-living amoebae (FLA) are potential reservoirs of Legionella in aquatic environments. However, the parasitic relationship between various Legionella and amoebae remains unclear. In this study, surface water samples were gathered from two rivers for evaluating parasitic Legionella. Warmer water temperature is critical to the existence of Legionella. This result suggests that amoebae may be helpful in maintaining Legionella in natural environments because warmer temperatures could enhance parasitisation of Legionella in amoebae. We next used immunomagnetic separation (IMS) to identify extracellular Legionella and remove most free Legionella before detecting the parasitic ones in selectively enriched amoebae. Legionella pneumophila was detected in all the approaches, confirming that the pathogen is a facultative amoebae parasite. By contrast, two obligate amoebae parasites, Legionella-like amoebal pathogens (LLAPs) 8 and 9, were detected only in enriched amoebae. However, several uncultured Legionella were detected only in the extracellular samples. Because the presence of potential hosts, namely Vermamoeba vermiformis, Acanthamoeba spp. and Naegleria gruberi, was confirmed in the samples that contained intracellular Legionella, uncultured Legionella may survive independently of amoebae. Immunomagnetic separation and amoebae enrichment may have referential value for detecting parasitic Legionella in surface waters.","['Hsu TK', 'Wu SF', 'Hsu BM', 'Kao PM', 'Tao CW', 'Shen SM', 'Ji WT', 'Huang WC', 'Fan CW']",2015,109,7,Pathog Glob Health,"Hsu TK, et al.

To determine if the pathogen species and transmission route affects the size and spread of outbreaks, we perform a meta-analysis that examines data from 933 outbreaks of hospital-acquired infection representing 14 pathogen species and 8 transmission routes. We find that the mean number of cases in an outbreak is best predicted by the pathogen species and the mean number of cases per day is best predicted by the species-transmission route combination. Our fitted model predicts the largest mean number of cases for Salmonella outbreaks (22.3) and the smallest mean number of cases for Streptococci outbreaks (8.5). The largest mean number of cases per day occurs during Salmonella outbreaks spread via the environment (0.33) and the smallest occurs for Legionella outbreaks spread by multiple transmission routes (0.005).

METHODS: This was a matched case-control study enrolling 144 patients with non-pneumococcal severe pneumonia: 72 patients from the 2000-2002 database (CAPUCI I group) were paired with 72 from the 2008-2014 period (CAPUCI II group), matched by the following variables: microorganism, shock at admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, immunocompromise, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and age over 65 years.
RESULTS: The most frequent microorganism was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22.1%) followed by Legionella pneumophila and Haemophilus influenzae (each 20.7%); prevalence of shock was 59.7%, while 73.6% of patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Intensive care unit mortality was significantly lower in the CAPUCI II group (34.7% versus 16.7%; odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.95; p = 0.02). Appropriate therapy according to microorganism was 91.5% in CAPUCI I and 92.7% in CAPUCI II, while combined therapy and early antibiotic treatment were significantly higher in CAPUCI II (76.4 versus 90.3% and 37.5 versus 63.9%; p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, combined antibiotic therapy (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.74) and early antibiotic treatment (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.22) were independently associated with decreased intensive care unit mortality.

The detection rate of flaA, pilE, asd, mip, mompS, proA and neuA genes in the L. pneumophila were 100.0%, respectively. The neuA gene was not detected in the non-L. pneumophila strains, but flaA, pilE, asd, mip, mompS, and proA genes could be amplified with a positive rate of 15.4%, 15.4%, 53.8%, 38.5%, 15.4%, and 38.5%, respectively. The results from real-time PCR were generally consistent with that of PCR. Those L. pneumophila strains were assigned into 10 sequence types (STs) and ST1 (9/29) was the dominant STs. Four new STs were found to be unique in Macau. The analysis of population structure of L. pneumophila strains which isolated from Macau, Guangzhou and Shenzhen indicated that the similar clones were existed and ST1 was the most prevalent STs. However, the distribution of the subtypes isolated from Macau was not the same extensive as those from Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The different detection rates of the 7 virulence genes in different species of Legionella might reflect their own potential for environmental adaptability and pathogenesis. And the data analyzed from STs diversity indicated the Macau L. pneumophila possessed obvious regional specificity and high genetic diversity.","['Xiong L', 'Zhao H', 'Mo Z', 'Shi L']",2015,9,4,Biosci Trends,"Xiong L, et al.

Legionellosis is considered as a preventable illness because bacterial reservoirs can be controlled and removed. Roof-harvested rainwater has attracted significant attention not only as a groundwater recharge but also as a potential alternative source of nonpotable water. We successfully developed ceramic microbeads coated with hydroxyapatite-binding silver/titanium dioxide ceramic composite earthplus™ using the thermal spraying method. The ceramic microbeads were demonstrated to have bactericidal activities against not only Legionella but also coliform and heterotrophic bacteria. Immersing the ceramic microbeads in household rainwater storage tanks was demonstrated to yield the favorable eradication of Legionella organisms. Not only rapid-acting but also long-lasting bactericidal activities of the ceramic microbead were exhibited against Legionella pneumophila. However, time-dependent attenuation of the bactericidal activities against Legionella were also noted in the sustainability appraisal experiment. Therefore, the problems to be overcome surely remain in constantly managing the Legionella-pollution by means of immersing the ceramic microbeads. The results of our investigation apparently indicate that the earthplus™-coated ceramic microbeads would become the favorable tool for Legionella measures in household rainwater storage tanks, which may become the natural reservoir for Legionella species. Our investigation would justify further research and data collection to obtain more reliable procedures to microbiologically regulate the Legionella in rainwater storage tanks.","['Oana K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Yamaki D', 'Sakurada T', 'Nagano N', 'Kawakami Y']",2015,10,,Int J Nanomedicine,"Oana K, et al.

26343456,The Legionella Anti-autophagy Effector RavZ Targets the Autophagosome via PI3P- and Curvature-Sensing Motifs.,"Autophagy is a conserved membrane transport pathway used to destroy pathogenic microbes that access the cytosol of cells. The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila interferes with autophagy by delivering an effector protein, RavZ, into the host cytosol. RavZ acts by cleaving membrane-conjugated Atg8/LC3 proteins from pre-autophagosomal structures. Its remarkable efficiency allows minute quantities of RavZ to block autophagy throughout the cell. To understand how RavZ targets pre-autophagosomes and specifically acts only on membrane-associated Atg8 proteins, we elucidated its structure. Revealed is a catalytic domain related in fold to Ulp family deubiquitinase-like enzymes and a C-terminal PI3P-binding module. RavZ targets the autophagosome via the PI3P-binding module and a catalytic domain helix, and it preferentially binds high-curvature membranes, intimating localization to highly curved domains in autophagosome intermediate membranes. RavZ-membrane interactions enhance substrate affinity, providing a mechanism for interfacial activation that also may be used by host autophagy proteins engaging only lipidated Atg8 proteins.","['Horenkamp FA', 'Kauffman KJ', 'Kohler LJ', 'Sherwood RK', 'Krueger KP', 'Shteyn V', 'Roy CR', 'Melia TJ', 'Reinisch KM']",2015,34,5,Dev Cell,"Horenkamp FA, et al.

Most episodes are of bacterial origin, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequently isolated pathogen. Epidemiological surveillance provides information about changes in microorganisms and their susceptibility. In recent years there has been an increase in cases caused by community-acquired meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Legionella sp. The chest radiograph is essential as a diagnostic tool. CURB-65 score and pulse oximetry allow stratifying patients into those who require outpatient care, general hospital room or admission to intensive care unit. Diagnostic studies and empirical antimicrobial therapy are also based on this stratification. The use of biomarkers such as procalcitonin or C-reactive protein is not part of the initial evaluation because its use has not been shown to modify the initial approach. We recommend treatment with amoxicillin for outpatients under 65 year old and without comorbidities, for patients 65 years or more or with comorbidities amoxicillin-clavulanic/sulbactam, for patients hospitalized in general ward ampicillin-sulbactam with or without the addition of clarithromycin, and for patients admitted to intensive care unit ampicillin-sulbactam plus clarithromycin.

26334694,Residue-Dependent Thermodynamic Cost and Barrel Plasticity Balances Activity in the PhoPQ-Activated Enzyme PagP of Salmonella typhimurium.,"PagP is an eight-stranded transmembrane β-barrel enzyme indispensable for lipid A palmitoylation in Gram-negative bacteria. The severity of infection by pathogens, including Salmonella, Legionella, and Bordetella, and resistance to antimicrobial peptides, relies on lipid A remodeling by PagP, rendering PagP a sought-after drug target. Despite a conserved sequence, more robust palmitoylation of lipid A is observed in Salmonella typhimurium compared to Escherichia coli, a possible consequence of the differential regulation of PagP expression and/or specific activity. Work here identifies molecular signatures that demarcate thermodynamic stability and variances in catalytic efficiency between S. typhimurium (PagP-St) and E. coli (PagP-Ec) transmembrane PagP barrel variants. We demonstrate that Salmonella PagP displays a 2-fold destabilization of the barrel, while achieving 15-20 magnitude higher lipase efficiency, through subtle alterations of lipid-facing residues distal from the active site. We find that catalytic properties of these homologues are retained across different lipid environments such as micelles, vesicles, and natural extracts. By comparing thermodynamic stability with activity of selectively designed mutants, we conclude that activity-stability trade-offs can be influenced by factors secluded from the catalytic region. Our results provide a compelling correlation of the primary protein structure with enzymatic activity, barrel thermodynamic stability, and scaffold plasticity. Our analysis can open avenues for the development of potent pharmaceuticals against salmonellosis.","['Iyer BR', 'Mahalakshmi R']",2015,54,37,Biochemistry,Iyer BR and Mahalakshmi R.

26330609,MavN is a Legionella pneumophila vacuole-associated protein required for efficient iron acquisition during intracellular growth.,"Iron is essential for the growth and virulence of most intravacuolar pathogens. The mechanisms by which microbes bypass host iron restriction to gain access to this metal across the host vacuolar membrane are poorly characterized. In this work, we identify a unique intracellular iron acquisition strategy used by Legionella pneumophila. The bacterial Icm/Dot (intracellular multiplication/defect in organelle trafficking) type IV secretion system targets the bacterial-derived MavN (more regions allowing vacuolar colocalization N) protein to the surface of the Legionella-containing vacuole where this putative transmembrane protein facilitates intravacuolar iron acquisition. The ΔmavN mutant exhibits a transcriptional iron-starvation signature before its growth is arrested during the very early stages of macrophage infection. This intracellular growth defect is rescued only by the addition of excess exogenous iron to the culture medium and not a variety of other metals. Consistent with MavN being a translocated substrate that plays an exclusive role during intracellular growth, the mutant shows no defect for growth in broth culture, even under severe iron-limiting conditions. Putative iron-binding residues within the MavN protein were identified, and point mutations in these residues resulted in defects specific for intracellular growth that are indistinguishable from the ΔmavN mutant. This model of a bacterial protein inserting into host membranes to mediate iron transport provides a paradigm for how intravacuolar pathogens can use virulence-associated secretion systems to manipulate and acquire host iron.","['Isaac DT', 'Laguna RK', 'Valtz N', 'Isberg RR']",2015,112,37,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Isaac DT, et al.

26316537,Host Cell-catalyzed S-Palmitoylation Mediates Golgi Targeting of the Legionella Ubiquitin Ligase GobX.,"The facultative intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires disease, infects and replicates within human alveolar macrophages. L. pneumophila delivers almost 300 effector proteins into the besieged host cell that alter signaling cascades and create conditions that favor intracellular bacterial survival. In order for the effectors to accomplish their intracellular mission, their activity needs to be specifically directed toward the correct host cell protein or target organelle. Here, we show that the L. pneumophila effector GobX possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is mediated by a central region homologous to mammalian U-box domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GobX exploits host cell S-palmitoylation to specifically localize to Golgi membranes. The hydrophobic palmitate moiety is covalently attached to a cysteine residue at position 175, which is part of an amphipathic α-helix within the C-terminal region of GobX. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine 175 or residues on the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix strongly attenuated palmitoylation and Golgi localization of GobX. Together, our study provides evidence that the L. pneumophila effector GobX exploits two post-translational modification pathways of host cells, ubiquitination and S-palmitoylation.","['Lin YH', 'Doms AG', 'Cheng E', 'Kim B', 'Evans TR', 'Machner MP']",2015,290,42,J Biol Chem,"Lin YH, et al.

26307115,The occurrence of antibodies against Legionella pneumophila in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases are more susceptible to infection, owing to the underlying disease itself or to its treatment. Most commonly, infections affect the respiratory and urinary tracts. One of the etiological factors of infections in these patients is the bacteria of the genus Legionella.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anti-Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) antibodies in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases and to analyze individual and environmental risk factors for the development of Legionella infection in patients with positive antibody results.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 165 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases and 100 healthy subjects. Serum samples were tested for the presence of specific antibodies in the immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG classes against L. pneumophila serogroups 1 to 7 (SG 1-7) and the IgG class for serogroup 1 (SG 1).
RESULTS: Antibodies against L. pneumophila were found in 7 patients (4%): 5 cases with antibody positivity only in the IgG class and 2 cases with antibody positivity in both classes. In patients with positive IgG antibodies for SG 1-7, specific antibodies for L. pneumophila SG 1 were not detected. In the control group, positive results were obtained in 9 cases (9%): IgM positivity in 6 (6%) and IgG positivity in 3 (3%).
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of antibodies to L. pneumophila in our patients is comparable to that in healthy individuals. L. pneumophila should be recognized as a potential pathogen in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Primary disease condition, immunosuppressive therapy, and other risk factors should not be ignored in these patients.","['Sikora A', 'Koszarny A', 'Kozioł-Montewka M', 'Majdan M', 'Paluch-Oleś J', 'Kozioł MM']",2015,125,10,Pol Arch Med Wewn,"Sikora A, et al.

26306795,Transcriptomic changes of Legionella pneumophila in water.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is a water-borne opportunistic pathogen. In water, Lp can survive for an extended period of time until it encounters a permissive host. Therefore, identifying genes that are required for survival in water may help develop strategies to prevent Legionella outbreaks.
RESULTS: We compared the global transcriptomic response of Lp grown in a rich medium to that of Lp exposed to an artificial freshwater medium (Fraquil) for 2, 6 and 24 hours. We uncovered successive changes in gene expression required for the successful adaptation to a nutrient-limited water environment. The repression of major pathways involved in cell division, transcription and translation, suggests that Lp enters a quiescent state in water. The induction of flagella associated genes (flg, fli and mot), enhanced-entry genes (enh) and some Icm/Dot effector genes suggests that Lp is primed to invade a suitable host in response to water exposure. Moreover, many genes involved in resistance to antibiotic and oxidative stress were induced, suggesting that Lp may be more tolerant to these stresses in water. Indeed, Lp exposed to water is more resistant to erythromycin, gentamycin and kanamycin than Lp cultured in rich medium. In addition, the bdhA gene, involved in the degradation pathway of the intracellular energy storage compound polyhydroxybutyrate, is also highly expressed in water. Further characterization show that expression of bdhA during short-term water exposure is dependent upon RpoS, which is required for the survival of Lp in water. Deletion of bdhA reduces the survival of Lp in water at 37 °C.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase of antibiotic resistance and the importance of bdhA to the survival of Lp in water seem consistent with the observed induction of these genes when Lp is exposed to water. Other genes that are highly induced upon exposure to water could also be necessary for Lp to maintain viability in the water environment.","['Li L', 'Mendis N', 'Trigui H', 'Faucher SP']",2015,16,1,BMC Genomics,"Li L, et al.

Here, we crystallized three nucleotide binding domains from lpg1496. The C-terminal domain, which is conserved among the SidE family of effectors, is formed of two largely α-helical lobes with a nucleotide binding cleft. A structural homology search has shown similarity to phosphodiesterases involved in cleavage of cyclic nucleotides. We have also crystallized a novel domain that occurs twice in the N-terminal half of the protein that we term the KLAMP domain due to the presence of homologous domains in bacterial histidine kinase-like ATP binding region-containing proteins and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase proteins. Both KLAMP structures are very similar but selectively bind 3',5'-cAMP and ADP. A co-crystal of the KLAMP1 domain with 3',5'-cAMP reveals the contribution of Tyr-61 and Tyr-69 that produces π-stacking interactions with the adenine ring of the nucleotide.

L. pneumophila serogroup 1, mAb type Knoxville, sequence type (ST) 62 was identified as the epidemic strain. This strain was isolated from eight patients and from a cooling tower in the city of Ulm. Based on whole genome sequencing data from one patient strain, we identified an Lvh type IV secretion system containing a CRISPR-Cas system. The CRISPR sequence contains 38 spacer DNA sequences. We used these variable DNA spacers to further subtype the outbreak strain as well as six epidemiologically unrelated strains of CRISPR-Cas positive ST62 strains isolated at various regions in Germany. The first 12 spacer DNAs of eight patient isolates and three environmental isolates from the suspected source of infection were analyzed and found to be identical. Spacer DNAs were identified in further six epidemiologically unrelated patient isolates of L. pneumophila of ST62 in addition to the 12 ""core"" spacers. The presence of new spacer DNAs at the 5' site downstream of the first repeat indicates that these CRISPR-Cas systems seem to be functional. PCR analysis revealed that not all L. pneumophila sg1 ST62 strains investigated exhibited a CRISPR-Cas system.

As RalF is differentially encoded across Rickettsia species (e.g., pseudogenized in all Spotted Fever Group species), it may function in lineage-specific biology and pathogenicity. Herein, we demonstrate RalF of R. typhi (Typhus Group) interacts with the Rickettsia T4SS coupling protein (RvhD4) via its proximal C-terminal sequence. RalF is expressed early during infection, with its inactivation via antibody blocking significantly reducing R. typhi host cell invasion. For R. typhi and R. felis (Transitional Group), RalF ectopic expression revealed subcellular localization with the host plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton. Remarkably, R. bellii (Ancestral Group) RalF showed perinuclear localization reminiscent of ectopically expressed Legionella RalF, for which it shares several structural features. For R. typhi, RalF co-localization with Arf6 and PI(4,5)P2 at entry foci on the host plasma membrane was determined to be critical for invasion. Thus, we propose recruitment of PI(4,5)P2 at entry foci, mediated by RalF activation of Arf6, initiates actin remodeling and ultimately facilitates bacterial invasion. Collectively, our characterization of RalF as an invasin suggests that, despite carrying a similar Arf-GEF unknown from other bacteria, different intracellular lifestyles across Rickettsia and Legionella species have driven divergent roles for RalF during infection. Furthermore, our identification of lineage-specific Arf-GEF utilization across some rickettsial species illustrates different pathogenicity factors that define diverse agents of rickettsial diseases.","['Rennoll-Bankert KE', 'Rahman MS', 'Gillespie JJ', 'Guillotte ML', 'Kaur SJ', 'Lehman SS', 'Beier-Sexton M', 'Azad AF']",2015,11,8,PLoS Pathog,"Rennoll-Bankert KE, et al.

26291573,Highly stable multi-anchored magnetic nanoparticles for optical imaging within biofilms.,"Magnetic nanoparticles are the next tool in medical diagnoses and treatment in many different biomedical applications, including magnetic hyperthermia as alternative treatment for cancer and bacterial infections, as well as the disruption of biofilms. The colloidal stability of the magnetic nanoparticles in a biological environment is crucial for efficient delivery. A surface that can be easily modifiable can also improve the delivery and imaging properties of the magnetic nanoparticle by adding targeting and imaging moieties, providing a platform for additional modification. The strategy presented in this work includes multiple nitroDOPA anchors for robust binding to the surface tied to the same polymer backbone as multiple poly(ethylene oxide) chains for steric stability. This approach provides biocompatibility and enhanced stability in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and phosphate buffer saline (PBS). As a proof of concept, these polymer-particles complexes were then modified with a near infrared dye and utilized in characterizing the integration of magnetic nanoparticles in biofilms. The work presented in this manuscript describes the synthesis and characterization of a nontoxic platform for the labeling of near IR-dyes for bioimaging.","['Stone RC', 'Fellows BD', 'Qi B', 'Trebatoski D', 'Jenkins B', 'Raval Y', 'Tzeng TR', 'Bruce TF', 'McNealy T', 'Austin MJ', 'Monson TC', 'Huber DL', 'Mefford OT']",2015,459,,J Colloid Interface Sci,"Stone RC, et al.

26289365,Heated birthing pools as a source of Legionnaires' disease.,"In June 2014 Public Health England confirmed a case of Legionnaires' disease (LD) in a neonate following birth at home in a hired birthing pool incorporating a heater and a recirculation pump which had been filled in advance of labour. The case triggered a public health investigation and a microbiological survey of an additional ten heated birthing pools hired or recently hired to the general public across England. The birthing pool used by the parent of the confirmed case was identified as the source of the neonate's infection following detection of Legionella pneumophila ST48 in both patient and environmental samples. Legionella species were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction but not culture in a further three pools together with other opportunistic pathogens identified by culture and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry. A Patient Safety Alert from NHS England and Public Health England was issued stating that heated birthing pools filled in advance of labour should not be used for home births. This recommendation remains in place. This investigation in conjunction with other recent reports has highlighted a lack of awareness regarding the microbiological safety of heated birthing pools and their potential to be a source of LD and other opportunistic infections. Furthermore, the investigation raised important considerations with regards to microbiological sampling and testing in such incidents. Public health authorities and clinicians should consider LD in the differential diagnosis of severe respiratory infection in neonates within 14 days of a water birth.","['Collins SL', 'Afshar B', 'Walker JT', 'Aird H', 'Naik F', 'Parry-Ford F', 'Phin N', 'Harrison TG', 'Chalker VJ', 'Sorrell S', 'Cresswell T']",2016,144,4,Epidemiol Infect,"Collins SL, et al.

26268237,[Outbreak of six cases of nosocomial Legionella pneumophila pneumonia].,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and the causes of outbreak of nosocomial pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila.
METHODS: The medical records of 6 cases of nosocomial Legionella pneumophila pneumonia were retrospectively reviewed, and the clinical data of clinical presentation, treatment, and etiologic diagnosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: The 6 patients were health care providers of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Affiliated Hospital of Logistics University of PAPF. There were 5 female and 1 male patients, aged 23 to 27 years. The diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia was made based on a positive Legionella urinary I antigen test. In all the 6 cases, the disease was attributable to inhaling contaminated aerosols produced by the air conditioning system in our hospital. All the 6 patients presented with fever of 37.5-39 °C, and productive cough. One patient had anorexia, dyspnoea, and pleuritic chest pain, while headache was reported in 3 patients. Physical examinations revealed lung rales in 3 patients. Single or multiple patchy infiltrates were found on Chest CT in all patients. However, the typical extrapulmonary manifestations of Legionnaires' disease, including relative bradycardia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia and diarrhea, were not present in the 6 patients. Neither neurological abnormalities nor renal involvement were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that Legionella pneumonia may be mild with atypical laboratory findings and clinical manifestations, with fever, cough, chest tightness, headache, etc. The radiologic manifestations of Legionella pneumonia were single or multiple patchy infiltrates, similar to those of viral pneumonia, and therefore their differential diagnosis was needed. Legionella pneumophila can outbreak through the respiratory tract, in public places with central air-conditioning system, hot water piping systems and hospitals, and therefore microbiological monitoring, cleaning and disinfection of the water system was required for prevention of the outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease.","['Li Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Fan H', 'Wei L']",2015,38,4,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,"Li Y, et al.

26266572,Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry Reveals Unique Conformational and Chemical Transformations Occurring upon [4Fe-4S] Cluster Binding in the Type 2 L-Serine Dehydratase from Legionella pneumophila.,"The type 2 L-serine dehydratase from Legionella pneumophila (lpLSD) contains a [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster that acts as a Lewis acid to extract the hydroxyl group of L-serine during the dehydration reaction. Surprisingly, the crystal structure shows that all four of the iron atoms in the cluster are coordinated with protein cysteinyl residues and that the cluster is buried and not exposed to solvent. If the crystal structure of lpLSD accurately reflects the structure in solution, then substantial rearrangement at the active site is necessary for the substrate to enter. Furthermore, repair of the oxidized protein when the cluster has degraded would presumably entail exposure of the buried cysteine ligands. Thus, the conformation required for the substrate to enter may be similar to those required for a new cluster to enter the active site. To address this, hydrogen-deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry (HDX MS) was used to probe the conformational changes that occur upon oxidative degradation of the Fe-S cluster. The regions that show the most significant differential HDX are adjacent to the cluster location in the holoenzyme or connect regions that are adjacent to the cluster. The observed decrease in flexibility upon cluster binding provides direct evidence that the ""tail-in-mouth"" conformation observed in the crystal structure also occurs in solution and that the C-terminal peptide is coordinated to the [4Fe-4S] cluster in a precatalytic conformation. This observation is consistent with the requirement of an activation step prior to catalysis and the unusually high level of resistance to oxygen-induced cluster degradation. Furthermore, peptide mapping of the apo form under nonreducing conditions revealed the formation of disulfide bonds between C396 and C485 and possibly between C343 and C385. These observations provide a picture of how the cluster loci are stabilized and poised to receive the cluster in the apo form and the requirement for a reduction step during cluster formation.","['Yan Y', 'Grant GA', 'Gross ML']",2015,54,34,Biochemistry,"Yan Y, et al.

In contrast to other enteropathogenic bacteria, Campylobacter has been considered to be non-glycolytic, a metabolic property originally used for their taxonomic classification. Contrary to this dogma, we demonstrate that several Campylobacter coli strains are able to utilize glucose as a growth substrate. Isotopologue profiling experiments with (13) C-labeled glucose suggested that these strains catabolize glucose via the pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways and use glucose efficiently for de novo synthesis of amino acids and cell surface carbohydrates. Whole genome sequencing of glycolytic C. coli isolates identified a genomic island located within a ribosomal RNA gene cluster that encodes for all ED pathway enzymes and a glucose permease. We could show in vitro that a non-glycolytic C. coli strain could acquire glycolytic activity through natural transformation with chromosomal DNA of C. coli and C. jejuni subsp. doylei strains possessing the ED pathway encoding plasticity region. These results reveal for the first time the ability of a Campylobacter species to catabolize glucose and provide new insights into how genetic macrodiversity through intra- and interspecies gene transfer expand the metabolic capacity of this food-borne pathogen.","['Vorwerk H', 'Huber C', 'Mohr J', 'Bunk B', 'Bhuju S', 'Wensel O', 'Spröer C', 'Fruth A', 'Flieger A', 'Schmidt-Hohagen K', 'Schomburg D', 'Eisenreich W', 'Hofreuter D']",2015,98,5,Mol Microbiol,"Vorwerk H, et al.

In this study, a highly sensitive CRP enzyme immunoassay was used to evaluate serum CRP values in patients with viral and atypical bacterial infections. Patients (n = 139) with different viral or atypical bacterial infections (systemic or respiratory) and healthy controls (n = 40) were tested for circulating CRP values. High levels of IgM antibodies against several viruses: Dengue virus (n = 36), Cytomegalovirus (n = 9), Epstein Barr virus (n = 17), Parvovirus B19 (n = 26), Herpes simplex 1 and 2 virus (n = 3) and Influenza A and B (n = 8) and against atypical bacteria: Legionella pneumophila (n = 15), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 21) and Coxiella burnetii (n = 4) were found. High values of CRP in infected patients compared with controls (P < 0.001) were found; however, no significant differences between viral and atypical bacterial infections were found. Low levels of CRP in respiratory and Coxiella burnetii infections compared with exanthematic viral and other atypical bacterial infections were found.

The purpose of this work was to model the effect of temperature and free chlorine applied in similar exposure conditions as in drinking water systems on five Legionella spp. strains and two amoebal strains of the genera Acanthamoeba. Inactivation models obtained were used to determine the effectiveness of the treatments applied which resulted more effective against Legionella than Acanthamoeba, especially those in cystic stages. Furthermore, to determine the influence of the relationship between L. pneumophila and Acanthamoeba spp. on the treatment effectiveness, inactivation models of the bacteria-associated amoeba were also constructed and compared to the models obtained for the free living bacteria state. The Legionella-amoeba association did not change the inactivation models, but it reduced the effectiveness of the treatments applied. Remarkably, at the lowest free chlorine concentration, 0.5 mg L-1, as well as at the lowest temperatures, 50°C and 55°C, the influence of the Legionella-amoeba associate state was the strongest in reducing the effectiveness of the treatments compared to the free Legionella state. Therefore, the association established between L. pneumophila and amoebae in the water systems indicate an increased health risk in proximal areas of the system (close to the tap) where lower free chlorine concentrations and lower temperatures are commonly observed.","['Cervero-Aragó S', 'Rodríguez-Martínez S', 'Puertas-Bennasar A', 'Araujo RM']",2015,10,8,PLoS One,"Cervero-Aragó S, et al.

26232428,Caspase-1 but Not Caspase-11 Is Required for NLRC4-Mediated Pyroptosis and Restriction of Infection by Flagellated Legionella Species in Mouse Macrophages and In Vivo.,"Gram-negative bacteria from the Legionella genus are intracellular pathogens that cause a severe form of pneumonia called Legionnaires' disease. The bacteria replicate intracellularly in macrophages, and the restriction of bacterial replication by these cells is critical for host resistance. The activation of the NAIP5/NLRC4 inflammasome, which is readily triggered in response to bacterial flagellin, is essential for the restriction of bacterial replication in murine macrophages. Once activated, this inflammasome induces pore formation and pyroptosis and facilitates the restriction of bacterial replication in macrophages. Because investigations related to the NLRC4-mediated restriction of Legionella replication were performed using mice double deficient for caspase-1 and caspase-11, we assessed the participation of caspase-1 and caspase-11 in the functions of the NLRC4 inflammasome and the restriction of Legionella replication in macrophages and in vivo. By using several species of Legionella and mice singly deficient for caspase-1 or caspase-11, we demonstrated that caspase-1 but not caspase-11 was required for pore formation, pyroptosis, and restriction of Legionella replication in macrophages and in vivo. By generating F1 mice in a mixed 129 × C57BL/6 background deficient (129 × Casp-11(-/-) ) or sufficient (129 × C57BL/6) for caspase-11 expression, we found that caspase-11 was dispensable for the restriction of Legionella pneumophila replication in macrophages and in vivo. Thus, although caspase-11 participates in flagellin-independent noncanonical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is dispensable for the activities of the NLRC4 inflammasome. In contrast, functional caspase-1 is necessary and sufficient to trigger flagellin/NLRC4-mediated restriction of Legionella spp. infection in macrophages and in vivo.","['Cerqueira DM', 'Pereira MS', 'Silva AL', 'Cunha LD', 'Zamboni DS']",2015,195,5,J Immunol,"Cerqueira DM, et al.

26231463,Legionnaires' disease.,"Since first identified in early 1977, bacteria of the genus Legionella are recognised as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a rare cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Legionella bacteria multisystem manifestations mainly affect susceptible patients as a result of age, underlying debilitating conditions, or immunosuppression. Water is the major natural reservoir for Legionella, and the pathogen is found in many different natural and artificial aquatic environments such as cooling towers or water systems in buildings, including hospitals. The term given to the severe pneumonia and systemic infection caused by Legionella bacteria is Legionnaires' disease. Over time, the prevalence of legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease has risen, which might indicate a greater awareness and reporting of the disease. Advances in microbiology have led to a better understanding of the ecological niches and pathogenesis of the condition. Legionnaires' disease is not always suspected because of its non-specific symptoms, and the diagnostic tests routinely available do not offer the desired sensitivity. However, effective antibiotics are available. Disease notification systems provide the basis for initiating investigations and limiting the scale and recurrence of outbreaks. This report reviews our current understanding of this disease.","['Cunha BA', 'Burillo A', 'Bouza E']",2016,387,10016,Lancet,"Cunha BA, et al. Legionnaires' disease.

26220258,"Legionnaires' Disease in Hotels and Passenger Ships: A Systematic Review of Evidence, Sources, and Contributing Factors.","BACKGROUND: Travel-associated Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a serious problem, and hundreds of cases are reported every year among travelers who stayed at hotels, despite the efforts of international and governmental authorities and hotel operators to prevent additional cases.
METHODS: A systematic review of travel-associated LD events (cases, clusters, outbreaks) and of environmental studies of Legionella contamination in accommodation sites was conducted. Two databases were searched (PubMed and EMBASE). Data were extracted from 50 peer-reviewed articles that provided microbiological and epidemiological evidence for linking the accommodation sites with LD. The strength of evidence was classified as strong, possible, and probable.
RESULTS: Three of the 21 hotel-associated events identified and four of nine ship-associated events occurred repeatedly on the same site. Of 197 hotel-associated cases, 158 (80.2%) were linked to hotel cooling towers and/or potable water systems. Ship-associated cases were most commonly linked to hot tubs (59/83, 71.1%). Common contributing factors included inadequate disinfection, maintenance, and monitoring; water stagnation; poor temperature control; and poor ventilation. Across all 30 events, Legionella concentrations in suspected water sources were >10,000 cfu/L, <10,000 cfu/L, and unknown in 11, 3, and 13 events, respectively. In five events, Legionella was not detected only after repeated disinfections. In environmental studies, Legionella was detected in 81.1% of ferries (23/28) and 48.9% of hotels (587/1,200), while all 12 cruise ships examined were negative.
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the need for LD awareness strategies targeting operators of accommodation sites. Increased standardization of LD investigation and reporting, and more rigorous follow-up of LD events, would help generate stronger, more comparable evidence on LD sources, contributing factors, and control measure effectiveness.","['Mouchtouri VA', 'Rudge JW']",2015,22,5,J Travel Med,"Mouchtouri VA and Rudge JW.

26218559,Efficiency of a closed-coupled solar pasteurization system in treating roof harvested rainwater.,"Many studies have concluded that roof harvested rainwater is susceptible to chemical and microbial contamination. The aim of the study was thus to conduct a preliminary investigation into the efficiency of a closed-coupled solar pasteurization system in reducing the microbiological load in harvested rainwater and to determine the change in chemical components after pasteurization. The temperature of the pasteurized tank water samples collected ranged from 55 to 57°C, 64 to 66°C, 72 to 74°C, 78 to 81°C and 90 to 91°C. Cations analyzed were within drinking water guidelines, with the exception of iron [195.59 μg/L (55°C)-170.1 μg/L (91°C)], aluminum [130.98 μg/L (78°C)], lead [12.81 μg/L (55°C)-13.2 μg/L (91°C)] and nickel [46.43 μg/L (55°C)-32.82 μg/L (78°C)], which were detected at levels above the respective guidelines in the pasteurized tank water samples. Indicator bacteria including, heterotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli and total coliforms were reduced to below the detection limit at pasteurization temperatures of 72°C and above. However, with the use of molecular techniques Yersinia spp., Legionella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were detected in tank water samples pasteurized at temperatures greater than 72°C. The viability of the bacteria detected in this study at the higher temperature ranges should thus be assessed before pasteurized harvested rainwater is used as a potable water source. In addition, it is recommended that the storage tank of the pasteurization system be constructed from an alternative material, other than stainless steel, in order for a closed-coupled pasteurization system to be implemented and produce large quantities of potable water from roof harvested rainwater.","['Dobrowsky PH', 'Carstens M', 'De Villiers J', 'Cloete TE', 'Khan W']",2015,536,,Sci Total Environ,"Dobrowsky PH, et al.

26218315,Real-time PCR to supplement gold-standard culture-based detection of Legionella in environmental samples.,"AIMS: Culture remains the gold-standard for the enumeration of environmental Legionella. However, it has several drawbacks including long incubation and poor sensitivity, causing delays in response times to outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. This study aimed to validate real-time PCR assays to quantify Legionella species (ssrA gene), Legionella pneumophila (mip gene) and Leg. pneumophila serogroup-1 (wzm gene) to support culture-based detection in a frontline public health laboratory.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Each qPCR assay had 100% specificity, excellent sensitivity (5 GU/reaction) and reproducibility. Comparison of the assays to culture-based enumeration of Legionella from 200 environmental samples showed that they had a negative predictive value of 100%. Thirty eight samples were positive for Legionella species by culture and qPCR. One hundred samples were negative by both methods, whereas 62 samples were negative by culture but positive by qPCR. The average log10 increase between culture and qPCR for Legionella spp. and Leg. pneumophila was 0·72 (P = 0·0002) and 0·51 (P = 0·006), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The qPCR assays can be conducted on the same 1 l water sample as culture thus can be used as a supplementary technique to screen out negative samples and allow more rapid indication of positive samples.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay could prove informative in public health investigations to identify or rule out sources of Legionella as well as to specifically identify Leg. pneumophila serogroup 1 in a timely manner not possible with culture.","['Collins S', 'Jorgensen F', 'Willis C', 'Walker J']",2015,119,4,J Appl Microbiol,"Collins S, et al.

26216429,Dot/Icm Effector Translocation by Legionella longbeachae Creates a Replicative Vacuole Similar to That of Legionella pneumophila despite Translocation of Distinct Effector Repertoires.,"Legionella organisms are environmental bacteria and accidental human pathogens that can cause severe pneumonia, termed Legionnaires' disease. These bacteria replicate within a pathogen-derived vacuole termed the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). Our understanding of the development and dynamics of this vacuole is based on extensive analysis of Legionella pneumophila. Here, we have characterized the Legionella longbeachae replicative vacuole (longbeachae-LCV) and demonstrated that, despite important genomic differences, key features of the replicative LCV are comparable to those of the LCV of L. pneumophila (pneumophila-LCV). We constructed a Dot/Icm-deficient strain by deleting dotB and demonstrated the inability of this mutant to replicate inside THP-1 cells. L. longbeachae does not enter THP-1 cells as efficiently as L. pneumophila, and this is reflected in the observation that translocation of BlaM-RalFLLO (where RalFLLO is the L. longbeachae homologue of RalF) into THP-1 cells by the L. longbeachae Dot/Icm system is less efficient than that by L. pneumophila. This difference is negated in A549 cells where L. longbeachae and L. pneumophila infect with similar entry dynamics. A β-lactamase assay was employed to demonstrate the translocation of a novel family of proteins, the Rab-like effector (Rle) proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that these proteins enter the host cell during infection and display distinct subcellular localizations, with RleA and RleC present on the longbeachae-LCV. We observed that the host Rab GTPase, Rab1, and the v-SNARE Sec22b are also recruited to the longbeachae-LCV during the early stages of infection, coinciding with the LCV avoiding endocytic maturation. These studies further our understanding of the L. longbeachae replicative vacuole, highlighting phenotypic similarities to the vacuole of L. pneumophila as well as unique aspects of LCV biology.","['Wood RE', 'Newton P', 'Latomanski EA', 'Newton HJ']",2015,83,10,Infect Immun,"Wood RE, et al.

Hot water systems, including showers, have been identified as a potential source of infection. This paper describes the colonization of Legionella and MAC on the flexible tubing within a model potable shower system, utilizing thermostatic mixing and a flexible shower head. A MAC qPCR method of enumeration was also developed. MAC and Legionella spp. were detected within the biofilm at maximum concentrations of 7.0 × 104 and 2.0 × 103 copies/cm2 PVC tubing respectively. No significant changes were observed between sample of the flexible shower tubing that dried between uses and those that remained filled with water. This suggested the ""unhooking"" showerheads and allowing them to dry is not an effective method to reduce the risk of Legionella or MAC colonisation.","['Whiley H', 'Giglio S', 'Bentham R']",2015,4,3,Pathogens,"Whiley H, et al.

26212142,Design and application of a core genome multilocus sequence typing scheme for investigation of Legionnaires' disease incidents.,"Sequence-based typing (SBT) for Legionella pneumophila (Lp) has dramatically improved Legionnaires’ disease (LD) cluster investigation. Microbial whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a promising modality for investigation but sequence analysis methods are neither standardised, nor agreed. We sought to develop a WGS-based typing scheme for Lp using de novo assembly and a genome-wide gene-by-gene approach (core genome multilocus sequence typing, cgMLST). We analysed 17 publicly available Lp genomes covering the whole species variation to define a core genome (1,521 gene targets) which was validated using 21 additional published genomes. The genomes of 12 Lp strains implicated in three independent cases of paediatric humidifier-associated LD were subject to cgMLST together with three 'outgroup' strains. cgMLST was able to resolve clustered strains and clearly identify related and unrelated strains. Thus, a cgMLST scheme was readily achievable and provided high-resolution analysis of Lp strains. cgMLST appears to have satisfactory discriminatory power for LD cluster analysis and is advantageous over mapping followed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling as it is portable and easier to standardise. cgMLST thus has the potential for becoming a gold standard tool for LD investigation. Humidifiers pose an ongoing risk as vehicles for LD and should be considered in cluster investigation and control efforts.","['Moran-Gilad J', 'Prior K', 'Yakunin E', 'Harrison TG', 'Underwood A', 'Lazarovitch T', 'Valinsky L', 'Luck C', 'Krux F', 'Agmon V', 'Grotto I', 'Harmsen D']",2015,20,28,Euro Surveill,"Moran-Gilad J, et al.

26205420,Structures of DegQ from Legionella pneumophila Define Distinct ON and OFF States.,"HtrA (high-temperature requirement A) family proteins play important roles in protein-quality control processes in the bacterial periplasm. A common feature of all members of this family is their modular organization comprising a chymotrypsin-like protease domain and at least one PDZ (postsynaptic density of 95 kDa, disks large homolog 1 and zonula occludens 1) domain. All characterized HtrA proteins assemble into complex oligomers consisting of typically 3-24 monomers, which allow a tight regulation of proteolytic activity. Here, we provide evidence that the assembly of proteolytically active, higher-order complexes of DegQ from Legionella pneumophila is triggered by the binding of substrate-derived peptides. Crystal structures of inactive 3-mers and active 12-mers of DegQ reveal molecular details of elements of a conserved allosteric activation cascade that defines distinct protease ON and OFF states. Results from DegQ(Lp) variants harboring structure-based amino acid substitutions indicate that peptide binding to the PDZ1 domain is critical for proteolytic activity but not for the formation of higher-order oligomers. Combining structural, mutagenesis and biochemical data, we show that, in contrast to the proteolytic activity, the chaperone function of DegQ is not affected by the state of the activation cascade.","['Schubert A', 'Wrase R', 'Hilgenfeld R', 'Hansen G']",2015,427,17,J Mol Biol,"Schubert A, et al.

26195554,The Legionella pneumophila Siderophore Legiobactin Is a Polycarboxylate That Is Identical in Structure to Rhizoferrin.,"Legionella pneumophila, the agent of Legionnaires' disease, secretes a siderophore (legiobactin) that promotes bacterial infection of the lung. In past work, we determined that cytoplasmic LbtA (from Legiobactin gene A) promotes synthesis of legiobactin, inner membrane LbtB aids in export of the siderophore, and outer membrane LbtU and inner membrane LbtC help mediate ferrilegiobactin uptake and assimilation. However, the past studies examined legiobactin contained within bacterial culture supernatants. By utilizing high-pressure liquid chromatography that incorporates hydrophilic interaction-based chemistry, we have now purified legiobactin from supernatants of virulent strain 130b that is suitable for detailed chemical analysis. High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) revealed that the molecular mass of (protonated) legiobactin is 437.140 Da. On the basis of the results obtained from both MS analysis and various forms of nuclear magnetic resonance, we found that legiobactin is composed of two citric acid residues linked by a putrescine bridge and thus is identical in structure to rhizoferrin, a polycarboxylate-type siderophore made by many fungi and several unrelated bacteria. Both purified legiobactin and rhizoferrin obtained from the fungus Cunninghamella elegans were able to promote Fe(3+) uptake by wild-type L. pneumophila as well as enhance growth of iron-starved bacteria. These results did not occur with 130b mutants lacking lbtU or lbtC, indicating that both endogenously made legiobactin and exogenously derived rhizoferrin are assimilated by L. pneumophila in an LbtU- and LbtC-dependent manner.","['Burnside DM', 'Wu Y', 'Shafaie S', 'Cianciotto NP']",2015,83,10,Infect Immun,"Burnside DM, et al.

26188406,Legionella pneumophila: From potable water to treated greywater; quantification and removal during treatment.,"Greywater is an alternative water source that can help alleviate stress on depleted water resources. The main options for greywater reuse are toilet flushing and garden irrigation, both producing aerosols. For that reason transmission of inhalable pathogens like Legionella present a potential risk. To improve the understanding about Legionella in greywater, we traced the pathogen seasonally from the potable water system to the final steps of the greywater treatment in four houses in northern Israel. Physicochemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed in order to assess background greywater quality and to establish possible associations with Legionella. The mean concentrations of Legionella pneumophila isolated from the potable water system were 6.4×10(2) and 5.9×10(3) cfu/l in cold and hot water respectively. By amending the ISO protocol for Legionella isolation from drinking water, we succeeded in quantifying Legionella in greywater. The mean Legionella concentrations that were found in raw, treated and treated chlorinated greywater were 1.2×10(5), 2.4×10(4) and 5.7×10(3) cfu/l respectively. While Legionella counts in potable water presented a seasonal pattern with high concentrations in summer, its counts in greywater presented an almost inversed pattern. Greywater treatment resulted in 95% decrease in Legionella counts. No significant difference was found between Legionella concentrations in potable water and the treated chlorinated greywater. These findings indicate that regarding Legionella, reusing treated chlorinated greywater would exhibit a risk that is very similar to the risk associated with using potable water for the same non-potable uses.","['Blanky M', 'Rodríguez-Martínez S', 'Halpern M', 'Friedler E']",2015,533,,Sci Total Environ,"Blanky M, et al.

26184706,Assessment of Legionella pneumophila in recreational spring water with quantitative PCR (Taqman) assay.,"Legionella spp. are common in various natural and man-made aquatic environments. Recreational hot spring is frequently reported as an infection hotspot because of various factors such as temperature and humidity. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) had been used for detecting Legionella, several inhibitors such as humic substances, calcium, and melanin in the recreational spring water may interfere with the reaction thus resulting in risk underestimation. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficiencies of conventional and Taqman quantitative PCR (qPCR) on detecting Legionella pneumophila in spring facilities and in receiving water. In the results, Taqman PCR had much better efficiency on specifying the pathogen in both river and spring samples. L. pneumophila was detected in all of the 27 river water samples and 45 of the 48 hot spring water samples. The estimated L. pneumophela concentrations ranged between 1.0 × 10(2) and 3.3 × 10(5) cells/l in river water and 72.1-5.7 × 10(6) cells/l in hot spring water. Total coliforms and turbidity were significantly correlated with concentrations of L. pneumophila in positive water samples. Significant difference was also found in water temperature between the presence/absence of L. pneumophila. Our results suggest that conventional PCR may be not enough for detecting L. pneumophila particularly in the aquatic environments full of reaction inhibitors.","['Shen SM', 'Chou MY', 'Hsu BM', 'Ji WT', 'Hsu TK', 'Tsai HF', 'Huang YL', 'Chiu YC', 'Kao ES', 'Kao PM', 'Fan CW']",2015,109,5,Pathog Glob Health,"Shen SM, et al.

Water is processed in buildings before use; this can degrade the quality of the water. Processing steps undertaken on-site in buildings often include conditioning, filtering, storing, heating, cooling, pressure regulation and distribution through fixtures that restrict flow and temperature. Therefore, prevention of disease and injury requires process management. A process management framework for buildings is the hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) adaptation of failure mode effects analysis (FMEA). It has been proven effective for building water system management. Validation is proof that hazards have been controlled under operating conditions and may include many kinds of evidence including cultures of building water samples to detect and enumerate potentially pathogenic microorganisms. However, results from culture tests are often inappropriately used because the accuracy and precision are not sufficient to support specifications for control limit or action triggers. A reliable negative screen is based on genus-level Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for Legionella in building water systems; however, building water samples with positive results from this test require further analysis by culture methods.","['McCoy WF', 'Rosenblatt AA']",2015,4,3,Pathogens,McCoy WF and Rosenblatt AA.

This study investigated whether V. vermiformis is able to act as a vector for potentially pathogenic bacteria and so aid their dispersal within DUWL systems. Clinical dental water was initially examined for Legionella species by inoculating it onto Legionella selective-medium plates. The molecular identity/profile of the glassy colonies obtained indicated none of these isolates were Legionella species. During this work bacterial colonies were identified as a non-pigmented Serratia marcescens. As the water was from a clinical DUWL which had been treated with Alpron™, this prompted the question as to whether S. marcescens had developed resistance to the biocide. Exposure to Alpron™ indicated that this dental biocide was effective, under laboratory conditions, against S. marcescens at up to 1 × 10(8) colony forming units/millilitre (cfu/ml). V. vermiformis was cultured for 8 weeks on cells of S. marcescens and Escherichia coli. Subsequent electron microscopy showed that V. vermiformis grew equally well on S. marcescens and E. coli (P = 0.0001). Failure to detect the presence of S. marcescens within the encysted amoebae suggests that V. vermiformis is unlikely to act as a vector supporting the growth of this newly isolated, nosocomial bacterium.","['Lal S', 'Singhrao SK', 'Achilles-Day UE', 'Morton LH', 'Pearce M', 'Crean S']",2015,71,4,Curr Microbiol,"Lal S, et al.

The results of this review indicate that most guidelines emphasize adequate design and maintenance of water systems and water temperatures; however, guidance regarding routine preventative environmental testing for Legionella bacteria is not uniform among various jurisdictions, and facilities are generally left without clear guidance on this issue. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend such testing in LTCFs, in contrast to the Veterans Health Administration and Environmental Protection Agency. Internationally, the World Health Organization recommends routine environmental testing, as do Ireland; France; The Netherlands; South Africa; Vienna, Austria; and Queensland, Australia. Among domestic and international guidelines in favor of environmental testing, recommendations on the frequency of testing for Legionella in water systems vary.

26154259,"[Amendments to the Drinking Water Ordinance: Legionellae in Hot Water Systems - Data from the Public Health Authority Frankfurt am Main, Germany].","BACKGROUND: The first and second amendment to the Drinking Water Ordinance came in to force in the years 2011 and 2012 causing additional tasks and responsibilities for operators of commercial large-scale systems, usually hot water systems in large residential buildings, and for the local health authorities. This article describes the experiences of the health authority in Frankfurt/Main with these new regulations. Some of the revisions in the first amendment of the ordinance (TrinkwV 2001 (2011)) were omitted in the second revision (TrinkwV 2001 (2012)) such as the obligation to notify for large-scale systems. Furthermore, the intervals between the obligatory inspections were extended from 1 to 3 years and merely exceedances of the legal limits were to be notified in contrast to the previous obligation to notify all values.
RESULTS: On the basis of the TrinkwV 2001 (2011) a large additional staff requirement had been estimated (13/21 positions). After the TrinkwV 2001 (2012) the tasks can be accomplished by less than 2 employees. While the notification obligation was still in force, the health authority received 4,461 notifications of large-scale systems, since then a further 477 have been notified. Of a total of 1,335 initial analyses, 794 (60%) exceeded the technical action value and in 113 properties with values exceeding 10,000/100 ml a usage restriction was necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the suspension of the notification obligation to report any result of the analyses performed the assessment of the reports on large-scale systems has become difficult. An appropriate assessment of the implementation of the regulation is not possible, since the total number of large-scale systems is not known and a failure to report may result from a measured value below the technical action value as well as from a not inspected system. The large number of usage restrictions is an indication for the necessity to inspect and if required to treat and restore the system.","['Westphal T', 'Voigt K', 'Heudorf U']",2015,77,7,Gesundheitswesen,"Westphal T, et al.

27622823,Amoebae-Based Screening Reveals a Novel Family of Compounds Restricting Intracellular Legionella pneumophila.,"The causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, Legionella pneumophila, grows in environmental amoebae and mammalian macrophages within a distinct compartment, the 'Legionella-containing vacuole' (LCV). Intracellular bacteria are protected from many antibiotics, and thus are notoriously difficult to eradicate. To identify novel compounds that restrict intracellular bacterial replication, we previously developed an assay based on a coculture of amoebae and GFP-producing L. pneumophila. This assay was used to screen a pathway-based, highly diverse chemical library, referred to as the Sinergia library. In this work, we chose to focus on a group of 11 hit compounds, the majority of which originated from the query molecule CN585, a compound that targets the protein phosphatase calcineurin. Further studies on 78 related compound variants revealed crucial structural attributes, namely a triple-ring scaffold with a central triazine moiety, substituted in positions 3 and 5 by two piperidine or pyrrolidine rings, and in position 1 by an amine group bearing a single aliphatic chain moiety. The most effective compound, ZINC00615682, inhibited intracellular replication of L. pneumophila with an IC50 of approximately 20 nM in Acanthamoeba castellanii and slightly less efficiently in Dictyostelium discoideum or macrophages. Pharmacological and genetic attempts to implicate calcineurin in the intracellular replication of L. pneumophila failed. Taken together, these results show that the amoebae-based screen and structure-activity relationship analysis is suitable for the identification of novel inhibitors of the intracellular replication of L. pneumophila. The most potent compound identified in this study targets (an) as yet unidentified host factor(s).","['Harrison CF', 'Chiriano G', 'Finsel I', 'Manske C', 'Hoffmann C', 'Steiner B', 'Kranjc A', 'Patthey-Vuadens O', 'Kicka S', 'Trofimov V', 'Ouertatani-Sakouhi H', 'Soldati T', 'Scapozza L', 'Hilbi H']",2015,1,7,ACS Infect Dis,"Harrison CF, et al.

26149750,Use of copper-silver ionization for the control of legionellae in alkaline environments at health care facilities.,"BACKGROUND: There are multiple treatment options for the control of legionellae in premise hot water systems. Water chemistry plays a role in the efficacy of these treatments and should be considered when selecting a treatment. This study demonstrated the efficacy of copper-silver ionization (CSI) under alkaline water conditions in 2 health care facilities.
METHODS: Monitoring for copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) ions was performed, and the corresponding percentage of positive Legionella cultures was monitored. Low Legionella colony forming units (CFU), with a mean <10 CFU/100 mL, and ≤30% positive culture for each sampling period, along with no recurrent disease, were considered indicative of control.
RESULTS: CSI treatment was shown to reduce both the number of CFU found and the percentage of samples found to be culture positive. After treatment was established, culture positivity was, for example, reduced from 70% (>10(3) CFU/100 mL) to consistently <30% (38 CFU/100 mL).
CONCLUSION: Control of legionellae in premise water systems may be a complex process requiring long-term assessments for adequate control. This work found that CSI could be successful in controlling Legionella under alkaline water conditions, and the evidence suggests that Ag ions are responsible for the control of Legionella pneumophila 1, L pneumophila 6, and L anisa.","['Dziewulski DM', 'Ingles E', 'Codru N', 'Strepelis J', 'Schoonmaker-Bopp D']",2015,43,9,Am J Infect Control,"Dziewulski DM, et al.

The bacterial enzyme AnkX from Legionella pneumophila has been established to transfer functional phosphocholine moieties from synthetically produced CDP-choline derivatives to N-termini, C-termini, and internal loop regions in proteins of interest. Furthermore, the covalent modification can be hydrolytically removed by the action of the Legionella enzyme Lem3. Only a short peptide sequence (eight amino acids) is required for efficient protein labeling and a small linker group (PEG-phosphocholine) is introduced to attach the conjugated cargo.","['Heller K', 'Ochtrop P', 'Albers MF', 'Zauner FB', 'Itzen A', 'Hedberg C']",2015,54,35,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,"Heller K, et al.

26142386,Improved PCR assay for the species-specific identification and quantitation of Legionella pneumophila in water.,"Legionellosis outbreak is a major global health care problem. However, current Legionella risk assessments may be compromised by uncertainties in Legionella detection methods, infectious dose, and strain infectivity. These limitations may place public health at significant risk, leading to significant monetary losses in health care. However, there are still unmet needs for its rapid identification and monitoring of legionellae in water systems. Therefore, in the present study, a primer set was designed based on a LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) family protein gene of Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1 because it was found that this gene is structurally diverse among species through BLAST searches. The specificity of the primer set was evaluated using genomic DNA from 6 strains of L. pneumophila, 5 type strains of other related Legionella species, and other 29 reference pathogenic bacteria. The primer set used in the PCR assay amplified a 264-bp product for only targeted six strains of L. pneumophila. The assay was also able to detect at least 1.39 × 10(3) copies/μl of cloned amplified target DNA using purified DNA or 7.4 × 10(0) colony-forming unit per reaction when using calibrated cell suspension. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of this assay were confirmed by successful detection of Legionella pneumophila in environmental water samples.","['Cho MS', 'Ahn TY', 'Joh K', 'Lee ES', 'Park DS']",2015,99,21,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,"Cho MS, et al.

In this evaluation, the new test had a significantly higher sensitivity than the BinaxNOW® lateral flow tests and the Binax® EIA test.

26141497,[Analysis of severe Legionellosis hospitalized in intensive care units in Tunisia].,"This study is the first one that describes the situation of Legionnaires' disease (LD) in Tunisia, with its clinical and epidemiological characteristics and investigates the risk factors associated with Legionella infections in our country. We conducted a retrospective multicentric study during 5 years (2008-2012) concerning all confirmed LD cases in Tunisia and we investigated risk factors for infection. The total of confirmed LD cases was 14. Incidence was 0.03. Mean age: 53.1, sex ratio (M/F): 2.6. Summer-autumnal peak was noted. Risk factors for infection were: the great humidity at home (n=4), living in community (n=3) and practice ablutions (before prayer) in public places (n=4). Community acquired legionellosis (n=9) and nosocomial (n=2). Pulmonary symptoms (n=11)+/-gastrointestinal (n=6) and/or neurological signs (n=4). Beta lactams therapy failed (n=11). CXR showed bilateral lesions (n=6). Abnormalities in laboratory values were noted: hyponatremia (n=9), high CPK levels (n=9). Diagnosis was confirmed by positive urinary Legionella antigens test (n=10) and by direct immunofluorescence (n=1). Treatment was based on bitherapy (n=10). Five patients died. The incidence of LD appears lower than other countries. Some risk factors, as ablutions, are different from that reported in Western countries and seem to be specific to our society. Given the seriousness of its consequences, it is strongly recommended to improve the national surveillance system up and register LD as notifiable disease.","['Marzouk M', 'Boukadida A', 'Chouchene I', 'Ferjani A', 'Hannachi N', 'Besbes M', 'Bouchoucha S', 'Boukadida J']",2015,108,3,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,"Marzouk M, et al.

It is commonly encountered in recycled water and is typically associated with amoeba, notably Naegleria fowleri (also on the CCL) and Acanthamoeba sp. No legionellosis outbreak has been linked to recycled water and it is important for the industry to proactively keep things that way.

26132833,A yeast two-hybrid screen reveals a strong interaction between the Legionella chaperonin Hsp60 and the host cell small heat shock protein Hsp10.,"L. pneumophila is an intracellular bacterium that replicates inside a membrane-bound vacuole called Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), where it plentifully liberates its HtpB chaperonin. From LCV, HtpB reaches the host cell cytoplasm, where it interacts with SAMDC, a cytoplasmic protein required for synthesis of host polyamines that are important for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. Additionally, cytoplasmic expression of HtpB in S. cerevisiae induces pseudohyphal growth, and in mammalian cells recruits mitochondria to LCV, and modifies actin microfilaments organization. This led us to hypothesize here that HtpB recruits a protein(s) from eukaryotic cells that is involved in the emergence of the aforementioned phenotypes. To identify this protein, a commercially available HeLa cDNA library was screened using a yeast two-hybrid system. Approximately 5×10(6) yeast clones carrying HeLa cDNA library plasmid were screened. Twenty-one positive clones were identified. DNA sequence analysis revealed that all of these positive clones encoded the mammalian small heat shock protein Hsp10. Based on the fact that chaperonions are required to interact with co-chaperonins to function properly in protein folding, we believe that HtpB recruits the host cell Hsp10 to appropriately interact with SAMDC and to induce the multifunction phenotypes deemed important in L. pneumophila pathogenesis.",['Nasrallah GK'],2015,62,2,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung,Nasrallah GK.

26131925,Identification of vacuoles containing extraintestinal differentiated forms of Legionella pneumophila in colonized Caenorhabditis elegans soil nematodes.,"Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is a facultative intracellular parasite of freshwater protozoa. Legionella pneumophila features a unique developmental network that involves several developmental forms including the infectious cyst forms. Reservoirs of L. pneumophila include natural and man-made freshwater systems; however, recent studies have shown that isolates of L. pneumophila can also be obtained directly from garden potting soil suggesting the presence of an additional reservoir. A previous study employing the metazoan Caenorhabditis elegans, a member of the Rhabditidae family of free-living soil nematodes, demonstrated that the intestinal lumen can be colonized with L. pneumophila. While both replicative forms and differentiated forms were observed in C. elegans, these morphologically distinct forms were initially observed to be restricted to the intestinal lumen. Using live DIC imaging coupled with focused transmission electron microscopy analyses, we report here that L. pneumophila is able to invade and establish Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCVs) in the intestinal cells. In addition, LCVs containing replicative and differentiated cyst forms were observed in the pseudocoelomic cavity and gonadal tissue of nematodes colonized with L. pneumophila. Furthermore, establishment of LCVs in the gonadal tissue was Dot/Icm dependent and required the presence of the endocytic factor RME-1 to gain access to maturing oocytes. Our findings are novel as this is the first report, to our knowledge, of extraintestinal LCVs containing L. pneumophila cyst forms in C. elegans tissues, highlighting the potential of soil-dwelling nematodes as an alternate environmental reservoir for L. pneumophila.","['Hellinga JR', 'Garduño RA', 'Kormish JD', 'Tanner JR', 'Khan D', 'Buchko K', 'Jimenez C', 'Pinette MM', 'Brassinga AK']",2015,4,4,Microbiologyopen,"Hellinga JR, et al.

26123442,Raman spectroscopic differentiation of planktonic bacteria and biofilms.,"Both biofilm formations as well as planktonic cells of water bacteria such as diverse species of the Legionella genus as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were examined in detail by Raman microspectroscopy. Production of various molecules involved in biofilm formation of tested species in nutrient-deficient media such as tap water was observed and was particularly evident in the biofilms formed by six Legionella species. Biofilms of selected species of the Legionella genus differ significantly from the planktonic cells of the same organisms in their lipid amount. Also, all Legionella species have formed biofilms that differ significantly from the biofilms of the other tested genera in the amount of lipids they produced. We believe that the significant increase in the synthesis of this molecular species may be associated with the ability of Legionella species to form biofilms. In addition, a combination of Raman microspectroscopy with chemometric approaches can distinguish between both planktonic form and biofilms of diverse bacteria and could be used to identify samples which were unknown to the identification model. Our results provide valuable data for the development of fast and reliable analytic methods based on Raman microspectroscopy, which can be applied to the analysis of tap water-adapted microorganisms without any cultivation step.","['Kusić D', 'Kampe B', 'Ramoji A', 'Neugebauer U', 'Rösch P', 'Popp J']",2015,407,22,Anal Bioanal Chem,"Kusić D, et al.

26121595,Distribution System Water Quality Affects Responses of Opportunistic Pathogen Gene Markers in Household Water Heaters.,"Illustrative distribution system operation and management practices shaped the occurrence and persistence of Legionella spp., nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two amoebae host (Acanthamoeba spp., Vermamoeba vermiformis) gene markers in the effluent of standardized simulated household water heaters (SWHs). The interplay between disinfectant type (chlorine or chloramine), water age (2.3-5.7 days) and materials (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cement or iron) in upstream simulated distribution systems (SDSs) profoundly influenced levels of pathogen gene markers in corresponding SWH bulk waters. For example, Legionella spp. were 3-4 log higher in SWHs receiving water from chloraminated vs chlorinated SDSs, because of disinfectant decay from nitrification. By contrast, SWHs fed with chlorinated PVC SDS water not only harbored the lowest levels of all pathogen markers, but effluent from the chlorinated SWHs were even lower than influent levels in several instances (e.g., 2 log less Legionella spp. and NTM for PVC and 3-5 log less P. aeruginosa for cement). However, pathogen gene marker influent levels correlated positively to effluent levels in the SWHs (P < 0.05). Likewise, microbial community structures were similar between SWHs and the corresponding SDS feed waters. This study highlights the importance and challenges of distribution system management/operation to help control opportunistic pathogens.","['Wang H', 'Masters S', 'Falkinham JO', 'Edwards MA', 'Pruden A']",2015,49,14,Environ Sci Technol,"Wang H, et al.

26102291,Environmental (Saprozoic) Pathogens of Engineered Water Systems: Understanding Their Ecology for Risk Assessment and Management.,"Major waterborne (enteric) pathogens are relatively well understood and treatment controls are effective when well managed. However, water-based, saprozoic pathogens that grow within engineered water systems (primarily within biofilms/sediments) cannot be controlled by water treatment alone prior to entry into water distribution and other engineered water systems. Growth within biofilms or as in the case of Legionella pneumophila, primarily within free-living protozoa feeding on biofilms, results from competitive advantage. Meaning, to understand how to manage water-based pathogen diseases (a sub-set of saprozoses) we need to understand the microbial ecology of biofilms; with key factors including biofilm bacterial diversity that influence amoebae hosts and members antagonistic to water-based pathogens, along with impacts from biofilm substratum, water temperature, flow conditions and disinfectant residual-all control variables. Major saprozoic pathogens covering viruses, bacteria, fungi and free-living protozoa are listed, yet today most of the recognized health burden from drinking waters is driven by legionellae, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and, to a lesser extent, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

26099583,Toxicity and SidJ-Mediated Suppression of Toxicity Require Distinct Regions in the SidE Family of Legionella pneumophila Effectors.,"Intracellular bacteria use a variety of strategies to evade degradation and create a replicative niche. Legionella pneumophila is an intravacuolar pathogen that establishes a replicative niche through the secretion of more than 300 effector proteins. The function of most effectors remains to be determined. Toxicity in yeast has been used to identify functional domains and elucidate the biochemical function of effectors. A library of L. pneumophila effectors was screened using an expression plasmid that produces low levels of each protein. This screen identified the effector SdeA as a protein that confers a strong toxic phenotype that inhibits yeast replication. The toxicity of SdeA was suppressed in cells producing the effector SidJ. The effector SdeA is a member of the SidE family of L. pneumophila effector proteins. All SidE orthologs encoded by the Philadelphia isolate of Legionella pneumophila were toxic to yeast, and SidJ suppressed the toxicity of each. We identified a conserved central region in the SidE proteins that was sufficient to mediate yeast toxicity. Surprisingly, SidJ did not suppress toxicity when this central region was produced in yeast. We determined that the amino-terminal region of SidE was essential for SidJ-mediated suppression of toxicity. Thus, there is a genetic interaction that links the activity of SidJ and the amino-terminal region of SidE, which is required to modulate the toxic activity displayed by the central region of the SidE protein. This suggests a complex mechanism by which the L. pneumophila effector SidJ modulates the function of the SidE proteins after translocation into host cells.","['Havey JC', 'Roy CR']",2015,83,9,Infect Immun,Havey JC and Roy CR.

26099580,Endoplasmic Reticulum Tubule Protein Reticulon 4 Associates with the Legionella pneumophila Vacuole and with Translocated Substrate Ceg9.,"Intracellular growth of Legionella pneumophila occurs in a replication vacuole constructed by host proteins that regulate vesicular traffic from the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This process is promoted by a combination of approximately 300 Icm/Dot translocated substrates (IDTS). One of these proteins, Ceg9, was previously identified in a screen for L. pneumophila IDTS that manipulate secretory traffic when overexpressed in yeast. Using ectopic expression of Ceg9 in mammalian cells, we demonstrate that Ceg9 interacts with isoforms of host reticulon 4 (Rtn4), a protein that regulates ER tubule formation. Binding occurs under conditions that prevent association with other known reticulon binding proteins, arguing that Ceg9 binding is stable. A tripartite complex was demonstrated among Rtn4, Ceg9, and atlastin 1, a previously characterized reticulon interacting partner. The binding of Ceg9 to Rtn4 was not due to bridging by atlastin 1 but resulted from the two interacting partners binding independently to reticulon. When Ceg9 is ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, it shows a localization pattern that is indistinguishable from that of Rtn4, perhaps due to interactions between and similar structural features of the two proteins. Consistent with Rtn4 playing a role in the formation of the Legionella-containing vacuole, it was recruited to almost 50% of the vacuoles within 20 min postinfection. Our studies suggest that L. pneumophila proteins interact with ER tubules at an early stage of replication vacuole formation.","['Haenssler E', 'Ramabhadran V', 'Murphy CS', 'Heidtman MI', 'Isberg RR']",2015,83,9,Infect Immun,"Haenssler E, et al.

26097034,The Tetracycline Destructases: A Novel Family of Tetracycline-Inactivating Enzymes.,"Enzymes capable of inactivating tetracycline are paradoxically rare compared with enzymes that inactivate other natural-product antibiotics. We describe a family of flavoenzymes, previously unrecognizable as resistance genes, which are capable of degrading tetracycline antibiotics. From soil functional metagenomic selections, we discovered nine genes that confer high-level tetracycline resistance by enzymatic inactivation. We also demonstrate that a tenth enzyme, an uncharacterized homolog in the human pathogen Legionella longbeachae, similarly inactivates tetracycline. These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of tetracyclines in vitro both by known mechanisms and via previously undescribed activity. Tetracycline-inactivation genes were identified in diverse soil types, encompass substantial sequence diversity, and are adjacent to genes implicated in horizontal gene transfer. Because tetracycline inactivation is scarcely observed in hospitals, these enzymes may fill an empty niche in pathogenic organisms, and should therefore be monitored for their dissemination potential into the clinic.","['Forsberg KJ', 'Patel S', 'Wencewicz TA', 'Dantas G']",2015,22,7,Chem Biol,"Forsberg KJ, et al.

26092030,Comparison of Sofia Legionella FIA and BinaxNOW® Legionella urinary antigen card in two national reference centers.,"The Sofia Legionella Fluorescence Immunoassay (FIA; Quidel) is a recently introduced rapid immunochromatographic diagnostic test for Legionnaires' disease using immunofluorescence technology designed to enhance its sensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate its performance for the detection of urinary antigens for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 in two National Reference Centers for Legionella. The sensitivity and specificity of the Sofia Legionella FIA test were determined in concentrated and nonconcentrated urine samples, before and after boiling, in comparison with the BinaxNOW® Legionella Urinary Antigen Card (UAC; Alere). Compared with BinaxNOW® Legionella UAC, the sensitivity of the Sofia Legionella test was slightly higher in nonconcentrated urine samples and was identical in concentrated urine samples. The specificity of the Sofia Legionella FIA test was highly reduced by the concentration of urine samples. In nonconcentrated samples, a lack of specificity was observed in 2.3 % of samples, all of them resolved by heat treatment. The Sofia Legionella FIA is a sensitive test for detecting Legionella urinary antigens with no previous urine concentration. However, all positive samples have to be re-tested after boiling to reach a high specificity. The reading is automatized on the Sofia analyzer, which can be connected to laboratory information systems, facilitating accurate and rapid reporting of results.","['Beraud L', 'Gervasoni K', 'Freydiere AM', 'Descours G', 'Ranc AG', 'Vandenesch F', 'Lina G', 'Gaia V', 'Jarraud S']",2015,34,9,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Beraud L, et al.

26082896,Purification and proteomics of pathogen-modified vacuoles and membranes.,"Certain pathogenic bacteria adopt an intracellular lifestyle and proliferate in eukaryotic host cells. The intracellular niche protects the bacteria from cellular and humoral components of the mammalian immune system, and at the same time, allows the bacteria to gain access to otherwise restricted nutrient sources. Yet, intracellular protection and access to nutrients comes with a price, i.e., the bacteria need to overcome cell-autonomous defense mechanisms, such as the bactericidal endocytic pathway. While a few bacteria rupture the early phagosome and escape into the host cytoplasm, most intracellular pathogens form a distinct, degradation-resistant and replication-permissive membranous compartment. Intracellular bacteria that form unique pathogen vacuoles include Legionella, Mycobacterium, Chlamydia, Simkania, and Salmonella species. In order to understand the formation of these pathogen niches on a global scale and in a comprehensive and quantitative manner, an inventory of compartment-associated host factors is required. To this end, the intact pathogen compartments need to be isolated, purified and biochemically characterized. Here, we review recent progress on the isolation and purification of pathogen-modified vacuoles and membranes, as well as their proteomic characterization by mass spectrometry and different validation approaches. These studies provide the basis for further investigations on the specific mechanisms of pathogen-driven compartment formation.","['Herweg JA', 'Hansmeier N', 'Otto A', 'Geffken AC', 'Subbarayal P', 'Prusty BK', 'Becher D', 'Hensel M', 'Schaible UE', 'Rudel T', 'Hilbi H']",2015,5,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Herweg JA, et al.

26072020,Pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial diversity in dental unit waterlines.,"Some infections cases due to exposure to output water from dental unit waterlines (DUWL) have been reported in the literature. However, this type of healthcare-associated risk has remained unclear and up until now the overall bacterial composition of DUWL has been poorly documented. In this study, 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing was used to investigate the bacterial community in seven dental offices (N = 7) and to identify potential bacterial pathogenic sequences. Dental unit waters (DUW) were collected from the tap water supplying units (Incoming Water; IW) to the output exposure point of the turbine handpiece (Output water; OW) following a stagnation period (OWS), and immediately after the last patient of the sampling day (OWA). A high bacterial diversity was revealed in DUW with 394 operational taxonomic units detected at the genus level. In addition to the inter-unit variability observed, results showed increased total bacterial cell concentration and shifts in bacterial community composition and abundance at the genus level, mainly within the Gamma- and Alpha-Proteobacteria class, as water circulated in the dental unit (DU). Results showed that 96.7%, 96.8% and 97.4% of the total sequences from IW, OWS and OWA respectively were common to the 3 defined water groups, thereby highlighting a common core microbiome. Results also suggested that stagnation and DU maintenance practices were critical to composition of the bacterial community. The presence of potentially pathogenic genera was detected, including Pseudomonas and Legionella spp. Emerging and opportunistic pathogenic genera such as Mycobacterium, Propionibacterium and Stenotrophomonas were likewise recovered in DUW. For the first time, an exhaustive evaluation of the bacterial communities present in DUW was performed taking into account the circulation of water within the DU. This study highlights an ignored diversity of the DUWL bacterial community. Our findings also contribute to a better appreciation of the potential infectious risk associated with dental care and suggest the importance of better managing microbial quality in DUW.","['Costa D', 'Mercier A', 'Gravouil K', 'Lesobre J', 'Delafont V', 'Bousseau A', 'Verdon J', 'Imbert C']",2015,81,,Water Res,"Costa D, et al.

26067986,"Structure of the Legionella Virulence Factor, SidC Reveals a Unique PI(4)P-Specific Binding Domain Essential for Its Targeting to the Bacterial Phagosome.","The opportunistic intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. L. pneumophila delivers nearly 300 effector proteins into host cells for the establishment of a replication-permissive compartment known as the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). SidC and its paralog SdcA are two effectors that have been shown to anchor on the LCV via binding to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] to facilitate the recruitment of ER proteins to the LCV. We recently reported that the N-terminal SNL (SidC N-terminal E3 Ligase) domain of SidC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, and its activity is required for the recruitment of ER proteins to the LCV. Here we report the crystal structure of SidC (1-871). The structure reveals that SidC contains four domains that are packed into an arch-like shape. The P4C domain (PI(4)P binding of SidC) comprises a four α-helix bundle and covers the ubiquitin ligase catalytic site of the SNL domain. Strikingly, a pocket with characteristic positive electrostatic potentials is formed at one end of this bundle. Liposome binding assays of the P4C domain further identified the determinants of phosphoinositide recognition and membrane interaction. Interestingly, we also found that binding with PI(4)P stimulates the E3 ligase activity, presumably due to a conformational switch induced by PI(4)P from a closed form to an open active form. Mutations of key residues involved in PI(4)P binding significantly reduced the association of SidC with the LCV and abolished its activity in the recruitment of ER proteins and ubiquitin signals, highlighting that PI(4)P-mediated targeting of SidC is critical to its function in the remodeling of the bacterial phagosome membrane. Finally, a GFP-fusion with the P4C domain was demonstrated to be specifically localized to PI(4)P-enriched compartments in mammalian cells. This domain shows the potential to be developed into a sensitive and accurate PI(4)P probe in living cells.","['Luo X', 'Wasilko DJ', 'Liu Y', 'Sun J', 'Wu X', 'Luo ZQ', 'Mao Y']",2015,11,6,PLoS Pathog,"Luo X, et al.

26066310,Relationship between Organic Carbon and Opportunistic Pathogens in Simulated Glass Water Heaters.,"Controlling organic carbon levels in municipal water has been hypothesized to limit downstream growth of bacteria and opportunistic pathogens in premise plumbing (OPPPs). Here, the relationships between influent organic carbon (0-15,000 µg ozonated fulvic acid /L) and the number of total bacteria [16S rRNA genes and heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs)] and a wide range of OPPPs (gene copy numbers of Acanthamoeba polyphaga, Vermamoeba vermiformis, Legionella pneumophila, and Mycobacterium avium) were examined in the bulk water of 120-mL simulated glass water heaters (SGWHs). The SGWHs were operated at 32-37 °C, which is representative of conditions encountered at the bottom of electric water heaters, with water changes of 80% three times per week to simulate low use. This design presented advantages of controlled and replicated (triplicate) conditions and avoided other potential limitations to OPPP growth in order to isolate the variable of organic carbon. Over seventeen months, strong correlations were observed between total organic carbon (TOC) and both 16S rRNA gene copy numbers and HPC counts (avg. R2 > 0.89). Although M. avium gene copies were occasionally correlated with TOC (avg. R2 = 0.82 to 0.97, for 2 out of 4 time points) and over a limited TOC range (0-1000 µg/L), no other correlations were identified between other OPPPs and added TOC. These results suggest that reducing organic carbon in distributed water is not adequate as a sole strategy for controlling OPPPs, although it may have promise in conjunction with other approaches.","['Williams K', 'Pruden A', 'Falkinham JO', 'Edwards M', 'Williams K', 'Pruden A', 'Falkinham JO', 'Edwards M']",2015,4,2,Pathogens,"Williams K, et al.

26060275,"csrR, a Paralog and Direct Target of CsrA, Promotes Legionella pneumophila Resilience in Water.","UNLABELLED: Critical to microbial versatility is the capacity to express the cohort of genes that increase fitness in different environments. Legionella pneumophila occupies extensive ecological space that includes diverse protists, pond water, engineered water systems, and mammalian lung macrophages. One mechanism that equips this opportunistic pathogen to adapt to fluctuating conditions is a switch between replicative and transmissive cell types that is controlled by the broadly conserved regulatory protein CsrA. A striking feature of the legionellae surveyed is that each of 14 strains encodes 4 to 7 csrA-like genes, candidate regulators of distinct fitness traits. Here we focus on the one csrA paralog (lpg1593) that, like the canonical csrA, is conserved in all 14 strains surveyed. Phenotypic analysis revealed that long-term survival in tap water is promoted by the lpg1593 locus, which we name csrR (for ""CsrA-similar protein for resilience""). As predicted by its GGA motif, csrR mRNA was bound directly by the canonical CsrA protein, as judged by electromobility shift and RNA-footprinting assays. Furthermore, CsrA repressed translation of csrR mRNA in vivo, as determined by analysis of csrR-gfp reporters, csrR mRNA stability in the presence and absence of csrA expression, and mutation of the CsrA binding site identified on the csrR mRNA. Thus, CsrA not only governs the transition from replication to transmission but also represses translation of its paralog csrR when nutrients are available. We propose that, during prolonged starvation, relief of CsrA repression permits CsrR protein to coordinate L. pneumophila's switch to a cell type that is resilient in water supplies.
IMPORTANCE: Persistence of L. pneumophila in water systems is a public health risk, and yet there is little understanding of the genetic determinants that equip this opportunistic pathogen to adapt to and survive in natural or engineered water systems. A potent regulator of this pathogen's intracellular life cycle is CsrA, a protein widely distributed among bacterial species that is understood quite well. Our finding that every sequenced L. pneumophila strain carries several csrA paralogs-including two common to all isolates--indicates that the legionellae exploit CsrA regulatory switches for multiple purposes. Our discovery that one paralog, CsrR, is a target of CsrA that enhances survival in water is an important step toward understanding colonization of the engineered environment by pathogenic L. pneumophila.","['Abbott ZD', 'Yakhnin H', 'Babitzke P', 'Swanson MS']",2015,6,3,mBio,"Abbott ZD, et al. csrR, a Paralog and Direct Target of CsrA, Promotes Legionella pneumophila Resilience in Water. csrR, a Paralog and Direct Target of CsrA, Promotes Legionella pneumophila Resilience in Water. 2015; 6:e00595. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00595-15",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26060275/
26059316,Creating a customized intracellular niche: subversion of host cell signaling by Legionella type IV secretion system effectors.,"The Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila infects a wide range of different protozoa in the environment and also human alveolar macrophages upon inhalation of contaminated aerosols. Inside its hosts, it creates a defined and unique compartment, termed the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), for survival and replication. To establish the LCV, L. pneumophila uses its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to translocate more than 300 effector proteins into the host cell. Although it has become apparent in the past years that these effectors subvert a multitude of cellular processes and allow Legionella to take control of host cell vesicle trafficking, transcription, and translation, the exact function of the vast majority of effectors still remains unknown. This is partly due to high functional redundancy among the effectors, which renders conventional genetic approaches to elucidate their role ineffective. Here, we review the current knowledge about Legionella T4SS effectors, highlight open questions, and discuss new methods that promise to facilitate the characterization of T4SS effector functions in the future.","['So EC', 'Mattheis C', 'Tate EW', 'Frankel G', 'Schroeder GN']",2015,61,9,Can J Microbiol,"So EC, et al.

Many intracellular bacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, induce type I IFNs following phagosomal membrane perturbations. Cytosolic M. tuberculosis DNA has been implicated as a trigger for IFN production, but the mechanisms remain obscure. We report that the cytosolic DNA sensor, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), is required for activating IFN production via the STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway during M. tuberculosis and L. pneumophila infection of macrophages, whereas L. monocytogenes short-circuits this pathway by producing the STING agonist, c-di-AMP. Upon sensing cytosolic DNA, cGAS also activates cell-intrinsic antibacterial defenses, promoting autophagic targeting of M. tuberculosis. Importantly, we show that cGAS binds M. tuberculosis DNA during infection, providing direct evidence that this unique host-pathogen interaction occurs in vivo. These data uncover a mechanism by which IFN is likely elicited during active human infections.","['Watson RO', 'Bell SL', 'MacDuff DA', 'Kimmey JM', 'Diner EJ', 'Olivas J', 'Vance RE', 'Stallings CL', 'Virgin HW', 'Cox JS']",2015,17,6,Cell Host Microbe,"Watson RO, et al.

FLA are partly resistant to biocides, especially in their cyst form. The control of V. vermiformis in hot water networks represents an important health issue, but there are very few data on their resistance to disinfection treatments. The sensitivity of cysts of two strains of V. vermiformis to three disinfectants frequently used in hot water networks (chlorine, heat shock, peracetic acid (PAA) mixed with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)) was investigated. In vitro, several concentrations of biocides, temperatures and exposure times according to the French regulation were tested. Cysts were fully inactivated by the following conditions: 15 mg/L of chlorine for 10 min; 60 °C for 30 min; and 0.5 g/L equivalent H2O2 of PAA mixed with H2O2 for 30 min. For the first time, the strong efficacy of subtilisin (0.625 U/mL for 24 h), a protease, to inactivate the V. vermiformis cysts has been demonstrated. It suggests that novel approaches may be efficient for disinfection processes.

Among the proteins composing the Dot/Icm system, an inner membrane protein DotI is known to be crucial for the secretion function but its structure and role in type IV secretion had not been elucidated. We report here the crystal structures of the periplasmic domains of DotI and its ortholog in the conjugation system of plasmid R64, TraM. These structures reveal a striking similarity to VirB8, a component of type IVA secretion systems, suggesting that DotI/TraM is the type IVB counterpart of VirB8. We further show that DotI and its partial paralog DotJ form a stable heterocomplex. R64 TraM, encoded by the conjugative plasmid lacking DotJ ortholog, forms a homo-hexamer. The DotI-DotJ complex is distinct from the core complex, which spans both inner and outer membranes to form a substrate conduit, and seems not to stably associate with the core complex.

The relationship between these measurements and the presence of Legionella spp. was also examined. HPC for potable and non-potable water were cultured on R2A and PCA, respectively. Results indicated a strong correlation between HPC and ATP measurements in potable water (R = 0.90, p < 0.001). In the make-up water and two cooling towers, the correlations between ATP and HPC were much weaker but statistically significant (make-up water: R = 0.37, p = 0.005; cooling tower 1: R = 0.52, p < 0.001; cooling tower 2: R = 0.54, p < 0.001). For potable and non-potable samples, HPC exhibited higher measurement variability than ATP. However, ATP measurements showed higher microbial concentrations than HPC measurements.

26034289,IL-1R signaling enables bystander cells to overcome bacterial blockade of host protein synthesis.,"The innate immune system is critical for host defense against microbial pathogens, yet many pathogens express virulence factors that impair immune function. Here, we used the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila to understand how the immune system successfully overcomes pathogen subversion mechanisms. L. pneumophila replicates within macrophages by using a type IV secretion system to translocate bacterial effectors into the host cell cytosol. As a consequence of effector delivery, host protein synthesis is blocked at several steps, including translation initiation and elongation. Despite this translation block, infected cells robustly produce proinflammatory cytokines, but the basis for this is poorly understood. By using a reporter system that specifically discriminates between infected and uninfected cells within a population, we demonstrate here that infected macrophages produced IL-1α and IL-1β, but were poor producers of IL-6, TNF, and IL-12, which are critical mediators of host protection.

26033043,Volatile organic compounds generated by cultures of bacteria and viruses associated with respiratory infections.,"Respiratory infections (RI) can be viral or bacterial in origin. In either case, the invasion of the pathogen results in production and release of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The present study examines the VOCs released from cultures of five viruses (influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus, respiratory syncitial virus and parainfluenza 1 virus), three bacteria (Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Legionella pneumophila) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolated colonies. Our results demonstrate the involvement of inflammation-induced VOCs. Two significant VOCs were identified as associated with infectious bacterial activity, heptane and methylcyclohexane. These two VOCs have been linked in previous studies to oxidative stress effects. In order to distinguish between bacterial and viral positive cultures, we performed principal component analysis including peak identity (retention time) and VOC concentration (i.e. area under the peak) revealing 1-hexanol and 1-heptadecene to be good predictors.","['Abd El Qader A', 'Lieberman D', 'Shemer Avni Y', 'Svobodin N', 'Lazarovitch T', 'Sagi O', 'Zeiri Y']",2015,29,12,Biomed Chromatogr,"Abd El Qader A, et al.

26019270,Different STAT Transcription Complexes Drive Early and Delayed Responses to Type I IFNs.,"IFNs, which transduce pivotal signals through Stat1 and Stat2, effectively suppress the replication of Legionella pneumophila in primary murine macrophages. Although the ability of IFN-γ to impede L. pneumophila growth is fully dependent on Stat1, IFN-αβ unexpectedly suppresses L. pneumophila growth in both Stat1- and Stat2-deficient macrophages. New studies demonstrating that the robust response to IFN-αβ is lost in Stat1-Stat2 double-knockout macrophages suggest that Stat1 and Stat2 are functionally redundant in their ability to direct an innate response toward L. pneumophila. Because the ability of IFN-αβ to signal through Stat1-dependent complexes (i.e., Stat1-Stat1 and Stat1-Stat2 dimers) has been well characterized, the current studies focus on how Stat2 is able to direct a potent response to IFN-αβ in the absence of Stat1. These studies reveal that IFN-αβ is able to drive the formation of a Stat2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 complex that drives the expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes, but with substantially delayed kinetics. These observations raise the possibility that this pathway evolved in response to microbes that have devised strategies to subvert Stat1-dependent responses.","['Abdul-Sater AA', 'Majoros A', 'Plumlee CR', 'Perry S', 'Gu AD', 'Lee C', 'Shresta S', 'Decker T', 'Schindler C']",2015,195,1,J Immunol,"Abdul-Sater AA, et al.

26013295,Viability-qPCR for detecting Legionella: Comparison of two assays based on different amplicon lengths.,"Two different real-time quantitative PCR (PMA-qPCR) assays were applied for quantification of Legionella spp. by targeting a long amplicon (approx 400 bp) of 16S rRNA gene and a short amplicon (approx. 100 bp) of 5S rRNA gene. Purified DNA extracts from pure cultures of Legionella spp. and from environmental water samples were quantified. Application of the two assays to quantify Legionella in artificially contaminated water achieved that both assays were able to detect Legionella over a linear range of 10 to 10(5) cells ml(-1). A statistical analysis of the standard curves showed that both assays were linear with a good correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.99) between the Ct and the copy number. Amplification with the reference assay was the most effective for detecting low copy numbers (1 bacterium per PCR mixture). Using selective quantification of viable Legionella by the PMA-qPCR method we obtained a greater inhibition of the amplification of the 400-bp 16S gene fragment (Δlog(10) = 3.74 ± 0.39 log(10) GU ml(-1)). A complete inhibition of the PCR signal was obtained when heat-killed cells in a concentration below 1 × 10(5) cells ml(-1) were pretreated with PMA. Analysing short amplicon sizes led to only 2.08 log reductions in the Legionella dead-cell signal. When we tested environmental water samples, the two qPCR assays were in good agreement according to the kappa index (0.741). Applying qPCR combined with PMA treatment, we also obtained a good agreement (kappa index 0.615). The comparison of quantitative results shows that both assays yielded the same quantification sensitivity (mean log = 4.59 vs mean log = 4.31).","['Ditommaso S', 'Giacomuzzi M', 'Ricciardi E', 'Zotti CM']",2015,29,4,Mol Cell Probes,"Ditommaso S, et al.

It remains an open question whether these sRNAs all indeed play regulatory roles, but their identification led to an exponential increase in studies searching for their function. This allowed to show that sRNAs may modulate virulence gene expression, cellular differentiation, metabolic functions, adaptation to environmental conditions and pathogenesis. In this review we will provide mechanistic insights into how sRNAs bind mRNAs and/or proteins. Furthermore, the important roles of the RNA chaperone Hfq, the CsrA system and the CRISPR RNA will be discussed. We will then focus on sRNAs and 5(') untranslated region (UTR) elements of intracellular bacteria like Chlamydia, Listeria, Legionella, or Salmonella, and place emphasis on those that are expressed during replication in host cells and are implicated in virulence and metabolism. In addition, sRNAs that regulate motility, iron homeostasis, and differentiation or stress responses will be highlighted. Taken together sRNAs constitute key elements in many major regulatory networks governing the intracellular life and virulence of pathogenic bacteria.","['Oliva G', 'Sahr T', 'Buchrieser C']",2015,39,3,FEMS Microbiol Rev,"Oliva G, et al.

25999129,"Population structure of Legionella spp. from environmental samples in Gabon, 2013.","Aquatic environments are the most important source for Legionella spp. infections such as Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever. The reservoirs of Legionella spp. are mostly unclear in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study, conducted in 2013, was to identify geographical areas of an increased risk for exposure to Legionella spp., and to describe the population structure of Legionella spp. from different water sources in a cross-sectional study in Gabon. Fresh water samples (n = 200) were cultured on Legionella selective agar; species were confirmed by MALDI-TOF, a Legionella pneumophila specific real-time PCR and 16S RNA gene sequencing. Serogroups were identified by agglutination test. The population structure was assessed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Legionella spp. isolates (n = 29) were frequently found in the hospital setting particularly in hot water systems. Open water bodies (i.e. rivers, lakes) were not contaminated with Legionella spp. Isolated L. pneumophila mainly belonged to serogroups 2-14 (n = 19) and MLST sequence type ST1, ST75 (and related STs) and ST1911. In conclusion, hospitalized patients might have an increased risk to become infected with Legionella spp. in the studied areas in Gabon, particularly if they have risk factors such as comorbidities. Both broadly extended (ST1, ST75) and local lineages (ST1911) were present in our setting.","['Ehrhardt J', 'Alabi AS', 'Kuczius T', 'Tsombeng FF', 'Becker K', 'Kremsner PG', 'Schaumburg F', 'Esen M']",2015,33,,Infect Genet Evol,"Ehrhardt J, et al.

When incubated in tap water at 4 °C, 25 °C, and 32 °C, L. pneumophila survival trends varied amongst the temperatures, with the stable populations maintained for months at 25 °C and 32 °C demonstrating that survival is possible at these temperatures for extended periods in oligotrophic conditions. After inoculating coupons of PVC, copper, brass, and cast iron, L. pneumophila colonized biofilms formed on each within days to a similar extent, with the exception of cast iron, which contained 1-log less Legionella after 90 days. L. pneumophila spiked in a model drinking water distribution system colonized the system within days. Chlorination of the system had a greater effect on biofilm-associated Legionella concentrations, with populations returning to pre-chlorination levels within six weeks. Biofilms sampled from drinking water meters collected from two areas within central Arizona were analyzed via PCR for the presence of Legionella. Occurrence in only one area indicates that environmental differences in water distribution systems may have an impact on the survival of Legionella. These results document the impact of different environmental conditions on the survival of Legionella in water.","['Schwake DO', 'Alum A', 'Abbaszadegan M']",2015,4,2,Pathogens,"Schwake DO, et al.

A series of N-benzyl-substituted 3'-(R)-3'-aminomethyl-3'-hydroxy spectinomycins was developed on the basis of a computational analysis of the aminomethyl spectinomycin binding site and structure-guided synthesis. These compounds had ribosomal inhibition values comparable to spectinomycin but showed increased potency against the common respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as the sexually transmitted bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Non-ribosome-binding 3'-(S) isomers of the lead compounds demonstrated weak inhibitory activity in in vitro protein translation assays and poor antibacterial activity, indicating that the antibacterial activity of the series remains on target against the ribosome. Compounds also demonstrated no mammalian cytotoxicity, improved microsomal stability, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in rats. The lead compound from the series exhibited excellent chemical stability superior to spectinomycin; no interaction with a panel of human receptors and drug metabolism enzymes, suggesting low potential for adverse reactions or drug-drug interactions in vivo; activity in vitro against a panel of penicillin-, macrolide-, and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae clinical isolates; and the ability to cure mice of fatal pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis at a dose of 5 mg/kg.

25980749,"Viral and atypical bacterial aetiologies of infection in hospitalised patients admitted with clinical suspicion of influenza in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Influenza constitutes a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is limited information about the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in hospitalised adults and children in South-East Asia. Such data are important for future management of respiratory infections.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the aetiology of infection presenting clinically as influenza in those hospitalised in South-East Asia.
METHODS: Respiratory specimens archived from July 2008 to June 2009 from patients hospitalised with suspected influenza from Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were tested for respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria by polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: A total of 1222 patients' samples were tested. Of 1222, 776 patients (63·5%) were under the age of 5. Viruses detected included rhinoviruses in 229 of 1222 patients (18·7%), bocaviruses in 200 (16·4%), respiratory syncytial viruses in 144 (11·8%), parainfluenza viruses in 140 (11·5%; PIV1: 32; PIV2: 12; PIV3: 71; PIV4: 25), adenovirus in 102 (8·4%), influenza viruses in 93 (7·6%; influenza A: 77; influenza B: 16) and coronaviruses in 23 (1·8%; OC43: 14; E229: 9). Bacterial pathogens were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 33, 2·7%), Chlamydophila psittaci (n = 2), C. pneumoniae (n = 1), Bordetella pertussis (n = 1) and Legionella pneumophila (n = 2). Overall, in-hospital case fatality rate was 29 of 1222 (2·4%).
CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were the most commonly detected pathogens in patients hospitalised with a clinical suspicion of influenza. Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected virus, and M. pneumoniae, the most common atypical bacterium. The low number of detected influenza viruses demonstrates a low benefit for empirical oseltamivir therapy, unless during an influenza outbreak.","['Wertheim HFL', 'Nadjm B', 'Thomas S', 'Agustiningsih', 'Malik S', 'Nguyen DNT', 'Vu DVT', 'Van Nguyen K', 'Van Nguyen CV', 'Nguyen LT', 'Tran ST', 'Phung TBT', 'Nguyen TV', 'Hien TT', 'Nguyen UH', 'Taylor W', 'Truong KH', 'Ha TM', 'Chokephaibulkit K', 'Farrar J', 'Wolbers M', 'de Jong MD', 'van Doorn HR', 'Puthavathana P']",2015,9,6,Influenza Other Respir Viruses,"Wertheim HFL, et al.

25956886,A sulfur-based transport pathway in Cu+-ATPases.,"Cells regulate copper levels tightly to balance the biogenesis and integrity of copper centers in vital enzymes against toxic levels of copper. PIB -type Cu(+)-ATPases play a central role in copper homeostasis by catalyzing the selective translocation of Cu(+) across cellular membranes. Crystal structures of a copper-free Cu(+)-ATPase are available, but the mechanism of Cu(+) recognition, binding, and translocation remains elusive. Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, ATPase activity assays, and charge transfer measurements on solid-supported membranes using wild-type and mutant forms of the Legionella pneumophila Cu(+)-ATPase (LpCopA), we identify a sulfur-lined metal transport pathway. Structural analysis indicates that Cu(+) is bound at a high-affinity transmembrane-binding site in a trigonal-planar coordination with the Cys residues of the conserved CPC motif of transmembrane segment 4 (C382 and C384) and the conserved Met residue of transmembrane segment 6 (M717 of the MXXXS motif). These residues are also essential for transport. Additionally, the studies indicate essential roles of other conserved intramembranous polar residues in facilitating copper binding to the high-affinity site and subsequent release through the exit pathway.","['Mattle D', 'Zhang L', 'Sitsel O', 'Pedersen LT', 'Moncelli MR', 'Tadini-Buoninsegni F', 'Gourdon P', 'Rees DC', 'Nissen P', 'Meloni G']",2015,16,6,EMBO Rep,"Mattle D, et al.

A wide variation in the survival of L. pneumophila was observed when incubated in different washer fluids at 25 and 37 °C, however, one brand tested supported Legionella survival similar to or greater than sterilized deionized water. In addition, 1 L of tap water contained in a washer fluid reservoir was able to support population growth and survival of Legionella for several months. In a field study examining the windshield washer fluid of 12 elementary school buses, Legionella were detected from 84% of samples at a high concentration of 8.1×10(4) CFU/mL. Culturable cells were also detected in aerosolized washer fluid during washer fluid spray.

LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry was established using the LIVE/DEAD(®) BacLight™ Bacterial Viability Kit with different ratios of Legionella pneumophila and Escherichia coli cells with intact and compromised membranes (heat treated). The PMA-qPCR method was tested and modified, and results were compared with those from LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry using L. pneumophila cells. Ratios of membrane intact to membrane compromised cells were well shown by LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry in all combinations. PMA-qPCR seems to work best in even mixed ratios (1:1) of intact and compromised cells. In other respects, we noticed an overestimation of intact cells in the samples which contained a high percentage of membrane compromised cells, and an underestimation of intact cells in samples with a small percentage of membrane compromised cells. However, looking at total counts instead of ratios, the results were within an order of magnitude. This implies that the use of PMA-qPCR is appropriate only for a qualitative analysis to monitor the success of a process such as disinfection. Furthermore, we were able to assess that both methods have advantages and disadvantages: LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry as applied in this study works well on some bacteria monocultures, but does not distinguish between bacteria species. The PMA-qPCR method allows the possibility of distinguishing between membrane intact cells and membrane compromised cells and can be used to screen for specific bacteria.","['Zacharias N', 'Kistemann T', 'Schreiber C']",2015,218,8,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Zacharias N, et al.

25935681,Rapid and specific SPRi detection of L. pneumophila in complex environmental water samples.,"Legionellosis is a very devastating disease worldwide mainly due to unpredictable outbreaks in man-made water systems. Developing a highly specific and sensitive rapid detection system that detects only metabolically active bacteria is a main priority for water quality assessment. We previously developed a versatile technique for sensitive and specific detection of synthetic RNA. In the present work, we further investigated the performance of the developed biosensor for detection of Legionella pneumophila in complex environmental samples, particularly those containing protozoa. The specificity and sensitivity of the detection system were verified using total RNA extracted from L. pneumophila in spiked water co-cultured with amoebae. We demonstrated that the expression level of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is extremely dependent on the environmental conditions. The presence of amoebae with L. pneumophila, especially in nutrition-deprived samples, increased the amount of L. pneumophila 15-fold after 1 week as measured through the expression of 16s rRNA. Using the developed surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) detection method, we were also able to successfully detect L. pneumophila within 3 h, both in the presence and absence of amoebae in the complex environmental samples obtained from a cooling water tower. These findings suggest that the developed biosensing system is a viable method for rapid, real-time and effective detection not only for L. pneumophila in environmental samples but also to assess the risk associated with the use of water contaminated with other pathogens.","['Foudeh AM', 'Trigui H', 'Mendis N', 'Faucher SP', 'Veres T', 'Tabrizian M']",2015,407,18,Anal Bioanal Chem,"Foudeh AM, et al.

25926494,Microbiological and Clinical Studies of Legionellosis in 33 Patients with Cancer.,"Legionella, a large group of environmental Gram-negative bacteria, represents an occasional cause of pneumonia. We analyzed the microbiological and clinical features of 33 consecutive cases of Legionella infections that occurred at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, from 2002 to 2014. The Legionella strains were isolated from bronchoscopy specimens (32 strains) and a blood culture (1 strain) and were identified by sequencing analysis of the full-length 16S rRNA gene. The 33 strains involved 12 Legionella species or subspecies: 15 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. pneumophila, 3 strains of L. pneumophila subsp. fraseri or L. pneumophila subsp. pascullei, 4 strains of ""L. donaldsonii,"" 3 strains of L. micdadei, and one each of L. bozemanae, L. feeleii, L. gormanii, L. longbeachae, L. maceachernii, L. parisiensis, L. sainthelensi, and Legionella sp. strain D5382. All patients except one asymptomatic carrier showed pneumonia, including one with concurrent bacteremia. Nine patients died, with this infection being the immediate cause of death in six. Twenty-seven patients had underlying hematologic malignancies. Twenty-three patients were leukopenic. Six patients were recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with their infections caused by five Legionella species. Together, these results suggest that diverse Legionella species infect patients with cancer in the Houston area and its vicinity. The five cases of pneumonia due to L. donaldsonii and Legionella sp. D5382 are likely the first reports of human infection with these organisms.","['Han XY', 'Ihegword A', 'Evans SE', 'Zhang J', 'Li L', 'Cao H', 'Tarrand JJ', 'El-Kweifi O']",2015,53,7,J Clin Microbiol,"Han XY, et al.

25921720,Bacterial community structure in treated sewage sludge with mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion.,"Stabilized sewage sludge is applied to agricultural fields and farmland due to its high organic matter content. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two types of sludge stabilization, mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD), on bacterial communities in sludge, including the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. Bacterial community structure and phylogenetic diversity were analyzed in four sewage sludge samples from the Czech Republic. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes showed that investigated sludge samples harbor diverse bacterial populations with only a few taxa present across all samples. Bacterial diversity was higher in sludge samples after MAD versus TAD treatment, and communities in MAD-treated sludge shared the highest genetic similarities. In all samples, the bacterial community was dominated by reads affiliated with Proteobacteria. The sludge after TAD treatment had considerably higher number of reads of thermotolerant/thermophilic taxa, such as the phyla Deinococcus-Thermus and Thermotogae or the genus Coprothermobacter. Only one operational taxonomic unit (OTU), which clustered with Rhodanobacter, was detected in all communities at a relative abundance >1 %. All of the communities were screened for the presence of 16S rRNA gene sequences of pathogenic bacteria using a database of 122 pathogenic species and ≥98 % identity threshold. The abundance of such sequences ranged between 0.23 and 1.57 % of the total community, with lower numbers present after the TAD treatment, indicating its higher hygienization efficiency. Sequences clustering with nontuberculous mycobacteria were present in all samples. Other detected sequences of pathogenic bacteria included Streptomyces somaliensis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Alcaligenes faecalis, Gordonia spp., Legionella anisa, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Brucella melitensis, and Staphylococcus aureus.","['Stiborova H', 'Wolfram J', 'Demnerova K', 'Macek T', 'Uhlik O']",2015,60,6,Folia Microbiol (Praha),"Stiborova H, et al.

For the period 2001-2012, the estimated cost of hospital admissions for nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, the majority caused by M. avium, was almost $1 billion. These three waterborne opportunistic pathogens are normal inhabitants of drinking water--not contaminants--that share a number of key characteristics that predispose them to survival, persistence, and growth in drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing. Herein, I list and describe these shared characteristics that include: disinfectant-resistance, biofilm-formation, growth in amoebae, growth at low organic carbon concentrations (oligotrophic), and growth under conditions of stagnation.

25914647,Macropinocytosis: a pathway to protozoan infection.,"Among the various endocytic mechanisms in mammalian cells, macropinocytosis involves internalization of large amounts of plasma membrane together with extracellular medium, leading to macropinosome formation. These structures are formed when plasma membrane ruffles are assembled after actin filament rearrangement. In dendritic cells, macropinocytosis has been reported to play a role in antigen presentation. Several intracellular pathogens are internalized by host cells via multiple endocytic pathways and macropinocytosis has been described as an important entry site for various organisms. Some bacteria, such as Legionella pneumophila, as well as various viruses, use this pathway to penetrate and subvert host cells. Some protozoa, which are larger than bacteria and virus, can also use this pathway to invade host cells. As macropinocytosis is characterized by the formation of large uncoated vacuoles and is triggered by various signaling pathways, which is similar to what occurs during the formation of the majority of parasitophorous vacuoles, it is believed that this phenomenon may be more widely used by parasites than is currently appreciated. Here we review protozoa host cell invasion via macropinocytosis.","['de Carvalho TM', 'Barrias ES', 'de Souza W']",2015,6,,Front Physiol,"de Carvalho TM, et al.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional international anonymous survey among a convenience sample of critical care, pulmonary, emergency and internal medicine physicians from Brazil between October and December 2008. The electronic survey evaluated physicians' attitudes towards the diagnosis, risk assessment and therapeutic interventions for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.
RESULTS: A total of 253 physicians responded to the survey, with 66% from Southeast Brazil. The majority (60%) of the responding physicians had > 10 years of medical experience. The risk assessment of severe community-acquired pneumonia was very heterogeneous, with clinical evaluation as the most frequent approach. Although blood cultures were recognized as exhibiting a poor diagnostic performance, these cultures were performed by 75% of respondents. In contrast, the presence of urinary pneumococcal and Legionella antigens was evaluated by less than 1/3 of physicians. The vast majority of physicians (95%) prescribe antibiotics according to a guideline, with the combination of a 3rd/4th generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide as the most frequent choice.
CONCLUSION: This Brazilian survey identified an important gap between guidelines and clinical practice and recommends the institution of educational programs that implement evidence-based strategies for the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia.","['Rabello L', 'Conceição C', 'Ebecken K', 'Lisboa T', 'Bozza FA', 'Soares M', 'Póvoa P', 'Salluh JI']",2015,27,1,Rev Bras Ter Intensiva,"Rabello L, et al.

25903720,Formation of a pathogen vacuole according to Legionella pneumophila: how to kill one bird with many stones.,"Legionella species are ubiquitous, waterborne bacteria that thrive in numerous ecological niches. Yet, in contrast to many other environmental bacteria, Legionella spp. are also able to grow intracellularly in predatory protozoa. This feature mainly accounts for the pathogenicity of Legionella pneumophila, which causes the majority of clinical cases of a severe pneumonia termed Legionnaires' disease. The pathomechanism underlying L. pneumophila infection is based on macrophage resistance, which in turn is largely defined by the opportunistic pathogen's resistance towards amoebae. L. pneumophila replicates in macrophages or amoebae in a unique membrane-bound compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). LCV formation requires the bacterial intracellular multiplication/defective for organelle trafficking (Icm/Dot) type IV secretion system and involves a plethora of translocated effector proteins, which subvert pivotal processes in the host cell. Of the ca. 300 different experimentally validated Icm/Dot substrates, about 50 have been studied and attributed a cellular function to date. The versatility and ingenuity of these effectors' mode of actions is striking. In this review, we summarize insight into the cellular functions and biochemical activities of well-characterized L. pneumophila effector proteins and the host pathways they target. Recent studies not only substantially increased our knowledge about pathogen-host interactions, but also shed light on novel biological mechanisms.","['Finsel I', 'Hilbi H']",2015,17,7,Cell Microbiol,Finsel I and Hilbi H.

25902991,Method modification of the Legipid® Legionella fast detection test kit.,"Legipid(®) Legionella Fast Detection is a test based on combined magnetic immunocapture and enzyme-immunoassay (CEIA) for the detection of Legionella in water. The test is based on the use of anti-Legionella antibodies immobilized on magnetic microspheres. Target microorganism is preconcentrated by filtration. Immunomagnetic analysis is applied on these preconcentrated water samples in a final test portion of 9 mL. The test kit was certified by the AOAC Research Institute as Performance Tested Method(SM) (PTM) No. 111101 in a PTM validation which certifies the performance claims of the test method in comparison to the ISO reference method 11731-1998 and the revision 11731-2004 ""Water Quality: Detection and Enumeration of Legionella pneumophila"" in potable water, industrial water, and waste water. The modification of this test kit has been approved. The modification includes increasing the target analyte from L. pneumophila to Legionella species and adding an optical reader to the test method. In this study, 71 strains of Legionella spp. other than L. pneumophila were tested to determine its reactivity with the kit based on CEIA. All the strains of Legionella spp. tested by the CEIA test were confirmed positive by reference standard method ISO 11731. This test (PTM 111101) has been modified to include a final optical reading. A methods comparison study was conducted to demonstrate the equivalence of this modification to the reference culture method. Two water matrixes were analyzed. Results show no statistically detectable difference between the test method and the reference culture method for the enumeration of Legionella spp. The relative level of detection was 93 CFU/volume examined (LOD50). For optical reading, the LOD was 40 CFU/volume examined and the LOQ was 60 CFU/volume examined.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sediment samples (87 MDWST) from eighteen locations across ten states of the United States were collected and assayed by qPCR for a range of potential enteric and opportunistic microbial pathogens and a sewage-associated Bacteroides marker. Potential opportunistic pathogens dominated, with the highest detection of occurrence (per cent positive detection; average cell equivalence (CE)) being Mycobacterium spp. (88·9%; 6·7 ± 8·5 × 10(4) CE g(-1) ), followed by Legionella spp. (66·7%; 5·2 ± 5·9 × 10(3) CE g(-1) ), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22·2%; 250 ± 880 CE g(-1) ) and Acanthamoeba spp. (38·9%; 53 ± 70 CE g(-1) ), with no detected Naegleria fowleri. Most enteric pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis) were not detected, except for a trace signal for Campylobacter spp. There was significant correlation between the qPCR signals of Legionella spp. and Acanthamoeba spp. (R(2) = 0·61, n = 87, P = 0·0001). Diverse Legionella spp. including Leg. pneumophila, Leg. pneumophila sg1 and Leg. anisa were identified, each of which might cause legionellosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that potential opportunistic pathogens are common within MDWST sediments and could act as a source of microbial contamination, but need downstream growth to be of potential concern.

25887275,Characterization of the extent of a large outbreak of Legionnaires' disease by serological assays.,"BACKGROUND: In May 2005, a long-distance outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (LD) caused by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 occurred in south-east Norway. The initial outbreak investigation without serology identified 56 laboratory-confirmed LD cases of whom 10 died. However, 116 patients with community-acquired pneumonia might belong to the outbreak based on epidemiological investigations, but acute laboratory tests other than serology were negative or not performed. To assess the true extent of the outbreak, we evaluated two serological assays in order to reclassify the 116 patients with indeterminate case status.
METHODS: Two polyvalent antibody tests, a serogroup 1-6 immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a serogroup 1-7 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used. They were evaluated with cases defined as culture- or urinary antigen positive LD patients (n=40) and non-cases defined as confirmed non-LD patients (n=39) and healthy control subjects (n=62). The 116 patients, who were negative in culture, polymerase chain reaction and/or urinary antigen tests, were analysed by the same serological assays. Antibodies to the outbreak strain were determined by immunoblotting.
RESULTS: In the evaluation study, the sensitivity and specificity of a ≥4-fold IFA titre change was 38% and 100%, respectively, with corresponding values of 30% and 99% for seroconversion in ELISA. A single high positive IFA titre yielded sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 97%, respectively, with corresponding values of 68% and 96% for a single high immunoglobulin (Ig) G and/or IgM in ELISA. Based on this evaluation, the following serological testing identified 47 more LD cases, and the outbreak thus comprised 103 cases with a case fatality rate of 10%. About the same proportion (70%) of the urinary antigen positive and negative LD cases had antibodies to the serogroup-specific lipopolysaccharide of the outbreak strain. In addition to the 103 LD cases, Legionella infection could not be verified or excluded in 32 patients based on epidemiology and/or lack of microbiological sampling.
CONCLUSIONS: The acute-phase tests (culture, polymerase chain reaction, and urinary antigen) identified less than 55% of the 103 patients in this outbreak. Serological testing thus remains an important supplement for diagnosis of LD and for determination of outbreak cases.","['Simonsen Ø', 'Wedege E', 'Kanestrøm A', 'Bolstad K', 'Aaberge IS', 'Ragnhildstveit E', 'Ringstad J']",2015,15,,BMC Infect Dis,"Simonsen Ø, et al.

We analyzed data from population-based infectious disease surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) among children <5 years of age in Kibera, a densely populated urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya.
METHODS: Surveillance was conducted among a monthly mean of 5,874 (range = 5,778-6,411) children <5 years old in two contiguous villages in Kibera. Participants had free access to the study clinic and their health events and utilization were noted during biweekly home visits. Patients meeting criteria for SARI (WHO-defined severe or very severe pneumonia, or oxygen saturation <90%) from March 1, 2007-February 28, 2011 had blood cultures processed for bacteria, and naso- and oro- pharyngeal swabs collected for quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Swabs collected during January 1, 2009 - February 28, 2010 were also tested for rhinoviruses, enterovirus, parechovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella species. Swabs were collected for simultaneous testing from a selected group of control-children visiting the clinic without recent respiratory or diarrheal illnesses.
RESULTS: SARI overall incidence was 12.4 cases/100 person-years of observation (PYO) and 30.4 cases/100 PYO in infants. When comparing detection frequency in swabs from 815 SARI cases and 115 healthy controls, only RSV and influenza A virus were significantly more frequently detected in cases, although similar trends neared statistical significance for PIV, adenovirus and hMPV. The incidence for RSV was 2.8 cases/100 PYO and for influenza A was 1.0 cases/100 PYO. When considering all PIV, the rate was 1.1 case/100 PYO and the rate per 100 PYO for SARI-associated disease was 1.5 for adenovirus and 0.9 for hMPV. RSV and influenza A and B viruses were estimated to account for 16.2% and 6.7% of SARI cases, respectively; when taken together, PIV, adenovirus, and hMPV may account for >20% additional cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Influenza viruses and RSV (and possibly PIV, hMPV and adenoviruses) are important pathogens to consider when developing technologies and formulating strategies to treat and prevent SARI in children.","['Breiman RF', 'Cosmas L', 'Njenga M', 'Williamson J', 'Mott JA', 'Katz MA', 'Erdman DD', 'Schneider E', 'Oberste M', 'Neatherlin JC', 'Njuguna H', 'Ondari DM', 'Odero K', 'Okoth GO', 'Olack B', 'Wamola N', 'Montgomery JM', 'Fields BS', 'Feikin DR']",2015,15,,BMC Infect Dis,"Breiman RF, et al.

Here, we describe the phenotypes of Dictyostelium discoideum ATG16(-) and ATG9(-)/16(-) cells and compare them to the previously reported ATG9(-) mutant. ATG16 deficiency caused an increase in the expression of several core autophagy genes, among them atg9 and the two atg8 paralogues.

Uptake of Legionella pneumophila was reduced. In addition, ATG9(-) and ATG16(-) cells had dramatic defects in autophagy, development and proteasomal activity which were much more severe in the ATG9(-)/16(-) double mutant. Mutant cells showed an increase in poly-ubiquitinated proteins and contained large ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates which partially co-localized with ATG16-GFP in ATG9(-)/16(-) cells.

25870856,Novel Cycloheximide Derivatives Targeting the Moonlighting Protein Mip Exhibit Specific Antimicrobial Activity Against Legionella pneumophila.,"Macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip) and Mip-like proteins are virulence factors in a wide range of pathogens including Legionella pneumophila. These proteins belong to the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) family of peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases (PPIases). In L. pneumophila, the PPIase activity of Mip is required for invasion of macrophages, transmigration through an in vitro lung-epithelial barrier, and full virulence in the guinea pig infection model. Additionally, Mip is a moonlighting protein that binds to collagen IV in the extracellular matrix. Here, we describe the development and synthesis of cycloheximide derivatives with adamantyl moieties as novel FKBP ligands, and analyze their effect on the viability of L. pneumophila and other bacteria. All compounds efficiently inhibited PPIase activity of the prototypic human FKBP12 as well as Mip with IC50-values as low as 180 nM and 1.7 μM, respectively. Five of these derivatives inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila at concentrations of 30-40 μM, but exhibited no effect on other tested bacterial species indicating a specific spectrum of antibacterial activity. The derivatives carrying a 3,5-dimethyladamantan-1-[yl]acetamide substitution (MT_30.32), and a 3-ethyladamantan-1-[yl]acetamide substitution (MT_30.51) had the strongest effects in PPIase- and liquid growth assays. MT_30.32 and MT_30.51 were also inhibitory in macrophage infection studies without being cytotoxic. Accordingly, by applying a combinatorial approach, we were able to generate novel, hybrid inhibitors consisting of cycloheximide and adamantane, two known FKBP inhibitors that interact with different parts of the PPIase domain, respectively. Interestingly, despite the proven Mip-inhibitory activity, the viability of a Mip-deficient strain was affected to the same degree as its wild type. Hence, we also propose that cycloheximide derivatives with adamantyl moieties are potent PPIase inhibitors with multiple targets in L. pneumophila.","['Rasch J', 'Theuerkorn M', 'Ünal C', 'Heinsohn N', 'Tran S', 'Fischer G', 'Weiwad M', 'Steinert M']",2015,3,,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,"Rasch J, et al.

Indeed, warnericin RK is highly hemolytic with a bactericidal mode of action, whereas PSMα is poorly hemolytic with a bacteriostatic mode of action toward L. pneumophila. In order to find anti-Legionella peptides which are not hemolytic, a collection of peptides varying in sequence from warnericin RK to PSMα were designed and synthesized, and their anti-Legionella activities, in terms of growth inhibition, permeabilization, and bactericidal effect, as well as their hemolytic activities, were measured and compared.

25858417,[Accreditation of a hygiene hospital laboratory for sampling and analysis activities for the detection and counting of Legionella in water].,"Since January 1(st) 2012, detection and counting of Legionella bacteria have been obligatory in France and must be carried out by COFRAC-accredited laboratories. In our establishment, sampling and analysis were outsourced and our hospital was scheduled to move to a new site. We aimed to develop both these activities in-house and to obtain COFRAC accreditation, whilst organizing the move to the new site. We set up a quality assurance system bringing together staff from the hygiene laboratory and institutional resource managers. We set up sampling and analysis activities in-house 13 months before requesting accreditation. The initial evaluation took place before we moved and identified 17 areas of deficiency, six of which were considered critical. After we had moved, a subsequent evaluation considered 14 of these deficiencies to have been corrected, included the six initially identified as critical. We were therefore awarded accreditation. The quality assurance system established during the year before our request was submitted led to accreditation two and a half years after the transfer in-house of sampling and analysis activities, despite our hospital moving during this period.","['Lecointe D', 'Noël C', 'Beauvais R', 'Descaves C', 'Gouot A', 'Bourgeois S', 'Koutcherenko S', 'Kassidi N']",2015,73,3,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),"Lecointe D, et al.

25851812,Design and validation of a qPCR assay for accurate detection and initial serogrouping of Legionella pneumophila in clinical specimens by the ESCMID Study Group for Legionella Infections (ESGLI).,"Prompt detection of Legionella pneumophila is essential for rapid investigation of legionellosis. Furthermore, as the majority of L. pneumophila infections are caused by serogroup 1 (sg1) strains, rapid identification of such strains can be critical in both routine and outbreak scenarios. The ESCMID Study Group for Legionella Infections (ESGLI) was established in 2012 and immediately identified as a priority the validation of a reliable, easy to perform and interpret, cost-effective qPCR assay to standardise the detection of L. pneumophila DNA amongst members. A novel L. pneumophila assay targeting the mip gene was designed and combined with previously published methodologies amplifying the sg1 marker (wzm) and the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) internal process control. The resulting triplex assay was validated internationally on the three qPCR platforms used by the majority of European Legionella reference laboratories: ABI 7500 (Life Technologies), LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche) and Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen). Clinical and EQA specimens were tested together with a large panel of strains (251 in total) to validate the assay. The assay proved to be 100% specific for L. pneumophila and sg1 DNA both in silico and in vitro. Efficiency values for mip and wzm assays ranged between 91.97 and 97.69%. Limit of detection values estimated with 95% confidence were adopted for mip and wzm assays on all three qPCR platforms. Inhibition was not observed. This study describes a robust assay that could be widely implemented to standardise the molecular detection of L. pneumophila among ESGLI laboratories and beyond.","['Mentasti M', 'Kese D', 'Echahidi F', 'Uldum SA', 'Afshar B', 'David S', 'Mrazek J', 'De Mendonça R', 'Harrison TG', 'Chalker VJ']",2015,34,7,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Mentasti M, et al.

25847958,Selective requirement of the shikimate pathway of Legionella pneumophila for intravacuolar growth within human macrophages but not within Acanthamoeba.,"Legionella pneumophila utilizes the Dot/Icm type IV translocation system to proliferate within a vacuole in a wide variety of natural amoebal hosts and in alveolar macrophages of the human accidental host. Although L. pneumophila utilizes host amino acids as the main sources of carbon and energy, it is not known whether de novo synthesis of amino acids by intravacuolar L. pneumophila contributes to its nutrition. The aroB and aroE genes encode enzymes for the shikimate pathway that generates the aromatic amino acids Phe, Trp, and Tyr. Here we show the aroB and aroE mutants of L. pneumophila to be defective in growth in human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) but not in Acanthamoeba spp. The aroB and aroE mutants are severely attenuated in intrapulmonary proliferation in the A/J mouse model of Legionnaires' disease, and the defect is fully complemented by the respective wild-type alleles. The two mutants grow normally in rich media but do not grow in defined media lacking aromatic amino acids, and the growth defect is rescued by inclusion of the aromatic amino acids, which are essential for production of the pyomelanin pigment. Interestingly, supplementation of infected hMDMs with the three aromatic amino acids or with Trp alone rescues the intramacrophage defect of the aroE but not the aroB mutant. Therefore, the shikimate pathway of L. pneumophila is differentially required for optimal growth within human macrophages, which are auxotrophic for Trp and Phe, but is dispensable for growth within the Acanthamoeba spp. that synthesize the aromatic amino acids.","['Jones SC', 'Price CT', 'Santic M', 'Abu Kwaik Y']",2015,83,6,Infect Immun,"Jones SC, et al.

The survival after different stressors of biofilm-associated L. pneumophila was evaluated during 150 days in this study. Mixed biofilms were allowed to develop on coupons in a biofilm reactor, which was experimentally infected with L. pneumophila. A dose of 2 ppm of monochloramine was found ineffective to kill younger (60 days) biofilm-associated L. pneumophila, whereas shock treatment (500 and 1000 ppm) was found to be significantly successful, as expected. Also, short exposure to 60 °C was insufficient to kill all young L. pneumophila within biofilms. A significant amount of young L. pneumophila bacteria also resisted pH 11 and 3 molar salt solution. No significant change was observed after exposure to 4 °C, ultra pure water and pH 5. Interestingly, L. pneumophila bacteria in biofilm became more sensitive after 90 days.","['Vatansever C', 'Türetgen I']",2015,87,3,Water Environ Res,Vatansever C and Türetgen I.

25840824,Effect of monochloramine treatment on the microbial ecology of Legionella and associated bacterial populations in a hospital hot water system.,"Opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella spp. and non-tuberculous mycobacteria, can thrive in building hot water systems despite municipal and traditional on-site chlorine disinfection. Monochloramine is a relatively new approach to on-site disinfection, but the microbiological impact of on-site chloramine use has not been well studied. We hypothesized that comparison of the microbial ecology associated with monochloramine treatment versus no on-site treatment would yield highly dissimilar bacterial communities. Hot water samples were collected monthly from 7 locations for three months from two buildings in a Pennsylvania hospital complex supplied with common municipal water: (1) a hospital administrative building (no on-site treatment) and (2) an adjacent acute-care hospital treated on-site with monochloramine to control Legionella spp. Water samples were subjected to DNA extraction, rRNA PCR, and 454 pyrosequencing. Stark differences in the microbiome of the chloraminated water and the control were observed. Bacteria in the treated samples were primarily Sphingomonadales and Limnohabitans, whereas Flexibacter and Planctomycetaceae predominated in untreated control samples. Serendipitously, one sampling month coincided with dysfunction of the on-site disinfection system that resulted in a Legionella bloom detected by sequencing and culture. This study also demonstrates the potential utility of high-throughput DNA sequencing to monitor microbial ecology in water systems.","['Baron JL', 'Harris JK', 'Holinger EP', 'Duda S', 'Stevens MJ', 'Robertson CE', 'Ross KA', 'Pace NR', 'Stout JE']",2015,38,3,Syst Appl Microbiol,"Baron JL, et al.

25836671,Comparative genomic analysis of two novel sporadic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 strains isolated 2011 in Germany.,"A large outbreak of gastrointestinal disease occurred in 2011 in Germany which resulted in almost 4000 patients with acute gastroenteritis or hemorrhagic colitis, 855 cases of a hemolytic uremic syndrome and 53 deaths. The pathogen was an uncommon, multiresistant Escherichia coli strain of serotype O104:H4 which expressed a Shiga toxin characteristic of enterohemorrhagic E. coli and in addition virulence factors common to enteroaggregative E. coli. During post-epidemic surveillance of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) all but two of O104:H4 isolates were indistinguishable from the epidemic strain. Here we describe two novel STEC O104:H4 strains isolated in close spatiotemporal proximity to the outbreak which show a virulence gene panel, a Shiga toxin-mediated cytotoxicity towards Vero cells and aggregative adherence to Hep-2 cells comparable to the outbreak strain. They differ however both from the epidemic strain and from each other, by their antibiotic resistance phenotypes and some other features as determined by routine epidemiological subtyping methods. Whole genome sequencing of these two strains, of ten outbreak strain isolates originating from different time points of the outbreak and of one historical sporadic EHEC O104:H4 isolate was performed. Sequence analysis revealed a clear phylogenetic distance between the two variant strains and the outbreak strain finally identifying them as epidemiologically unrelated isolates from sporadic cases. These findings add to the knowledge about this emerging pathogen, illustrating a certain diversity within the bacterial core genome as well as loss and gain of accessory elements. Our results do also support the view that distinct new variants of STEC O104:H4 repeatedly might originate from yet unknown reservoirs, rather than that there would be a continuous diversification of a single epidemic strain established and circulating in Germany after the large outbreak in 2011.","['Tietze E', 'Dabrowski PW', 'Prager R', 'Radonic A', 'Fruth A', 'Auraß P', 'Nitsche A', 'Mielke M', 'Flieger A']",2015,10,4,PLoS One,"Tietze E, et al.

25834717,Identification of Legionella Pneumophila in Intubated Patients With TaqMan Real Time PCR.,"BACKGROUND: Legionellaceae contains Legionella genus with over 52 species and 64 serogroups. It is one of the most important causes of respiratory disease in human. More than 30% of hospital-acquired pneumonia is caused by Legionella. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an infection acquired in hospital wards, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU). This disease approximately affects 9% to 20% of intubated patients. Mortality in these patients varies between 8% and 76%. Legionella is one of the important factors for infection in intubated patients.
OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed to investigate the use of molecular methods in diagnosis of infection caused by Legionella pneumophila.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 109 samples of lung secretions collected from intubated patients admitted to ICU wards of four university hospitals in a three-month period were examined. Cultivation and Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods were used to assess L. pneumophila colonization in these samples.
RESULTS: Eleven samples had positive results using real time PCR analysis of 16s rRNA gene fragments specific for L. pneumophila, but according to culture method on specific buffered charcoal-yeast extract medium (BCYE), no positive cases were detected. Of the total positive cases, six were males, one female and four infants. The seven adults aged 40-65 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Using molecular methods in diagnosis of infection caused by L. pneumophila has a great value because of its high specificity and rapid diagnosis potency.","['Divan Khosroshahi N', 'Naserpour Farivar T', 'Johari P']",2015,8,3,Jundishapur J Microbiol,"Divan Khosroshahi N, et al.

Phagosome maturation requires sequential fusion of the phagosome with early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes. Although various phosphoinositides (PIPs) have been detected on phagosomes, it remained unclear which PIPs actually govern phagosome maturation. Here, we analyzed the involvement of PIPs in fusion of phagosomes with various endocytic compartments and identified phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P], phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P], and the lipid kinases that generate these PIPs, as mediators of phagosome-lysosome fusion. Phagosome-early endosome fusion required PI(3)P, yet did not depend on PI(4)P. Thus, PI(3)P regulates phagosome maturation at early and late stages, whereas PI(4)P is selectively required late in the pathway.","['Jeschke A', 'Zehethofer N', 'Lindner B', 'Krupp J', 'Schwudke D', 'Haneburger I', 'Jovic M', 'Backer JM', 'Balla T', 'Hilbi H', 'Haas A']",2015,112,15,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Jeschke A, et al.

25821716,Microbial Contamination of Drinking Water and Human Health from Community Water Systems.,"A relatively short list of reference viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens appears adequate to assess microbial risks and inform a system-based management of drinking waters. Nonetheless, there are data gaps, e.g. human enteric viruses resulting in endemic infection levels if poorly performing disinfection and/or distribution systems are used, and the risks from fungi. Where disinfection is the only treatment and/or filtration is poor, cryptosporidiosis is the most likely enteric disease to be identified during waterborne outbreaks, but generally non-human-infectious genotypes are present in the absence of human or calf fecal contamination. Enteric bacteria may dominate risks during major fecal contamination events that are ineffectively managed. Reliance on culture-based methods exaggerates treatment efficacy and reduces our ability to identify pathogens/indicators; however, next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction approaches are on the cusp of changing that. Overall, water-based Legionella and non-tuberculous mycobacteria probably dominate health burden at exposure points following the various societal uses of drinking water.",['Ashbolt NJ'],2015,2,1,Curr Environ Health Rep,Ashbolt NJ.

Of 81 samples determined to be Legionella-negative by plate culture, 56 and 23 samples were positive by qPCR and EMA-qPCR, respectively. Therefore, EMA treatment decreased the number of Legionella-positive bath water samples detected by qPCR. In contrast, EMA treatment had no effect on cooling tower water samples. We therefore expect that EMA-qPCR is a useful method for the rapid detection of viable Legionella spp. from bath water samples.","['Inoue H', 'Takama T', 'Yoshizaki M', 'Agata K']",2015,20,1,Biocontrol Sci,"Inoue H, et al.

For 16S rRNA, the ratio was highest in mid log phase (7.0×10(3)), and the value that was about 10% of that in the log phase was maintained for six days. The rRNA may be vital in the resting or active but nonculturable cells that are not growing but physiologically active. The expression levels of gyrB mRNA and 16S rRNA can be used as indicators of the growth activity and the physiological activity of L. pneumophila, respectively.

It localizes predominantly to endocytic membranes with a pool also found on trans-Golgi network (TGN) membranes, and is most closely related to the Rab11 subfamily of GTPases. Certain intracellular bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Salmonella enterica utilize Rab14 to promote their maturation and replication. Furthermore, the HIV envelope glycoprotein complex subverts the function of Rab14, and its effector the Rab Coupling Protein (RCP), in order to direct its transport to the plasma membrane. Since the use of antibodies is critical for the functional characterization of cellular proteins and their specificity and sensitivity is crucial in drawing reliable conclusions, it is important to rigorously characterize antibodies prior to their use in cell biology or biochemistry experiments. This is all the more critical in the case of antibodies raised to a protein which belongs to a protein family.

To investigate water quality on the Crow Reservation in Montana, water and biofilm samples were collected from 57 public buildings and private residences served by either treated municipal or individual groundwater well systems. Bacteriological quality was assessed including detection of fecal coliform bacteria and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as well as three potentially pathogenic bacterial genera, Mycobacterium, Legionella, and Helicobacter. All three target genera were detected in drinking water systems on the Crow Reservation. Species detected included the opportunistic and frank pathogens Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium flavescens, Legionella pneumophila, and Helicobacter pylori. Additionally, there was an association between HPC bacteria and the presence of Mycobacterium and Legionella but not the presence of Helicobacter. This research has shown that groundwater and municipal drinking water systems on the Crow Reservation can harbor potential bacterial pathogens.","['Richards CL', 'Broadaway SC', 'Eggers MJ', 'Doyle J', 'Pyle BH', 'Camper AK', 'Ford TE']",2018,76,1,Microb Ecol,"Richards CL, et al.

25791653,[The clinical value of urinary antigen detection of Legionella pneumonia].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical value of urinary antigen detection of Legionella, and to describe the clinical characteristics of Legionella pneumonia.
METHODS: Patients with suspected Legionella pneumonia were enrolled from the Respiratory departments of 3 tertiary hospitals in Shenyang during May 2011 to November 2013. Urinary Legionella antigen was detected for all the enrolled patients. Bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Legionella, and double Legionella antibody detection in sera were performed for each patient whose urinary antigen was positive. Patients confirmed to have Legionella pneumonia were pooled and analyzed.
RESULTS: Totally 13 cases presenting with pneumonia were positive for Legionella by the urinary antigen method, and in one of them Legionella strain was isolated from the secretion of lower respiratory tract. PCR detection was performed in 8 patients, and 4 of them were positive. Legionella antibody detection was performed in 12 patients, and 7 of them were positive. Nine patients had a history of exposure to Legionella high-risk environments. The characteristics of the cases with Legionella pneumonia were as follows: characteristic orange sputum in 4 patients, digestive symptoms in 6, neurologic disorders in 8, hyponatremia in 10, hypoxia with oxygenation index < 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) in 11, and severe pneumonia with PSI of grade V (PSI score > 130) in 8 patients . Chest CT scan showed bilateral involvement in 6, ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation in 11, and moderate pleural effusion in 11 patients. Cavity and reversed halo sign were found in one case, respectively. All of the patients received fluoroquinolone treatment, and 11 patients recovered completely while 2 died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, one of them was complicated with secondary infection.
CONCLUSION: Detection of urinary antigen of Legionella is very useful in the diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia. Attention should be paid to exposure history to the high-risk environments and multiple organ impairment when Legionella infection is suspected. Orange sputum may be characteristic for Legionella pneumonia and therefore a clue for diagnosis. In critical cases, secondary infection and additional lung injuries induced by high concentration oxygen therapy may occur.","['Jiang L', 'Chen Y', 'Xia S', 'Ma J', 'Zhao H', 'Lu Y', 'Tao S', 'Zhao L']",2015,38,1,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,"Jiang L, et al.

25774976,Confirmed and Potential Sources of Legionella Reviewed.,"Legionella bacteria are ubiquitous in natural matrices and man-made systems. However, it is not always clear if these reservoirs can act as source of infection resulting in cases of Legionnaires' disease. This review provides an overview of reservoirs of Legionella reported in the literature, other than drinking water distribution systems. Levels of evidence were developed to discriminate between potential and confirmed sources of Legionella. A total of 17 systems and matrices could be classified as confirmed sources of Legionella. Many other man-made systems or natural matrices were not classified as a confirmed source, since either no patients were linked to these reservoirs or the supporting evidence was weak. However, these systems or matrices could play an important role in the transmission of infectious Legionella bacteria; they might not yet be considered in source investigations, resulting in an underestimation of their importance. To optimize source investigations it is important to have knowledge about all the (potential) sources of Legionella. Further research is needed to unravel what the contribution is of each confirmed source, and possibly also potential sources, to the LD disease burden.","['van Heijnsbergen E', 'Schalk JA', 'Euser SM', 'Brandsema PS', 'den Boer JW', 'de Roda Husman AM']",2015,49,8,Environ Sci Technol,"van Heijnsbergen E, et al.

25761613,Predictors of positive or negative legionella urinary antigen test in community-acquired pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumonia remains a diagnostic challenge. The legionella urinary antigen test (LUT) primarily detects Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, accounting for 64% of Danish cases, and is often the only legionella test performed. We aimed to identify variables predictive of a positive or negative test result and to explore how the LUT was used in clinical practice.
METHODS: The study was an audit-based cohort study. LUT-positive patients were compared with three randomly selected age- and gender-matched LUT-negative referent patients admitted at a Danish university hospital during 2003-2013. Data were extracted from charts and databases. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated. For CURB-65 and sepsis, sensitivity analyses were made due to incomplete data.
RESULTS: In all, 25 cases were compared with 75 referents. Factors associated with LUT positivity included recent travel outside Scandinavia (LR + 5.3), Na(+) < 130 mEq/L (LR + 4.3), confusion (LR + 4.2), C-reactive protein (CRP) > 200 mg/L (LR + 3.5), temperature > 39 °C (LR + 3.5), and CURB-65 score ≥ 3 (LR + 3.0-15.0, depending on the model). Decreasing the likelihood of LUT positivity were CRP < 200 mg/L (LR- 0.1), absence of sepsis (LR- 0.1-0.2, depending on the model), absence of tachycardia (heart rate < 90) (LR- 0.2) and normal pulmonary auscultation (LR- 0.3). Additional legionella tests were performed in 60% of the cases and 13% of the referents.
CONCLUSION: Classical features of severe pneumonia are associated with a positive LUT. The LUT is often used inappropriately and should be accompanied by PCR analysis.","['Roed T', 'Schønheyder HC', 'Nielsen H']",2015,47,7,Infect Dis (Lond),"Roed T, et al.

25759346,[Legionella spp. contamination in indoor air: preliminary results of an Italian multicenter study].,"OBJECTIVE: To propose a standardized protocol for the evaluation of Legionella contamination in air.
DESIGN: A bathroom having a Legionella contamination in water >1,000 cfu/l was selected in 10 different healthcare facilities. Air contamination was assessed by active (Surface Air System, SAS) and passive (Index of Microbial Air, IMA) sampling for 8 hours, about 1 m away from the floor and 50 cm from the tap water. Two hundred liters of air were sampled by SAS every 12 min, after flushing water for 2 min. The IMA value was calculated as the mean value of colony forming units/16 plates exposed during sampling (2 plates/hour). Water contamination was evaluated at T0, after 4 and 8 hours, according to the standard methods.
RESULTS: Air contamination by Legionella was found in three healthcare facilities (one with active and two with passive sampling), showing a concomitant tap water contamination (median=40,000; range 1,100-43,000 cfu/l). The remaining seven hospitals isolated Legionella spp. exclusively from water samples (median=8,000; range 1,200-70,000 cfu/l).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that environmental Legionella contamination cannot be assessed only through the air sampling, even in the presence of an important water contamination.","['Montagna MT', 'De Giglio O', 'Napoli C', 'Cannova L', 'Cristina ML', 'Deriu MG', 'Delia SA', 'Giuliano A', 'Guida M', 'Laganà P', 'Liguori G', 'Mura I', 'Pennino F', 'Rossini A', 'Tardivo S', 'Torre I', 'Torregrossa MV', 'Villafrate MR', 'Albertini R', 'Pasquarella C']",2014,38,6 Suppl 2,Epidemiol Prev,"Montagna MT, et al.

25751402,Prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infections in Central China.,"Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children under the age of 5 years. Almost 2 million children die from ARTIs each year, and most of them are from developing countries. The prevalence and correlation of pathogens in ARTIs are poorly understood, but are critical for improving case prevention, treatment, and management. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in children with ARTIs. A total of 39,756 children with one or more symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, herpangina, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, were enrolled in the study. All patients were hospitalized in Wuhan Children's Hospital between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012, and were evaluated for infectious agents. Pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii, were screened simultaneously in patient blood samples using anti-pathogen IgM tests. Regression analysis was used to reveal correlations among the pathogens. Our results showed that one or more pathogens were identified in 10,206 patients, and that Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and influenza B virus were the leading infectious agents. Mixed-infections of pathogens were detected in 2,391 cases, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen. The most common agents in the co-infections were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza B virus. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. The prevalence of infectious agents in children with ARTIs was determined. Equations were established to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection. This revealed a linear correlation for pathogens in children with ARTIs. This study provides useful information for improving case prevention and management.","['Liu J', 'Ai H', 'Xiong Y', 'Li F', 'Wen Z', 'Liu W', 'Li T', 'Qin K', 'Wu J', 'Liu Y']",2015,10,3,PLoS One,"Liu J, et al.

Here, we applied the Nucleic Acid-Programmable Protein Array and a HaloTag-Halo ligand detection system to determine the interaction network of Legionella pneumophila effectors (SidM and LidA) with 10 000 unique human proteins. We identified known targets of these L. pneumophila proteins and potentially novel interaction candidates. In addition, we applied our Click chemistry-based NAPPA platform to identify the substrates for SidM, an effector with an adenylyl transferase domain that catalyzes AMPylation (adenylylation), the covalent addition of adenosine monophosphate (AMP). We confirmed a subset of the novel SidM and LidA targets in independent in vitro pull-down and in vivo cell-based assays, and provided further insight into how these effectors may discriminate between different host Rab GTPases. Our method circumvents the purification of thousands of human and pathogen proteins, and does not require antibodies against or prelabeling of query proteins. This system is amenable to high-throughput analysis of effectors from a wide variety of human pathogens that may bind to and/or post-translationally modify targets within the human proteome.","['Yu X', 'Decker KB', 'Barker K', 'Neunuebel MR', 'Saul J', 'Graves M', 'Westcott N', 'Hang H', 'LaBaer J', 'Qiu J', 'Machner MP']",2015,14,4,J Proteome Res,"Yu X, et al.

25738962,Sensing cytosolic RpsL by macrophages induces lysosomal cell death and termination of bacterial infection.,"The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila provokes strong host responses and has proven to be a valuable model for the discovery of novel immunosurveillance pathways. Our previous work revealed that an environmental isolate of L. pneumophila induces a noncanonical form of cell death, leading to restriction of bacterial replication in primary mouse macrophages. Here we show that such restriction also occurs in infections with wild type clinical isolates. Importantly, we found that a lysine to arginine mutation at residue 88 (K88R) in the ribosome protein RpsL that not only confers bacterial resistance to streptomycin, but more importantly, severely attenuated the induction of host cell death and enabled L. pneumophila to replicate in primary mouse macrophages. Although conferring similar resistance to streptomycin, a K43N mutation in RpsL does not allow productive intracellular bacterial replication. Further analysis indicated that RpsL is capable of effectively inducing macrophage death via a pathway involved in lysosomal membrane permeabilization; the K88R mutant elicits similar responses but is less potent. Moreover, cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease that causes cell death after being released into the cytosol upon the loss of membrane integrity, is required for efficient RpsL-induced macrophage death. Furthermore, despite the critical role of cathepsin B in delaying RpsL-induced cell death, macrophages lacking cathepsin B do not support productive intracellular replication of L. pneumophila harboring wild type RpsL. This suggests the involvement of other yet unidentified components in the restriction of bacterial replication. Our results identified RpsL as a regulator in the interactions between bacteria such as L. pneumophila and primary mouse macrophages by triggering unique cellular pathways that restrict intracellular bacterial replication.","['Zhu W', 'Tao L', 'Quick ML', 'Joyce JA', 'Qu JM', 'Luo ZQ']",2015,11,3,PLoS Pathog,"Zhu W, et al.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A rapid, culture-based method capable of quantifying as few as 600 Legionella microcolonies per litre within 2 days in industrial waters was developed. The method combines a short cultivation step of microcolonies on GVPC agar plate, specific detection of Legionella cells by a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) approach, and a sensitive enumeration using a solid-phase cytometer.

METHODS: Q-fever patients participated at four time points until 12 months after onset of illness, patients with Legionnaires' disease only at 12 months. Data were self-reported using questionnaires on the amount of hours that patients worked, and on socio-demographic, medical, psychosocial and lifestyle aspects.
RESULTS: Our study included 336 Q-fever patients and 190 patients with Legionnaires' disease.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adults hospitalized in the United States with a diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia in the Premier Perspectives database (1 July 2008-30 June 2013). Our primary outcome was hospital mortality; we additionally evaluated hospital length of stay, development of Clostridium difficile colitis, and total hospital cost. We used propensity-based matching to compare patients treated with azithromycin vs a quinolone. All analyses were repeated on a subgroup of more severely ill patients, defined as requiring intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation or having a predicted probability of hospital mortality in the top quartile for all patients.
RESULTS: Legionella pneumonia was diagnosed in 3152 adults across 437 hospitals. Quinolones alone were used in 28.8%, azithromycin alone was used in 34.0%, and 1.8% received both. Crude hospital mortality was similar: 6.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0%-8.2%) for quinolones vs 6.4% (95% CI, 5.0%-7.9%) for azithromycin (P = .87); after propensity matching (n = 813 in each group), mortality remained similar (6.3% [95% CI, 4.6%-7.9%] vs 6.5% [95% CI, 4.8%-8.2%], P = .84 for the whole cohort, and 14.9% [95% CI, 10.0%-19.8%] vs 18.3% [95% CI, 13.0%-23.6%], P = .36 for the more severely ill).

25722040,Legionnaires' disease in France.,"The aim of this review was to describe the current knowledge of Legionnaires' disease (LD) illustrated by the epidemiological situation in France in 2013. LD is a severe pneumonia commonly caused by Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. The diagnosis is usually based on the urinary antigen test. This rapid method reduces the delay between clinical suspicion and initiation of an appropriate treatment. However, the availability of a clinical strain is important to improve knowledge of circulating bacteria, to document case clusters, and to identify the sources of contamination. The source of contamination is unknown in most cases. The main contamination sources generating aerosols are water network systems and cooling towers. Thanks to the strengthening of clinical and environmental monitoring and to several guidelines, no epidemic has been reported in France since 2006. Despite these efforts, the number of LD cases has not decreased in recent years. It is essential that applied research continue to better understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of the disease and its characteristics (impact of environmental factors, sources of exposure, strains, host, etc.). Fundamental knowledge has been greatly improved (pathogenesis, immune mechanisms, etc.). The results of this research should help define new strategies for the diagnosis, prevention, and control to decrease the number of LD cases diagnosed every year.","['Campèse C', 'Descours G', 'Lepoutre A', 'Beraud L', 'Maine C', 'Che D', 'Jarraud S']",2015,45,3,Med Mal Infect,"Campèse C, et al.

Community analysis based on 16S rRNA gene clone libraries indicated that Actinobacteria (Mycobacterium spp.) and α-Proteobacteria represented nearly 43 and 38% of the total sequences, respectively. Sequences closely related to Legionella, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio spp. were also identified. In spite of the high number of sequences (71%) shared in both areas, multivariable analysis revealed significant differences between the GW and SW areas. While the dominant phylotypes where not significantly contributing in the ordination of samples, the populations associated with the core of phylotypes (1-10% in each sample) significantly contributed to the differences between both service areas. Diversity indices indicate that the microbial community inhabiting the SW area is more diverse and contains more distantly related species coexisting with local assemblages as compared with the GW area. The bacterial community structure of SW and GW service areas were dissimilar, suggesting that their respective source water and/or water quality parameters shaped by the treatment processes may contribute to the differences in community structure observed.","['Gomez-Alvarez V', 'Humrighouse BW', 'Revetta RP', 'Santo Domingo JW']",2015,13,1,J Water Health,"Gomez-Alvarez V, et al.

25713573,Post-translational modifications are key players of the Legionella pneumophila infection strategy.,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are widely used by eukaryotes to control the enzymatic activity, localization or stability of their proteins. Traditionally, it was believed that the broad biochemical diversity of the PTMs is restricted to eukaryotic cells, which exploit it in extensive networks to fine-tune various and complex cellular functions. During the last decade, the advanced detection methods of PTMs and functional studies of the host-pathogen relationships highlight that bacteria have also developed a large arsenal of PTMs, particularly to subvert host cell pathways to their benefit. Legionella pneumophila, the etiological agent of the severe pneumonia legionellosis, is the paradigm of highly adapted intravacuolar pathogens that have set up sophisticated biochemical strategies. Among them, L. pneumophila has evolved eukaryotic-like and rare/novel PTMs to hijack host cell processes. Here, we review recent progress about the diversity of PTMs catalyzed by Legionella: ubiquitination, prenylation, phosphorylation, glycosylation, methylation, AMPylation, and de-AMPylation, phosphocholination, and de-phosphocholination.

25712880,Environmental surveillance and molecular epidemiology of waterborne pathogen Legionella pneumophila in health-care facilities of Northeastern Greece: a 4-year survey.,"A 4-year proactive environmental surveillance of Legionella spp. in the water distribution and cooling systems of five health-care facilities was carried out as part of the strategy for the prevention of hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease in Northeastern Greece. Legionella spp. were detected in 71 out of 458 collected samples. The majority of strains belonged to Legionella pneumophila serogroups 2-15 (75.0%), while all L. pneumophila serogroup 1 strains (23.6%) were isolated from a single hospital. The highest percentage of positive samples was found in distal sites (19.4%), while no Legionella strains were detected in cooling systems. Each hospital was colonized at least once with L. pneumophila, while remedial actions resulted in significant reduction of Legionella concentration. The molecular epidemiology of environmental L. pneumophila strains was also investigated using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and multi-gene sequence-based analysis. Based on RAPD patterns, L. pneumophila serogroups 2-15 and serogroup 1 strains were classified into 24 and 9 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively. Sequencing of housekeeping and diversifying pressure-related genes recommended by European Working Group for Legionella Infections (EWGLI) revealed not only a high intraspecies variability but also the circulation and persistence of one specific genotyping profile in the majority of hospitals. This study highlights the necessity for diachronic surveillance of Legionella in health-care facilities by adopting both cultural and molecular methods.","['Alexandropoulou IG', 'Ntougias S', 'Konstantinidis TG', 'Parasidis TA', 'Panopoulou M', 'Constantinidis TC']",2015,22,10,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Alexandropoulou IG, et al.

25711357,Impact of a risk management plan on Legionella contamination of dental unit water.,"The study aimed to assess the prevalence of Legionella spp. in dental unit waterlines of a dental clinic and to verify whether the microbiological parameters used as indicators of water quality were correlated with Legionella contamination. A risk management plan was subsequently implemented in the dental health care setting, in order to verify whether the adopted disinfection protocols were effective in preventing Legionella colonization. The water delivered from syringes and turbines of 63 dental units operating in a dental clinic, was monitored for counts of the heterotrophic bacteria P. aeruginosa and Legionella spp. (22 °C and 37 °C). At baseline, output water from dental units continuously treated with disinfection products was more compliant with the recommended standards than untreated and periodically treated water. However, continuous disinfection was still not able to prevent contamination by Legionella and P. aeruginosa. Legionella was isolated from 36.4%, 24.3% and 53.3% of samples from untreated, periodically and continuously treated waterlines, respectively. The standard microbiological parameters used as indicators of water quality proved to be unreliable as predictors of the presence of Legionella, whose source was identified as the tap water used to supply the dental units. The adoption of control measures, including the use of deionized water in supplying the dental unit waterlines and the application of a combined protocol of continuous and periodic disinfection, with different active products for the different devices, resulted in good control of Legionella contamination. The efficacy of the measures adopted was mainly linked to the strict adherence to the planned protocols, which placed particular stress on staff training and ongoing environmental monitoring.","['Leoni E', 'Dallolio L', 'Stagni F', 'Sanna T', ""D'Alessandro G"", 'Piana G']",2015,12,3,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Leoni E, et al.

To ensure hygienically safe drinking water, technical guidelines recommend a central potable water hot (PWH) supply temperature of at least 60°C at the calorifier. In a clinic building we monitored whether slightly lowered temperatures in the PWH system led to a systemic change in the growth of these pathogens. In four separate phases we tested different scenarios concerning PWH supply temperatures and disinfection with chlorine dioxide (ClO2). In each phase, we took 5 sets of samples at 17 representative sampling points in the building's drinking water plumbing system. In total we collected 476 samples from the PWH system. All samples were tested (culture-based) for Legionella spp. and serogroups. Additionally, quantitative parameters at each sampling point were collected, which could possibly be associated with the presence of Legionella spp. (Pseudomonas aeruginsoa, heterotrophic plate count at 20°C and 36°C, temperatures, time until constant temperatures were reached, and chlorine dioxide concentration). The presence of Legionella spp. showed no significant reactions after reducing the PWH supply temperature from 63°C to 60°C and 57°C, as long as disinfection with ClO2 was maintained. After omitting the disinfectant, the PWH system showed statistically significant growth rates at 57°C. PWH temperatures which are permanently lowered to less than recommended values should be carefully accompanied by frequent testing, a thorough evaluation of the building's drinking water plumbing system, and hygiene expertise.","['Völker S', 'Kistemann T']",2015,36,13-16,Environ Technol,Völker S and Kistemann T.

25706222,Microbial health risks associated with exposure to stormwater in a water plaza.,"Climate change scenarios predict an increase of intense rainfall events in summer in Western Europe. Current urban drainage systems cannot cope with such intense precipitation events. Cities are constructing stormwater storage facilities to prevent pluvial flooding. Combining storage with other functions, such as recreation, may lead to exposure to contaminants. This study assessed the microbial quality of rainwater collected in a water plaza and the health risks associated with recreational exposure. The water plaza collects street run-off, diverges first flush to the sewer system and stores the rest of the run-off in the plaza as open water. Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium and Legionella pneumophila were the pathogens investigated. Microbial source tracking tools were used to determine the origin (human, animal) of the intestinal pathogens. Cryptosporidium was not found in any sample. Campylobacter was found in all samples, with higher concentrations in samples containing human Bacteroides than in samples with zoonotic contamination (15 vs 3.7 gc (genomic copies)/100 mL). In both cases, the estimated disease risk associated with Campylobacter and recreational exposure was higher than the Dutch national incidence. This indicates that the health risk associated with recreational exposure to the water plaza is significant. L. pneumophila was found only in two out of ten pond samples. Legionnaire's disease risks were lower than the Dutch national incidence. Presence of human Bacteroides indicates possible cross-connections with the CSS that should be identified and removed.","['Sales-Ortells H', 'Medema G']",2015,74,,Water Res,Sales-Ortells H and Medema G.

25699403,Role of biofilm roughness and hydrodynamic conditions in Legionella pneumophila adhesion to and detachment from simulated drinking water biofilms.,"Biofilms in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) could exacerbate the persistence and associated risks of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), thus raising human health concerns. However, mechanisms controlling adhesion and subsequent detachment of L. pneumophila associated with biofilms remain unclear. We determined the connection between L. pneumophila adhesion and subsequent detachment with biofilm physical structure characterization using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technique. Analysis of the OCT images of multispecies biofilms grown under low nutrient condition up to 34 weeks revealed the lack of biofilm deformation even when these biofilms were exposed to flow velocity of 0.7 m/s, typical flow for DWDS. L. pneumophila adhesion on these biofilm under low flow velocity (0.007 m/s) positively correlated with biofilm roughness due to enlarged biofilm surface area and local flow conditions created by roughness asperities. The preadhered L. pneumophila on selected rough and smooth biofilms were found to detach when these biofilms were subjected to higher flow velocity. At the flow velocity of 0.1 and 0.3 m/s, the ratio of detached cell from the smooth biofilm surface was from 1.3 to 1.4 times higher than that from the rough biofilm surface, presumably because of the low shear stress zones near roughness asperities. This study determined that physical structure and local hydrodynamics control L. pneumophila adhesion to and detachment from simulated drinking water biofilm, thus it is the first step toward reducing the risk of L. pneumophila exposure and subsequent infections.","['Shen Y', 'Monroy GL', 'Derlon N', 'Janjaroen D', 'Huang C', 'Morgenroth E', 'Boppart SA', 'Ashbolt NJ', 'Liu WT', 'Nguyen TH']",2015,49,7,Environ Sci Technol,"Shen Y, et al.

They comprise many novel members and are investigated as emerging pathogens. Environmental studies highlighted similarities between the ecologies of chlamydiae and legionellae, both groups being important agents of respiratory infections. Herein, we analyzed nasal samples from healthy persons, searching for the presence of amoebae, chlamydiae and legionellae. From a total of 25 samples, we recovered by PCR eight samples positive to chlamydiae and six samples positive to legionellae. Among these samples, four were positive to both organisms. The sequencing of 16S rDNAs allowed to identify (i) among Chlamydiae: Parachlamydia acanthamoebae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydophila felis, and members of Rhabdochlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae and E6 lineage and (ii) among Legionellaceae: Legionella longbeachae, Legionella bozemanii and Legionella impletisoli. Unexpectedly, we also recovered Diplorickettsia sp. Amoebae collected from nasal mucosae, Acanthamoeba and Vermamoeba, were endosymbiont-free, and chlamydiae revealed refractory to amoeba coculture. This study shows common exposure to chlamydiae and legionellae and suggests open air activities like gardening as a probable additional source of infection.","['Corsaro D', 'Venditti D']",2015,60,4,Folia Microbiol (Praha),Corsaro D and Venditti D.

25697664,Isolation of Vermamoeba vermiformis and associated bacteria in hospital water.,"To detect new potential pathogens in hospital water, we isolated free-living amoebae in water samples taken from three different hospitals in Marseille (France). The samples were inoculated in media containing saline buffer and various bacteria as nutrient sources. The isolated amoebae were identified by gene sequencing. Among the 105 water samples, taken from 19 sites, we isolated 14 amoebae, of which 9 Vermamoeba vermiformis and 5 Acanthamoeba sp. None of the amoebae showed the presence of obligate bacterial endosymbionts. Because V. vermiformis was most commonly isolated, we used an axenic collection strain to isolate amoeba-resistant bacteria from the same sites. The isolated bacterial species included Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Legionella sp. Legionella taurinensis was isolated for the first time in association with amoebae. A strict intracellular bacterium was isolated, that may represent a new genus among the Chlamydiales. We propose that it be named ""Candidatus Rubidus massiliensis"". Our study shows that the isolation and identification of new pathogens associated with amoebae, which were previously performed using Acanthamoeba sp., should instead use V. vermiformis because this organism is more commonly associated with humans and is an essential complement of Acanthamoeba sp. co-culture to study the ecology of hospital water supplies.","['Pagnier I', 'Valles C', 'Raoult D', 'La Scola B']",2015,80,,Microb Pathog,"Pagnier I, et al.

25686789,Influence of copper surfaces on biofilm formation by Legionella pneumophila in potable water.,"Legionella pneumophila is a waterborne pathogen that can cause Legionnaires' disease, a fatal pneumonia, or Pontiac fever, a mild form of disease. Copper is an antimicrobial material used for thousands of years. Its incorporation in several surface materials to control the transmission of pathogens has been gaining importance in the past decade. In this work, the ability of copper to control the survival of L. pneumophila in biofilms was studied. For that, the incorporation of L. pneumophila in polymicrobial drinking water biofilms formed on copper, PVC and PEX, and L. pneumophila mono-species biofilms formed on copper and uPVC were studied by comparing cultivable and total numbers (quantified by peptide nucleic acid (PNA) hybridisation). L. pneumophila was never recovered by culture from heterotrophic biofilms; however, PNA-positive numbers were slightly higher in biofilms formed on copper (5.9 × 10(5) cells cm(-2)) than on PVC (2.8 × 10(5) cells cm(-2)) and PEX (1.7 × 10(5) cells cm(-2)). L. pneumophila mono-species biofilms grown on copper gave 6.9 × 10(5) cells cm(-2) for PNA-positive cells and 4.8 × 10(5) CFU cm(-2) for cultivable numbers, showing that copper is not directly effective in killing L. pneumophila. Therefore previous published studies showing inactivation of L. pneumophila by copper surfaces in potable water polymicrobial species biofilms must be carefully interpreted.","['Gião MS', 'Wilks SA', 'Keevil CW']",2015,28,2,Biometals,"Gião MS, et al.

Its unique structure makes it a valuable biological probe, but access via isolation is difficult and no practical synthesis has been reported. We describe a stereoselective synthesis that yields a legionaminic acid building block as well as linker-equipped conjugation-ready legionaminic acid starting from cheap d-threonine. To set the desired amino and hydroxyl group pattern of the target, we designed a concise sequence of stereoselective reactions. The key transformations rely on chelation-controlled organometallic additions and a Petasis multicomponent reaction. The legionaminic acid was synthesized in a form that enables attachment to surfaces. Glycan microarray containing legionaminic acid revealed that human antibodies bind the synthetic glycoside.

25666151,Moxifloxacin pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy evaluation in empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.,"When antimicrobials are used empirically, pathogen MICs equal to clinical breakpoints or epidemiological cutoff values must be considered. This is to ensure that the most resistant pathogen subpopulation is appropriately targeted to prevent emergence of resistance. Accordingly, we determined the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of moxifloxacin at 400 mg/day in 18 patients treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia. We developed a population pharmacokinetic model to assess the potential efficacy of moxifloxacin and to simulate the maximal MICs for which recommended pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) estimates are obtained. Moxifloxacin plasma concentrations were determined the day after therapy initiation using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. Peak drug concentrations (Cmax) and area under the free drug concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (fAUC0-24) values predicted for each patient were evaluated against epidemiological cutoff MIC values for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Legionella pneumophila. PK-PD targets adopted were a Cmax/MIC of ≥12.2 for all pathogens, an fAUC0-24/MIC of >34 for S. pneumoniae, and an fAUC0-24/MIC of >75 for H. influenzae and L. pneumophila. Individual predicted estimates for Cmax/MIC and fAUC0-24/MIC as well as simulated maximal MICs resulting in target attainment for oral and intravenous administration of the drug were suitable for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae but not for L. pneumophila. These results indicate that caution must be taken when moxifloxacin is used as monotherapy to treat community-acquired pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila. In conclusion, this report reveals key information relevant to the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia while highlighting the robust and flexible nature of this population pharmacokinetic model to predict therapeutic success.

Mip exhibits peptidyl prolyl cistrans isomerase (PPIase) activity, which can be inhibited by Rapamycin and FK506. Mutation of Mip protein on catalytic residues at Aspartate-142 position replaced to Leucine-142 and Tyrosine-185 position replaced to Alanine-185 that strongly reduces the PPIase activity. Therefore, we aim to develop an in-silico mutagenesis model for both important catalytic residues, validated the stability of the mutated model. Further, we have docked to the known inhibitor rapamycin with Lp Mip (native) and mutants (D142L and Y185A) to analyze the conformational and binding model.

Prevention of outbreaks caused by pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila would be facilitated by the development of sensitive and specific bioanalytical assays that can be easily integrated in miniaturized fluidic handling systems. In this work, we report on the integration of an amplification-free assay in digital microfluidics (DMF) for the detection of Legionella bacteria based on targeting 16s rRNA. We first review the design of the developed DMF devices, which provide the capability to store up to one hundred nL-size droplets simultaneously, and discuss the challenges involved with on-chip integration of the RNA-based assay. By optimizing the various steps of the assay, including magnetic capture, hybridization duration, washing steps, and assay temperature, a limit of detection as low as 1.8 attomoles of synthetic 16s rRNA was obtained, which compares advantageously to other amplification-free detection systems. Finally, we demonstrate the specificity of the developed assay by performing multiplex detection of 16s rRNAs from a pathogenic and a non-pathogenic species of Legionella. We believe the developed DMF devices combined with the proposed detection system offers new prospects for the deployment of rapid and cost-effective technologies for on-site monitoring of pathogenic bacteria.","['Foudeh AM', 'Brassard D', 'Tabrizian M', 'Veres T']",2015,15,6,Lab Chip,"Foudeh AM, et al.

25643265,"The Legionella pneumophila effector protein, LegC7, alters yeast endosomal trafficking.","The intracellular pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, relies on numerous secreted effector proteins to manipulate host endomembrane trafficking events during pathogenesis, thereby preventing fusion of the bacteria-laden phagosome with host endolysosomal compartments, and thus escaping degradation. Upon expression in the surrogate eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that the L. pneumophila LegC7/YlfA effector protein disrupts the delivery of both biosynthetic and endocytic cargo to the yeast vacuole. We demonstrate that the effects of LegC7 are specific to the endosome:vacuole delivery pathways; LegC7 expression does not disrupt other known vacuole-directed pathways. Deletions of the ESCRT-0 complex member, VPS27, provide resistance to the LegC7 toxicity, providing a possible target for LegC7 function in vivo. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution in LegC7 abrogates both its toxicity and ability to alter endosomal traffic in vivo, thereby identifying a critical functional domain. LegC7 likely inhibits endosomal trafficking during L. pneumophila pathogenesis to prevent entry of the phagosome into the endosomal maturation pathway and eventual fusion with the lysosome.","[""O'Brien KM"", 'Lindsay EL', 'Starai VJ']",2015,10,2,PLoS One,"O'Brien KM, et al.

The phylum Proteobacteria dominated the data set (80.5 % of all reads), while 4.2 % of the reads could not be classified to any of the known phyla at a probability of 0.8 or higher (unclassified bacteria). At class level, the classes; Betaproteobacteria (50.4 % of all reads), Alphaproteobacteria (16.2 %), Verrucomicrobiae (6.6 %), Planctomycetacia (5.7 %), and Sphingobacteria (3 %) dominated the data set in all the samples. Although the class Verrucomicrobiae constituted 6.6 % of all sequences, 88.6 % of the sequences were from the river sample where the class represented 43.7 % of the observed sequences in the sample. The bacteria community structure clearly showed significant similarities between RHRW and differences with the river water control sample, suggesting different levels of contamination and environmental factors affecting the various water sources. Moreover, signatures of potential pathogens including Legionella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Clostridia, Chromobacterium, Yersinia, and Serratia were detected, and the proportions of Legionella were relatively higher suggesting a potential health risk to households using RHRW.

25622002,Temperature diagnostic to identify high risk areas and optimize Legionella pneumophila surveillance in hot water distribution systems.,"Legionella pneumophila is frequently detected in hot water distribution systems and thermal control is a common measure implemented by health care facilities. A risk assessment based on water temperature profiling and temperature distribution within the network is proposed, to guide effective monitoring strategies and allow the identification of high risk areas. Temperature and heat loss at control points (water heater, recirculation, representative points-of-use) were monitored in various sections of five health care facilities hot water distribution systems and results used to develop a temperature-based risk assessment tool. Detailed investigations show that defective return valves in faucets can cause widespread temperature losses because of hot and cold water mixing. Systems in which water temperature coming out of the water heaters was kept consistently above 60 °C and maintained above 55 °C across the network were negative for Legionella by culture or qPCR. For systems not meeting these temperature criteria, risk areas for L. pneumophila were identified using temperature profiling and system's characterization; higher risk was confirmed by more frequent microbiological detection by culture and qPCR. Results confirmed that maintaining sufficiently high temperatures within hot water distribution systems suppressed L. pneumophila culturability. However, the risk remains as shown by the persistence of L. pneumophila by qPCR.","['Bédard E', 'Fey S', 'Charron D', 'Lalancette C', 'Cantin P', 'Dolcé P', 'Laferrière C', 'Déziel E', 'Prévost M']",2015,71,,Water Res,"Bédard E, et al.

The authors collected 3,495 water samples in Seoul, Korea, between 2010 and 2012 from public facilities (cooling towers, public baths, hospitals, and decorative fountains), which are considered the major habitats of Legionella pneumophila. In all, 527 (15.1%) isolates of L. pneumophila were obtained by microbial culture and polymerase chain reaction. Serological diagnosis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis were performed for the samples. The authors categorized the samples into four groups (A-D) on the basis of PFGE results. The analysis revealed that cooling towers containing the most samples with L. pneumophila serogroup 1 constituted the highest proportion of isolate. Samples from public facilities and serogroups could be distinctively classified by PFGE patterns. Thus, it is expected that source-specific features revealed through PFGE and serological analyses could serve as the basis for effectively coping with future outbreaks of L. pneumophila.","['Kim C', 'Jeon S', 'Jung J', 'Oh Y', 'Kim Y', 'Lee J', 'Choi S', 'Chae Y', 'Lee YK']",2015,77,6,J Environ Health,"Kim C, et al.

Invasive Neisseria meningitidis, isolated in Scotland between 1972 and 1998, were characterised retrospectively to examine the serogroup and clonal structure of the circulating population. 2607 isolates causing invasive disease were available for serogroup and MLST analysis whilst 2517 were available for multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis only. Serogroup distribution changed from year to year but serogroups B and C were dominant throughout. Serogroup B was dominant throughout the 1970s and early 1980s until serogroup C became dominant during the mid-1980s. The increase in serogroup C was not associated with one particular sequence type (ST) but was associated with a number of STs, including ST-8, ST-11, ST-206 and ST-334. This is in contrast to the increase in serogroup C disease seen in the 1990s that was due to expansion of the ST-11 clonal complex. While there was considerable diversity among the isolates (309 different STs among the 2607 isolates), a large proportion of isolates (59.9%) were associated with only 10 STs. These data highlight meningococcal diversity over time and the need for ongoing surveillance during the introduction of new meningococcal vaccines.","['Sullivan CB', 'Diggle MA', 'Davies RL', 'Clarke SC']",2015,10,1,PLoS One,"Sullivan CB, et al.

Following a microbiological examination via culture, 2246 subcultures were generated out of 285 Salmonella positive samples and analysed by pheno- and genotyping methods. Based on a combination of serotyping, MLVA (multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis), PFGE (pulse-field gel electrophoresis) and MLST (multilocus sequence typing), an amount of 22.3% Salmonella positive samples were characterized in clonal lineages and its variants. Within each production cluster, one main clonal lineage could be identified and persisted over both production cycles with a large diversity of variants and a wide distribution in sample site categories and production stages. Results underline the importance of biosecurity with emphasis on the environment to prevent persistence and circulation of Salmonella within herds. Furthermore, the combined implementation of MLVA, PFGE and MLST with conventional culture techniques for isolate classification could be successfully applied as an effective and valuable tool for identifying similar pattern of Salmonella occurrence within pig production clusters.","['Niemann J', 'Tietze E', 'Ruddat I', 'Fruth A', 'Prager R', 'Rabsch W', 'Blaha T', 'Münchhausen C', 'Merle R', 'Kreienbrock L']",2015,176,1-2,Vet Microbiol,"Niemann J, et al.

25582583,"Novel export control of a Legionella Dot/Icm substrate is mediated by dual, independent signal sequences.","The Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm T4SS injects ∼ 300 protein effector proteins into host cells. Dot/Icm substrates have been proposed to contain a carboxy-terminal signal sequence that is necessary and sufficient for export, although both traits have been demonstrated for only a small fraction of these proteins. In this study, we discovered that export of the substrate SidJ is mediated by dual signal sequences that include a conventional C-terminal domain and a novel internal motif. The C-terminal signal sequence facilitates secretion of SidJ into host cells at early points of infection, whereas the internal signal sequence mediates secretion at later time points. Interestingly, only the internal signal sequence is necessary for complementation of the intracellular growth defect of a ΔsidJ mutant. Although this is the first report of a Dot/Icm substrate being secreted by an internal signal sequence, many other substrates may be exported in a similar manner. In addition, efficient translocation of SidJ is dependent on the chaperone-like type IV adaptors IcmS/IcmW. Five IcmS/IcmW binding domains that are distinct from both signal sequences were elucidated and, interestingly, only secretion mediated by the internal signal sequence requires IcmS/IcmW.

In the present study, we investigated the presence of different virulence factors and genes in Sphingomonas bacteria. We utilized phylogenetic, comparative genomics and bioinformatics analysis to investigate the potentiality of Sphingomonas bacteria as virulent pathogenic bacteria. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA) phylogenetic tree showed that the closest bacterial taxon to Sphingomonas is Brucella with a bootstrap value of 87 followed by Helicobacter, Campylobacter, Pseudomonas, and then Legionella. Sphingomonas shared no virulence factors with Helicobacter or Campylobacter, despite their close phylogenic relationship. In spite of the phylogenetic divergence between Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas, they shared many major virulence factors, such as adherence, antiphagocytosis, iron uptake, proteases, and quorum sensing. In conclusion, Sphingomonas spp. contains several major virulence factors resembling Pseudomonas sp., Legionella sp., Brucella sp., and Bordetella sp. virulence factors. Similarity of virulence factors did not match phylogenetic relationships. These findings suggest horizontal gene transfer of virulence factors rather than sharing a common pathogenic ancestor. Sphingomonas spp. is potential virulent bacterial pathogen.","['Saeb AT', 'David SK', 'Al-Brahim H']",2014,10,,Evol Bioinform Online,"Saeb AT, et al.

The bacterial strain was identified as a Bacillus subtilis and named B. subtilis AM1. PCR analysis revealed the presence of the sfp gene, involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin, a lipopeptide with versatile bioactive properties. The bioactive substances were extracted from AM1 cell-free supernatant with ethyl acetate and purified using reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). Subsequent ESI-MS analyses indicated the presence of two active substances with protonated molecular ions at m/z 1008 and 1036 Da, corresponding to surfactin isoforms. Structures of lipopeptides were further determined by tandem mass spectrometry and compared to the spectra of a commercially available surfactin mixture. Surfactin displays an antibacterial spectrum almost restricted to the Legionella genus (MICs range 1-4 μg/mL) and also exhibits a weak activity toward the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii, known to be the natural reservoir of L. pneumophila. Anti-biofilm assays demonstrated that 66 μg/mL of surfactin successfully eliminated 90 % of a 6-day-old biofilm.

Treatment of sporadic cases and rapid control of LD outbreaks benefit from swift diagnosis in concert with discriminatory bacterial typing for immediate epidemiological responses. Traditional culture and serology were instrumental in describing disease incidence early in its history; currently, diagnosis of LD relies almost solely on the urinary antigen test, which captures only the dominant species and serogroup, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1). This has created a diagnostic ""blind spot"" for LD caused by non-Lp1 strains. This review focuses on historic, current, and emerging technologies that hold promise for increasing LD diagnostic efficiency and detection rates as part of a coherent testing regimen.

27019912,[Problems in the serological diagnosis of atypical pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae].,"INTRODUCTION: The clinical presentation of atypical pneumonia is often similar to the presentation of more typical bacterial pneumonias and the etiological agent must be confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. This article will discuss the problems in the serological diagnosis of atypical pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae which are the agents most commonly associated with atypical pneumonia. Specifically, seeking the possibility of non-specific response, we evaluated the prevalence of antibodies to M. pneumoniae in serum samples obtained from patients suspected in clinical investigation for legionellosis.
METHODS: The total numbers of 261 serum obtained from patients suspected in clinical investigation for legionellosis, were tested by in-house ELISA with M. pneumoniae sonicated antigen. Some of the positive sera were also re-tested by western-blot with high specific recombinant M. pneumoniae P1 protein.
RESULTS: The diagnostic significant level of IgA antibodies to M. pneumoniae were diagnosed by ELISA in 71 (27,2%) of tested serum samples. Some of the IgA-positive sera have also high level of IgG and IgM antibodies to M pneumoniae (respectively 4,2% and 6,5%). Most from the 18 selected positive results obtained by ELISA were also confirmed by western-blot. It was characteristic that IgA antibodies to M pneumoniae were detected more than three times often in serum samples with positive serological tests for Legionnaires' disease than in samples with negative results for L. pneumophila.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the possibility of non-specific reactions in serological diagnosis of atypical pneumonia. However, according to the data of the literature, co-infections of L. pneumophila and M pneumoniae can not be excluded.","['Śmietańska K', 'Chróst A', 'Rastawicki W']",2015,67,3-4,Med Dosw Mikrobiol,"Śmietańska K, et al.

25547789,Nuclease activity of Legionella pneumophila Cas2 promotes intracellular infection of amoebal host cells.,"Legionella pneumophila, the primary agent of Legionnaires' disease, flourishes in both natural and man-made environments by growing in a wide variety of aquatic amoebae. Recently, we determined that the Cas2 protein of L. pneumophila promotes intracellular infection of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Hartmannella vermiformis, the two amoebae most commonly linked to cases of disease. The Cas2 family of proteins is best known for its role in the bacterial and archeal clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system that constitutes a form of adaptive immunity against phage and plasmid. However, the infection event mediated by L. pneumophila Cas2 appeared to be distinct from this function, because cas2 mutants exhibited infectivity defects in the absence of added phage or plasmid and since mutants lacking the CRISPR array or any one of the other cas genes were not impaired in infection ability. We now report that the Cas2 protein of L. pneumophila has both RNase and DNase activities, with the RNase activity being more pronounced. By characterizing a catalytically deficient version of Cas2, we determined that nuclease activity is critical for promoting infection of amoebae. Also, introduction of Cas2, but not its catalytic mutant form, into a strain of L. pneumophila that naturally lacks a CRISPR-Cas locus caused that strain to be 40- to 80-fold more infective for amoebae, unequivocally demonstrating that Cas2 facilitates the infection process independently of any other component encoded within the CRISPR-Cas locus. Finally, a cas2 mutant was impaired for infection of Willaertia magna but not Naegleria lovaniensis, suggesting that Cas2 promotes infection of most but not all amoebal hosts.","['Gunderson FF', 'Mallama CA', 'Fairbairn SG', 'Cianciotto NP']",2015,83,3,Infect Immun,"Gunderson FF, et al.

25534767,Legionella pneumophila utilizes a single-player disulfide-bond oxidoreductase system to manage disulfide bond formation and isomerization.,"Legionella pneumophila uses a single homodimeric disulfide bond (DSB) oxidoreductase DsbA2 to catalyze extracytoplasmic protein folding and to correct DSB errors through protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) activity. In Escherichia coli, these functions are separated to avoid futile cycling. In L. pneumophila, DsbA2 is maintained as a mixture of disulfides (S-S) and free thiols (SH), but when expressed in E. coli, only the SH form is observed. We provide evidence to suggest that structural differences in DsbB oxidases (LpDsbB1 and LpDsbB2) and DsbD reductases (LpDsbD1 and LpDsbD2) (compared with E. coli) permit bifunctional activities without creating a futile cycle. LpdsbB1 and LpdsbB2 partially complemented an EcdsbB mutant while neither LpdsbD1 nor LpdsbD2 complemented an EcdsbD mutant unless DsbA2 was also expressed. When the dsb genes of E. coli were replaced with those of L. pneumophila, motility was restored and DsbA2 was present as a mixture of redox forms. A dominant-negative approach to interfere with DsbA2 function in L. pneumophila determined that DSB oxidase activity was necessary for intracellular multiplication and assembly/function of the Dot/Icm Type IVb secretion system.

25524126,First report on prevalence and risk factors of severe atypical pneumonia in Vietnamese children aged 1-15 years.,"BACKGROUND: Atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are increasingly recognized as important causes of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) worldwide. Such etiological data for Vietnam is scarce and clinical doctors lack accurate information on which to base their diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia. This study identifies the prevalence and risk factors of severe community acquired pneumonia due to these atypical pathogens (severe-ApCAP) in children aged 1-15 years with CAP in a pediatric hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam.
METHODS: 722 hospitalized children with CAP were recruited for detecting those atypical pathogens, using multiplex PCR and ELISA. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected. Multivariate logistic-regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of potential risk factors with severe-ApCAP.
RESULTS: Among 215 atypical pathogen-positive CAP cases, 45.12% (97/215) were severe-ApCAP. Among the severe-ApCAP group, 55.67% (54/97) cases were caused by pure atypical pathogens and 44.33% (43/97) resulted from a co-infection with typical respiratory pathogens. M. pneumoniae was the most common, with 86.6% cases (84/97) in the severe-ApCAP group, whereas C. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila were less frequent (6.19% and 7.22%, respectively). The highest rate of severe-ApCAP was in children younger than two years (65.98%). The differences related to age are statistically significant (P = 0.008).The factors significantly associated with severe-ApCAP were age (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.93, P = 0.001), co-infection with typical bacteria (OR = 4.86, 95% CI = 2.17-10.9, P < 0.0001), co-infection with respiratory viruses (OR = 4.36, 95% CI = 1.46-13.0, P = 0.008), respiratory/cardiac system malformation (OR = 14.8, 95% CI = 1.12-196, P = 0.041) and neonatal pneumonia (OR = 11.1, 95% CI = 1.06-116, P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe-ApCAP presented at a significant rate in Vietnamese children. More than 50% of severe-ApCAP cases were associated with pure atypical pathogen infection. M. pneumoniae appeared most frequently. The highest rate of severe-ApCAP was in children younger than two years. Younger age and co-infection with typical bacteria or viruses were the most significant risk factors, while respiratory/cardiac system malformation and neonatal pneumonia were additional potential risk factors, associated with severe-ApCAP in Vietnamese children.","['Huong Ple T', 'Hien PT', 'Lan NT', 'Binh TQ', 'Tuan DM', 'Anh DD']",2014,14,,BMC Public Health,"Huong Ple T, et al.

The main representative of the genus is the bacterial species Legionella pneumophila. Legionella can cause a mild disease with fever but also severe to fatal pneumonia. At highest risk are individuals with an underlying disease, immunosuppressed patients or individuals exposed to other risk factors (e.g. users of addictive substances). Information on the etiology and epidemiology of legionellosis is presented. Selected risk factors are described as well as preventive measures to be taken in water supply and cooling systems.

25518668,[Microbial community of municipal discharges in a sewage treatment plant].,"There are numerous microorganisms, especial pathogens, in the discharges. Those microorganisms are discharged into the river and sea through sewage outfalls, which results in possible health risks to coastal populations. And more attention should be paid to municipal discharges in developing countries. This study investigated the microbial community in the discharges by constructing 16S rDNA clones library and using the PCR-RFLP technology. Phylogenetic analysis of bacteria in municipal discharges showed that there were 59 species, which were divided into 11 classes. Proteobacteria accounted for 85% of all the bacteria, of which β-Proteobacteria and γ- Proteobacteria were the dominant classes. Bacteria in the waste water treating process had important influence on microbial community in municipal discharges, therefore, municipal sewage plant should choose the process according to the characteristics and purifying capacity of the receiving water body. Legionella spp. accounted for approximately 10% , the Legionnaires' disease resulted from which might be of top risk for the residents in the surrounding of the municipal discharges outfall and receiving water. Dechloromonas aromatica could make use of chlorite ( CIO - ) , which led to its survival from chlorine disinfection, and it alerted us that several disinfection methods should be used together to ensure the bacterial safety of municipal discharges. Coliform group and other pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella spp. , Shigella spp. , Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus aureus, Arcobacter spp. were not detected in this study, and it indicated that we should do more work and use more methods to investigate the perniciousness of discharges.","['Xu AL', 'Ren J', 'Song ZW', 'Wu DD', 'Xia Y']",2014,35,9,Huan Jing Ke Xue,"Xu AL, et al.

In this work, we present results on the detection and genetic characterization of these bacteria in the outbreak-recurrent region of Alcoy (Comunidad Valenciana, Spain) using water and biofilm samples. We were particularly interested in studying the presence and distribution of L. pneumophila in the absence of outbreak or sporadic cases of legionellosis and in comparing the efficacy of culturing from water samples with a biofilm-based detection procedure using molecular amplification. To this end, water samples were taken from 120 sites distributed all around the city and its surroundings, as well as 60 biofilm swabs from half of the sampling sites. L. pneumophila could be isolated from water in just 4 of the locations. Touchdown PCR was applied to DNA extracted from water and also biofilm swabs, as a rapid method for both routine and outbreak investigations. L. pneumophila was detected by this method in 14 of the sites in which both water and biofilms were taken, although 13 of them tested positive using only the biofilm samples. These results show a ten-fold increase in the success rate of Legionella detection over water samples. The application of this method to study the presence of L. pneumophila in the water-supply system and risk facilities of Alcoy revealed different strains distributed in different areas of the city. Sequence Type ST578, endemic in the area and responsible for most clinical cases, was detected in one of the sampling sites. The number of positive samples correlated with water temperature but not with chlorine levels. The direct analysis of biofilm swabs improves the detection rate and genetic characterization of L. pneumophila and can complement analyses based on bacterial culture.","['Sánchez-Busó L', 'Olmos MP', 'Camaró ML', 'Adrián F', 'Calafat JM', 'González-Candelas F']",2015,30,,Infect Genet Evol,"Sánchez-Busó L, et al.

25503777,Bartonella henselae endocarditis in Laos - 'the unsought will go undetected'.,"BACKGROUND: Both endocarditis and Bartonella infections are neglected public health problems, especially in rural Asia. Bartonella endocarditis has been described from wealthier countries in Asia, Japan, Korea, Thailand and India but there are no reports from poorer countries, such as the Lao PDR (Laos), probably because people have neglected to look.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective (2006-2012), and subsequent prospective study (2012-2013), at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos, through liaison between the microbiology laboratory and the wards. Patients aged >1 year admitted with definite or possible endocarditis according to modified Duke criteria were included. In view of the strong suspicion of infective endocarditis, acute and convalescent sera from 30 patients with culture negative endocarditis were tested for antibodies to Brucella melitensis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bartonella quintana, B. henselae, Coxiella burnetii and Legionella pneumophila. Western blot analysis using Bartonella species antigens enabled us to describe the first two Lao patients with known Bartonella henselae endocarditis.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We argue that it is likely that Bartonella endocarditis is neglected and more widespread than appreciated, as there are few laboratories in Asia able to make the diagnosis. Considering the high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in Asia, there is remarkably little evidence on the bacterial etiology of endocarditis. Most evidence is derived from wealthy countries and investigation of the aetiology and optimal management of endocarditis in low income countries has been neglected. Interest in Bartonella as neglected pathogens is emerging, and improved methods for the rapid diagnosis of Bartonella endocarditis are needed, as it is likely that proven Bartonella endocarditis can be treated with simpler and less expensive regimens than ""conventional"" endocarditis and multicenter trials to optimize treatment are required. More understanding is needed on the risk factors for Bartonella endocarditis and the importance of vectors and vector control.","['Rattanavong S', 'Fournier PE', 'Chu V', 'Frichitthavong K', 'Kesone P', 'Mayxay M', 'Mirabel M', 'Newton PN']",2014,8,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Rattanavong S, et al.

25498244,On the use of Legionella/Rickettsia chimeras to investigate the structure and regulation of Rickettsia effector RalF.,"A convenient strategy to interrogate the biology of regulatory proteins is to replace individual domains by an equivalent domain from a related protein of the same species or from an ortholog of another species. It is generally assumed that the overall properties of the native protein are retained in the chimera, and that functional differences reflect only the specific determinants contained in the swapped domains. Here we used this strategy to circumvent the difficulty in obtaining crystals of Rickettsia prowazekii RalF, a bacterial protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eukaryotic Arf GTPases. A RalF homolog is encoded by Legionella pneumophila, in which a C-terminal capping domain auto-inhibits the catalytic Sec7 domain and localizes the protein to the Legionella-containing vacuole. The crystal structures of domain-swapped chimeras were determined and used to construct a model of Legionella RalF with a RMSD of less than 1Å with the crystal structure, which validated the use of this approach to build a model of Rickettsia RalF. In the Rickettsia RalF model, sequence differences in the capping domain that target it to specific membranes are accommodated by a shift of the entire domain with respect to the Sec7 domain. However, local sequence changes also give rise to an artifactual salt bridge in one of the chimeras, which likely explains why this chimera is recalcitrant to activation. These findings highlight the structural plasticity whereby chimeras can be engineered, but also underline that unpredictable differences can modify their biochemical responses.","['Folly-Klan M', 'Sancerne B', 'Alix E', 'Roy CR', 'Cherfils J', 'Campanacci V']",2015,189,2,J Struct Biol,"Folly-Klan M, et al.

25490721,Necessity and effect of combating Legionella pneumophila in municipal shower systems.,"The objective was to obtain research-based, holistic knowledge about necessity and effect of practiced measures against L. pneumophila in municipal shower systems in Stavanger, Norway. The effects of hot water treatment and membrane-filtering were investigated and compared to no intervention at all. The studies were done under real-world conditions. Additionally, a surveillance pilot study of municipal showers in Stavanger was performed. The validity of high total plate count (TPC) as an indication of L. pneumophila was evaluated. A simplified method, named ""dripping method"", for detection and quantification of L. pneumophila was developed. The sensitivity of the dripping method is 5 colony-forming units of L. pneumophila/ml. The transference of L. pneumophila from shower water to aerosols was studied. Interviews and observational studies among the stakeholders were done in order to identify patterns of communication and behavior in a Legionella risk perspective. No substantial effects of the measures against L. pneumophila were demonstrated, except for a distally placed membrane filter. No significant positive correlation between TPC and L. pneumophila concentrations were found. L. pneumophila serogroup 2-14 was demonstrated in 21% of the 29 buildings tested in the surveillance pilot. Relatively few cells of L. pneumophila were transferred from shower water to aerosols. Anxiety appeared as the major driving force in the risk governance of Legionella. In conclusion, the risk of acquiring Legionnaires' disease from municipal shower systems is evaluated as low and uncertain. By eliminating ineffective approaches, targeted Legionella risk governance can be practiced. Risk management by surveillance is evaluated as appropriate.","['Wiik R', 'Krøvel AV']",2014,9,12,PLoS One,Wiik R and Krøvel AV.

25488819,Soluble NSF attachment protein receptor molecular mimicry by a Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm effector.,"Upon infection, Legionella pneumophila uses the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system to translocate effector proteins from the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) into the host cell cytoplasm. The effectors target a wide array of host cellular processes that aid LCV biogenesis, including the manipulation of membrane trafficking. In this study, we used a hidden Markov model screen to identify two novel, non-eukaryotic soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) homologs: the bacterial Legionella SNARE effector A (LseA) and viral SNARE homolog A proteins. We characterized LseA as a Dot/Icm effector of L. pneumophila, which has close homology to the Qc-SNARE subfamily. The lseA gene was present in multiple sequenced L. pneumophila strains including Corby and was well distributed among L. pneumophila clinical and environmental isolates. Employing a variety of biochemical, cell biological and microbiological techniques, we found that farnesylated LseA localized to membranes associated with the Golgi complex in mammalian cells and LseA interacted with a subset of Qa-, Qb- and R-SNAREs in host cells. Our results suggested that LseA acts as a SNARE protein and has the potential to regulate or mediate membrane fusion events in Golgi-associated pathways.","['King NP', 'Newton P', 'Schuelein R', 'Brown DL', 'Petru M', 'Zarsky V', 'Dolezal P', 'Luo L', 'Bugarcic A', 'Stanley AC', 'Murray RZ', 'Collins BM', 'Teasdale RD', 'Hartland EL', 'Stow JL']",2015,17,6,Cell Microbiol,"King NP, et al.

Infection control should include preventive measures to reduce the risk of waterborne infection. The efficiency of point-of-use water filters in infection control was assessed in the intensive care unit of a Hungarian hospital with long history of nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa cases. All taps in the unit were fitted with disposable point-of-use filters. The incidence of nosocomial P. aeruginosa infections decreased from 2.71 to 0 cases/100 patient days when the filters were in place. Legionnaires' disease was not observed either during or outside the study period. Before the application of the filters, both P. aeruginosa and Legionella sp. were shown to colonize five of the seven taps. Filtration eliminated both bacteria completely, though secondary contamination was observed. Total genome restriction profiling of environmental and clinical P. aeruginosa isolates have shown the ubiquitous presence of a single genotype. The same genotype was detected in five of the seven previous nosocomial cases, which supports the assumption of water-derived infection. The results demonstrate that point-of-use filters are effective and cost-efficient measures in reducing health-care associated infections.","['Barna Z', 'Antmann K', 'Pászti J', 'Bánfi R', 'Kádár M', 'Szax A', 'Németh M', 'Szegő E', 'Vargha M']",2014,12,4,J Water Health,"Barna Z, et al.

25473976,Minimum inhibitory concentration distribution in environmental Legionella spp. isolates.,"In Greece standard tests are performed in the watering and cooling systems of hotels' units either as part of the surveillance scheme or following human infection. The purpose of this study was to establish the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions of environmental Legionella isolates for six antimicrobials commonly used for the treatment of Legionella infections, by MIC-test methodology. Water samples were collected from 2004 to 2011 from 124 hotels from the four prefectures of Crete (Greece). Sixty-eight (68) Legionella isolates, comprising L. pneumophila serogroups 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 15, L. anisa, L. rubrilucens, L. maceachernii, L. quinlivanii, L. oakridgensis, and L. taurinensis, were included in the study. MIC-tests were performed on buffered charcoal yeast extract with α-ketoglutarate, L-cysteine, and ferric pyrophosphate. The MICs were read after 2 days of incubation at 36 ± 1 °C at 2.5% CO2. A large distribution in MICs was recorded for each species and each antibiotic tested. Rifampicin proved to be the most potent antibiotic regardless of the Legionella spp.; tetracycline appeared to have the least activity on our environmental isolates. The MIC-test approach is an easy, although not so cost-effective, way to determine MICs in Legionella spp. These data should be kept in mind especially since these Legionella species may cause human disease.","['Sandalakis V', 'Chochlakis D', 'Goniotakis I', 'Tselentis Y', 'Psaroulaki A']",2014,12,4,J Water Health,"Sandalakis V, et al.

Although multiplying in endoplasmic reticulum-derived vacuoles, they cause no cell death, suggesting subtle but efficient use of host resources. Brucellae are amino-acid prototrophs able to grow with ammonium or use glutamate as the sole carbon-nitrogen source in vitro. They contain more than twice amino acid/peptide/polyamine uptake genes than the amino-acid auxotroph Legionella pneumophila, which multiplies in a similar vacuole, suggesting a different nutritional strategy. During these two last decades, many mutants of key actors in nitrogen metabolism (transporters, enzymes, regulators, etc.) have been described to be essential for full virulence of brucellae. Here, we review the genomic and experimental data on Brucella nitrogen metabolism and its connection with virulence. An analysis of various aspects of this metabolism (transport, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism, respiration and regulation) has highlighted differences and similarities in nitrogen metabolism with other α-Proteobacteria. Together, these data suggest that, during their intracellular life cycle, the brucellae use various nitrogen sources for biosynthesis, catabolism and respiration following a strategy that requires prototrophy and a tight regulation of nitrogen use.","['Ronneau S', 'Moussa S', 'Barbier T', 'Conde-Álvarez R', 'Zuniga-Ripa A', 'Moriyon I', 'Letesson JJ']",2016,42,4,Crit Rev Microbiol,"Ronneau S, et al.

25469776,A new oligonucleotide microarray for detection of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Legionella spp.,"Legionella pneumophila has been recognized as the major cause of legionellosis since the discovery of the deadly disease. Legionella spp. other than L. pneumophila were later found to be responsible to many non-pneumophila infections. The non-L. pneumophila infections are likely under-detected because of a lack of effective diagnosis. In this report, we have sequenced the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of 10 Legionella species and subspecies, including L. anisa, L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, L. fairfieldensis, L. gormanii, L. jordanis, L. maceachernii, L. micdadei, L. pneumophila subspp. fraseri and L. pneumophila subspp. pasculleii, and developed a rapid oligonucleotide microarray detection technique accordingly to identify 12 most common Legionella spp., which consist of 11 pathogenic species of L. anisa, L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, L. gormanii, L. jordanis, L. longbeachae, L. maceachernii, L. micdadei, and L. pneumophila (including subspp. pneumophila, subspp. fraseri, and subspp. pasculleii) and one non-pathogenic species, L. fairfieldensis. Twenty-nine probes that reproducibly detected multiple Legionella species with high specificity were included in the array. A total of 52 strains, including 30 target pathogens and 22 non-target bacteria, were used to verify the oligonucleotide microarray assay. The sensitivity of the detection was at 1.0 ng with genomic DNA or 13 CFU/100 mL with Legionella cultures. The microarray detected seven samples of air conditioner-condensed water with 100% accuracy, validating the technique as a promising method for applications in basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

25461576,Post-modern pathogens: surprising activities of translocated effectors from E. coli and Legionella.,"Many bacterial pathogens have the ability to manipulate cellular processes and interfere with host cell function through the translocation of bacterial 'effector' proteins. Dedicated protein secretion machines from Gram-negative pathogens, including type III, type IV and type VI secretion systems, inject virulence proteins into infected cells, altering normal cell physiology, including cell structure, metabolism, trafficking and signalling. While effectors were once thought to exert an effect simply by their localization and binding to host cell proteins, increasingly effectors are being recognised as enzymes, in some cases mediating highly novel post-translational modifications on host proteins.

25461091,Vectorial role of Acanthamoeba in Legionella propagation in water for human use.,"Legionella spp. is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease and is transmitted through aerosols emanating from man-made water systems. Legionella resistance to water treatments has been related to its association with environmental amoebae such as Acanthamoeba. Due to the high presence of this protozoon in Spain and the high rate of notification of Legionnaires' disease of this country, the aims of this work were to study the coexistence of these bacteria and protozoa in water as well as their interaction. The usefulness of Acanthamoeba co-culture for the isolation of environmental Legionella was also studied. For this purpose, 70 water samples were collected in 2011 from three Drinking Water Treatment Plants, three Wastewater Treatment Plants and five Natural Pools in Spain. Acanthamoeba was found by PCR in 87.1% (61/70) samples and, by culture in 85.7% (60/70) samples. Legionella was detected by PCR in 58.6% (41/70) of water samples, in 5.7% (4/70) by agar culture and 75.7% (53/70) by Acanthamoeba co-culture. From the 54 Acanthamoeba water isolates, Legionella was detected in 43 of them independently of Acanthamoeba's genotype (T3, T4 and T11). Legionella feeleii, Legionella birminghamiensis, Legionella gresilensis/berliardensis, Legionella fairfieldensis, Legionella drozanski and Legionella falloni were identified. In conclusion, our results showed that environmental Acanthamoeba is infected by Legionella to a high percentage, and due to its ubiquity, high resistance and its pathogenic potential per se, new methods for its elimination should be studied. Also, the high effectivity of Acanthamoeba co-culture for Legionella detection has been shown.","['Magnet A', 'Peralta RH', 'Gomes TS', 'Izquierdo F', 'Fernandez-Vadillo C', 'Galvan AL', 'Pozuelo MJ', 'Pelaz C', 'Fenoy S', 'Del Águila C']",2015,505,,Sci Total Environ,"Magnet A, et al.

25449315,Crystal structure of Legionella pneumophila dephospho-CoA kinase reveals a non-canonical conformation of P-loop.,"Dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK; EC 2.7.1.24) catalyzes the final step in the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway. DPCK transfers a phosphate group from ATP to the 3-hydroxyl group of the ribose of dephosphocoenzyme A (dCoA) to yield CoA and ADP. Upon the binding of ligands, large conformational changes is induced in DPCKs, as well as in many other kinases, to shield the bound ATP in their catalytic site from the futile hydrolysis by bulk water molecules. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the phosphoryl transfer during DPCK catalytic cycle, we determined the crystal structures of the Legionellapneumophila DPCK (LpDPCK) both in its apo-form and in complex with ATP. The structures reveal that LpDPCK comprises of three domains, the classical core domain, the CoA domain, and the LID domain, which are packed together to create a central cavity for substrate-binding and enzymatic catalysis. The binding of ATP induces large conformational changes, including a hinge-bending motion of the CoA binding domain and the ""helix to loop"" conformational change of the P-loop. Finally, modeling of a dCoA molecule to the enzyme provides insights into the catalytic mechanism of DPCK.","['Gong X', 'Chen X', 'Yu D', 'Zhang N', 'Zhu Z', 'Niu L', 'Mao Y', 'Ge H']",2014,188,3,J Struct Biol,"Gong X, et al.

25445671,The YhhN protein of Legionella pneumophila is a Lysoplasmalogenase.,"Lysoplasmalogenase catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of the vinyl-ether bond of lysoplasmalogen to yield fatty aldehyde and glycerophospho-ethanolamine or glycerophospho-choline. We recently purified lysoplasmalogenase from rat liver microsomes and identified the protein as TMEM86B, an integral membrane protein that is a member of the YhhN family found in numerous species of eukaryotes and bacteria. To test the hypothesis that bacterial YhhN proteins also function as lysoplasmalogenase enzymes, we cloned the Lpg1991 gene of Legionella pneumophila, which encodes a 216 amino acid YhhN protein (LpYhhN), and expressed it in Escherichia coli as a C-terminal-GFP-His8-fusion. Membranes were solubilized and the fusion protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, cleaved with Tobacco Etch Virus protease, and subjected to a reverse nickel column to purify the un-tagged LpYhhN. Both the fusion protein and un-tagged LpYhhN exhibit robust lysoplasmalogenase activity, cleaving the vinyl-ether bond of lysoplasmalogen with a Vmax of 12 µmol/min/mg protein and a Km of 45 μM. LpYhhN has no activity on diradyl plasmalogen, 1-alkenyl-glycerol, and monoacylglycerophospho-ethanolamine or monoacylglycerophospho-choline; the pH optimum is 6.5-7.0. These properties are very similar to mammalian TMEM86B. Sequence analysis suggests that YhhN proteins contain eight transmembrane helices, an N-in/C-in topology, and about 5 highly conserved amino acid residues that may form an active site. This work is the first to demonstrate a function for a bacterial YhhN protein, as a vinyl ether bond hydrolase specific for lysoplasmalogen. Since L. pneumophila does not contain endogenous plasmalogens, we hypothesize that LpYhhN may serve to protect the bacterium from lysis by lysoplasmalogen derived from plasmalogens of the host.","['Jurkowitz MS', 'Patel A', 'Wu LC', 'Krautwater A', 'Pfeiffer DR', 'Bell CE']",2015,1848,2,Biochim Biophys Acta,"Jurkowitz MS, et al.

These isolates were assigned into 53 sequence types (STs) (50 STs with seven loci data and three unidentified STs with incomplete loci profiles) with ST1 as the dominant one (14.5%), and the index of diversity (IOD) was 0.950. Eight new alleles and 34 new STs were reported here. Notably, most of the newly identified STs with seven loci data (24/34) contained no new allele, implying frequent recombination events in L. pneumophila. Five intragenic recombination events were identified in the concatenated sequences of seven loci. The diversity of STs in natural environmental isolates (41 STs, IOD=0.956) is higher than that of artificial environmental ones (17 STs, IOD=0.824). The ST patterns varied in isolates from these two sources: the most common STs from artificial water sources, ST1 and ST752 (39.2% and 13.7%), were only occasionally isolated from natural water sources (2.9% and 3.8%, respectively); while the predominant STs from natural water sources, ST1048, ST739 and ST1267 (15.2%, 6.7% and 6.7%), were less frequently seen in artificial environments (2.0%, 0% and 0%, respectively). We also found out that Legionnaires' disease associated STs might be more frequently isolated in artificial environments than in natural ones. Our data revealed remarkable genetic diversity of L. pneumophila isolates from environmental water systems of Guangzhou and Jiangmen, and the different ST distribution patterns between natural water and artificial water sources as well.","['Guo J', 'Liang T', 'Hu C', 'Lv R', 'Yang X', 'Cui Y', 'Song Y', 'Yang R', 'Zhu Q', 'Song Y']",2015,29,,Infect Genet Evol,"Guo J, et al.

Overall, 43 cases were diagnosed including five deaths. Hundreds of water samples were collected for Legionella isolation but only two clinical samples were obtained. Clinical strains were ST23 as were environmental isolates detected in most Legionella-positive patients' homes and those from a public fountain. Although no Legionella was found in the municipal water mains, a continuous chlorination was applied in 2008. This action resulted in a halving of cases, although incidence remained tenfold higher than the Italian average incidence until the end of 2013, when it dropped to the expected rate. Retrospective analyses of prevalent wind direction suggested that a hidden cooling tower could have been the main cause of this uncommon outbreak, highlighting the importance of implementation of cooling tower registers in supporting LD investigations.","['Scaturro M', 'Fontana S', 'Crippa S', 'Caporali MG', 'Seyler T', 'Veschetti E', 'Villa G', 'Rota MC', 'Ricci ML']",2015,143,11,Epidemiol Infect,"Scaturro M, et al.

The eBURST algorithm was used to infer levels of relatedness between isolates. All isolates collected were Legionella pneumophila, which were further characterised into four subgroups by MAbs, and 30 sequence types (STs) by SBT. Twelve of the STs were unique to Portugal; one of them (ST100) was represented by 32 epidemiologically related isolates. The ST44 was the profile with the highest number of epidemiologically unrelated isolates. The eBURST analyses indicate that, within the group formed by the 30 STs identified in this study, 17 STs were genetically close to at least another ST in the group. The comparison between the eBURST diagrams obtained with the STs from this study and the entire SBT database of the European Working Group for Legionella, showed that 24 (seven of them unique to Portugal) of our 30 STs were related with STs identified in others countries.

25422301,Functional type 1 secretion system involved in Legionella pneumophila virulence.,"Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative pathogen found mainly in water, either in a free-living form or within infected protozoans, where it replicates. This bacterium can also infect humans by inhalation of contaminated aerosols, causing a severe form of pneumonia called legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease. The involvement of type II and IV secretion systems in the virulence of L. pneumophila is now well documented. Despite bioinformatic studies showing that a type I secretion system (T1SS) could be present in this pathogen, the functionality of this system based on the LssB, LssD, and TolC proteins has never been established. Here, we report the demonstration of the functionality of the T1SS, as well as its role in the infectious cycle of L. pneumophila. Using deletion mutants and fusion proteins, we demonstrated that the repeats-in-toxin protein RtxA is secreted through an LssB-LssD-TolC-dependent mechanism. Moreover, fluorescence monitoring and confocal microscopy showed that this T1SS is required for entry into the host cell, although it seems dispensable to the intracellular cycle. Together, these results underline the active participation of L. pneumophila, via its T1SS, in its internalization into host cells.","['Fuche F', 'Vianney A', 'Andrea C', 'Doublet P', 'Gilbert C']",2015,197,3,J Bacteriol,"Fuche F, et al.

25420390,Bus water storage tank as a reservoir of Legionella pneumophila.,"Health concerns associated with Legionnaires' disease have been identified as an area of the increasing public and professional interest. Any natural water or man-made water systems worldwide might be reservoirs of Legionellae. We presented a sporadic, community-acquired case of Legionnaires' disease caused by Legionellapneumophila serogroup 1 in a bus driver who used water for hand and face washing from a bus water storage tank. The history of any other usual place of exposure to Legionellae was negative. The water from the tank was dirty, filled with sediment and leaves, at the temperature of 22 degrees C. The water was heavily contaminated with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 isolated from each sample with the concentration of 66,000, 16,000, 42,000, 56,000 and 34,000 CFU/L. The disinfection of the bus water storage tank was made using hyperclorination with 50 mg/L of free residual chlorine. The control sampling one week after the disinfection yielded negative results. So far, there are no recommendations on regular management or disinfection of water in bus storage tanks, but it seems to be reasonable to assume that passengers as well as bus drivers may be exposed to Legionella and therefore at risk of acquiring the infection. These recommendations should include regular empting, rinsing and filling the tank with fresh tap water, at least once a week. Finally, we have to be aware that Legionella bacteria are ubiquitous and any potential mode of producing contaminated aerosol should not be overlooked during an epidemiological field investigation and proposed appropriate measures.","['Jurčev-Savičević A', 'Bradarić N', 'Paić VO', 'Mulić R', 'Puntarić D', 'Miše K']",2014,38,3,Coll Antropol,"Jurčev-Savičević A, et al.

In the present work, we studied the presence of FLP in operational man-made water systems, i.e. cooling towers (CT) and hot sanitary water systems (HSWS), related to a high risk of Legionella spp. outbreaks, as well as the effect of the biocides used, i.e. chlorine in CT and high temperature in HSWS, on FLP. In CT samples, high-chlorine concentrations (7.5 ± 1.5 mg chlorine L(-1)) reduced the presence of FLP by 63.8 % compared to samples with low-chlorine concentrations (0.04 ± 0.08 mg chlorine L(-1)). Flagellates and amoebae were observed in samples collected with a level of 8 mg chlorine L(-1), which would indicate that some FLP, including the free-living amoeba (FLA) Acanthamoeba spp., are resistant to the discontinuous chlorine disinfection method used in the CT studied. Regarding HSWS samples, the amount of FLP detected in high-temperatures samples (53.1 ± 5.7 °C) was 38 % lower than in low-temperature samples (27.8 ± 5.8 °C). The effect of high temperature on FLP was chiefly observed in the results obtained by the culture method, in which there was a clear reduction in the presence of FLP at temperatures higher than 50 °C, but not in those obtained by PCR. The findings presented here show that the presence of FLP in operational man-made water systems should be taken into account in future regulations.","['Canals O', 'Serrano-Suárez A', 'Salvadó H', 'Méndez J', 'Cervero-Aragó S', 'Ruiz de Porras V', 'Dellundé J', 'Araujo R']",2015,22,9,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,"Canals O, et al.

AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, β-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies.

25381242,Exposure to synthetic gray water inhibits amoeba encystation and alters expression of Legionella pneumophila virulence genes.,"Water conservation efforts have focused on gray water (GW) usage, especially for applications that do not require potable water quality. However, there is a need to better understand environmental pathogens and their free-living amoeba (FLA) hosts within GW, given their growth potential in stored gray water. Using synthetic gray water (sGW) we examined three strains of the water-based pathogen Legionella pneumophila and its FLA hosts Acanthamoeba polyphaga, A. castellanii, and Vermamoeba vermiformis. Exposure to sGW for 72 h resulted in significant inhibition (P < 0.0001) of amoebal encystation versus control-treated cells, with the following percentages of cysts in sGW versus controls: A. polyphaga (0.6 versus 6%), A. castellanii (2 versus 62%), and V. vermiformis (1 versus 92%), suggesting sGW induced maintenance of the actively feeding trophozoite form. During sGW exposure, L. pneumophila culturability decreased as early as 5 h (1.3 to 2.9 log10 CFU, P < 0.001) compared to controls (Δ0 to 0.1 log10 CFU) with flow cytometric analysis revealing immediate changes in membrane permeability. Furthermore, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed on total RNA isolated from L. pneumophila cells at 0 to 48 h after sGW incubation, and genes associated with virulence (gacA, lirR, csrA, pla, and sidF), the type IV secretion system (lvrB and lvrE), and metabolism (ccmF and lolA) were all shown to be differentially expressed. These results suggest that conditions within GW may promote interactions between water-based pathogens and FLA hosts, through amoebal encystment inhibition and alteration of bacterial gene expression, thus warranting further exploration into FLA and L. pneumophila behavior in GW systems.","['Buse HY', 'Lu J', 'Ashbolt NJ']",2015,81,2,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Buse HY, et al.

25381233,Aerosolization of respirable droplets from a domestic spa pool and the use of MS-2 coliphage and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as markers for Legionella pneumophila.,"Legionnaires' disease can result when droplets or aerosols containing legionella bacteria are inhaled and deposited in the lungs. A number of outbreaks have been associated with the use of a spa pool where aeration, a high water temperature, and a large and variable organic load make disinfectant levels difficult to maintain. Spa pool ownership is increasing, and the aim of this study, using two surrogate organisms (MS-2 coliphage and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [a natural contaminant]), was to assess the potential risk to domestic users when disinfection fails. A representative ""entry level"" domestic spa pool was installed in an outdoor courtyard. The manufacturer's instructions for spa pool maintenance were not followed. A cyclone sampler was used to sample the aerosols released from the spa pool with and without activation of the air injection system. Samples were taken at increasing heights and distances from the pool. An aerodynamic particle sizer was used to measure the water droplet size distribution at each sample point. When the air injection system was inactivated, neither surrogate organism was recovered from the air. On activation of the air injection system, the mean mass of droplets within the respirable range (10 cm above the water line) was 36.8 μg cm(-3). This corresponded to a mean air concentration of P. aeruginosa of 350 CFU m(-3). From extrapolation from animal data, the estimated risk of infection from aerosols contaminated with similar concentrations of Legionella pneumophila was 0.76 (males) and 0.65 (females). At 1 m above and/or beyond the pool, the mean aerosol mass decreased to 0.04 μg cm(-3) and corresponded to a 100-fold reduction in mean microbial air concentration. The estimated risk of infection at this distance was negligible.","['Moore G', 'Hewitt M', 'Stevenson D', 'Walker JT', 'Bennett AM']",2015,81,2,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Moore G, et al.

25380533,Structure of L-serine dehydratase from Legionella pneumophila: novel use of the C-terminal cysteine as an intrinsic competitive inhibitor.,"Here we report the first complete structure of a bacterial Fe-S l-serine dehydratase determined to 2.25 Å resolution. The structure is of the type 2 l-serine dehydratase from Legionella pneumophila that consists of a single polypeptide chain containing a catalytic α domain and a β domain that is structurally homologous to the ""allosteric substrate binding"" or ASB domain of d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The enzyme exists as a dimer of identical subunits, with each subunit exhibiting a bilobal architecture. The [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster is bound by residues from the C-terminal α domain and is situated between this domain and the N-terminal β domain. Remarkably, the model reveals that the C-terminal cysteine residue (Cys 458), which is conserved among the type 2 l-serine dehydratases, functions as a fourth ligand to the iron-sulfur cluster producing a ""tail in mouth"" configuration. The interaction of the sulfhydryl group of Cys 458 with the fourth iron of the cluster appears to mimic the position that the substrate would adopt prior to catalysis. A number of highly conserved or invariant residues found in the β domain are clustered around the iron-sulfur center. Ser 16, Ser 17, Ser 18, and Thr 290 form hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group of Cys 458 and the carbonyl oxygen of Glu 457, whereas His 19 and His 61 are poised to potentially act as the catalytic base required for proton extraction. Mutation of His 61 produces an inactive enzyme, whereas the H19A protein variant retains substantial activity, suggesting that His 61 serves as the catalytic base. His 124 and Asn 126, found in an HXN sequence, point toward the Fe-S cluster. Mutational studies are consistent with these residues either binding a serine molecule that serves as an activator or functioning as a potential trap for Cys 458 as it moves out of the active site prior to catalysis.","['Thoden JB', 'Holden HM', 'Grant GA']",2014,53,48,Biochemistry,"Thoden JB, et al.

25370836,Comparative analyses of Legionella species identifies genetic features of strains causing Legionnaires' disease.,"BACKGROUND: The genus Legionella comprises over 60 species. However, L. pneumophila and L. longbeachae alone cause over 95% of Legionnaires’ disease. To identify the genetic bases underlying the different capacities to cause disease we sequenced and compared the genomes of L. micdadei, L. hackeliae and L. fallonii (LLAP10), which are all rarely isolated from humans.
RESULTS: We show that these Legionella species possess different virulence capacities in amoeba and macrophages, correlating with their occurrence in humans. Our comparative analysis of 11 Legionella genomes belonging to five species reveals highly heterogeneous genome content with over 60% representing species-specific genes; these comprise a complete prophage in L. micdadei, the first ever identified in a Legionella genome. Mobile elements are abundant in Legionella genomes; many encode type IV secretion systems for conjugative transfer, pointing to their importance for adaptation of the genus. The Dot/Icm secretion system is conserved, although the core set of substrates is small, as only 24 out of over 300 described Dot/Icm effector genes are present in all Legionella species. We also identified new eukaryotic motifs including thaumatin, synaptobrevin or clathrin/coatomer adaptine like domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Legionella genomes are highly dynamic due to a large mobilome mainly comprising type IV secretion systems, while a minority of core substrates is shared among the diverse species. Eukaryotic like proteins and motifs remain a hallmark of the genus Legionella. Key factors such as proteins involved in oxygen binding, iron storage, host membrane transport and certain Dot/Icm substrates are specific features of disease-related strains.","['Gomez-Valero L', 'Rusniok C', 'Rolando M', 'Neou M', 'Dervins-Ravault D', 'Demirtas J', 'Rouy Z', 'Moore RJ', 'Chen H', 'Petty NK', 'Jarraud S', 'Etienne J', 'Steinert M', 'Heuner K', 'Gribaldo S', 'Médigue C', 'Glöckner G', 'Hartland EL', 'Buchrieser C']",2014,15,11,Genome Biol,"Gomez-Valero L, et al.

25370747,Gene flow in environmental Legionella pneumophila leads to genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity within a Legionnaires' disease outbreak.,"BACKGROUND: Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by the environmental bacterium Legionella pneumophila. Outbreaks commonly affect people with known risk factors, but the genetic and pathogenic complexity of L. pneumophila within an outbreak is not well understood. Here, we investigate the etiology of the major Legionnaires' disease outbreak that occurred in Edinburgh, UK, in 2012, by examining the evolutionary history, genome content, and virulence of L. pneumophila clinical isolates.
RESULTS: Our high resolution genomic approach reveals that the outbreak was caused by multiple genetic subtypes of L. pneumophila, the majority of which had diversified from a single progenitor through mutation, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer within an environmental reservoir prior to release. In addition, we discover that some patients were infected with multiple L. pneumophila subtypes, a finding which can affect the certainty of source attribution. Importantly, variation in the complement of type IV secretion systems encoded by different genetic subtypes correlates with virulence in a Galleria mellonella model of infection, revealing variation in pathogenic potential among the outbreak source population of L. pneumophila.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study indicates previously cryptic levels of pathogen heterogeneity within a Legionnaires' disease outbreak, a discovery that impacts on source attribution for future outbreak investigations. Furthermore, our data suggest that in addition to host immune status, pathogen diversity may be an important influence on the clinical outcome of individual outbreak infections.","['McAdam PR', 'Vander Broek CW', 'Lindsay DS', 'Ward MJ', 'Hanson MF', 'Gillies M', 'Watson M', 'Stevens JM', 'Edwards GF', 'Fitzgerald JR']",2014,15,11,Genome Biol,"McAdam PR, et al.

25369898,Complete and ubiquitinated proteome of the Legionella-containing vacuole within human macrophages.,"Within protozoa or human macrophages Legionella pneumophila evades the endosomal pathway and replicates within an ER-derived vacuole termed the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). The LCV membrane-localized AnkB effector of L. pneumophila is an F-box protein that mediates decoration of the LCV with lysine(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins, which is essential for intravacuolar replication. Using high-throughput LC-MS analysis, we have identified the total and ubiquitinated host-derived proteome of LCVs purified from human U937 macrophages. The LCVs harboring the AA100/130b WT strain contain 1193 proteins including 24 ubiquitinated proteins, while the ankB mutant LCVs contain 1546 proteins with 29 ubiquitinated proteins. Pathway analyses reveal the enrichment of proteins involved in signaling, protein transport, phosphatidylinositol, and carbohydrate metabolism on both WT and ankB mutant LCVs. The ankB mutant LCVs are preferentially enriched for proteins involved in transcription/translation and immune responses. Ubiquitinated proteins on the WT strain LCVs are enriched for immune response, signaling, regulation, intracellular trafficking, and amino acid transport pathways, while ubiquitinated proteins on the ankB mutant LCVs are enriched for vesicle trafficking, signaling, and ubiquitination pathways. The complete and ubiquitinated LCV proteome within human macrophages illustrates complex and dynamic biogenesis of the LCV and provides a rich resource for future studies.","['Bruckert WM', 'Abu Kwaik Y']",2015,14,1,J Proteome Res,Bruckert WM and Abu Kwaik Y.

25363599,Fusion of Legionella pneumophila outer membrane vesicles with eukaryotic membrane systems is a mechanism to deliver pathogen factors to host cell membranes.,"The formation and release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) is a phenomenon observed in many bacteria, including Legionella pneumophila. During infection, this human pathogen primarily invades alveolar macrophages and replicates within a unique membrane-bound compartment termed Legionella-containing vacuole. In the current study, we analysed the membrane architecture of L. pneumophila OMVs by small-angle X-ray scattering and biophysically characterized OMV membranes. We investigated the interaction of L. pneumophila OMVs with model membranes by Förster resonance energy transfer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These experiments demonstrated the incorporation of OMV membrane material into liposomes composed of different eukaryotic phospholipids, revealing an endogenous property of OMVs to fuse with eukaryotic membranes. Cellular co-incubation experiments showed a dose- and time-dependent binding of fluorophore-labelled OMVs to macrophages. Trypan blue quenching experiments disclosed a rapid internalization of OMVs into macrophages at 37 and 4 °C. Purified OMVs induced tumour necrosis factor-α production in human macrophages at concentrations starting at 300 ng ml(-1). Experiments on HEK293-TLR2 and TLR4/MD-2 cell lines demonstrated a dominance of TLR2-dependent signalling pathways. In summary, we demonstrate binding, internalization and biological activity of L. pneumophila OMVs on human macrophages. Our data support OMV membrane fusion as a mechanism for the remote delivery of virulence factors to host cells.","['Jäger J', 'Keese S', 'Roessle M', 'Steinert M', 'Schromm AB']",2015,17,5,Cell Microbiol,"Jäger J, et al.

We report an unusual bronchoscopy-related pseudo-outbreak due to Actinomyces graevenitzii. Extensive epidemiological and microbiological investigation failed to identify a common source. Strain typing revealed that the cluster was comprised of heterogeneous strains of A. graevenitzii. A change in laboratory procedures for Actinomyces cultures was coincident with the emergence of the pseudo-outbreak, and we determined that A. graevenitzii isolates more readily adopted a white, dry, molar tooth appearance on anaerobic colistin nalidixic acid (CNA) agar which likely facilitated its detection and identification in bronchoscopic specimens. This unusual pseudo-outbreak was related to frequent requests of bronchoscopists for Actinomyces cultures combined with a change in microbiology laboratory practices.","['Peaper DR', 'Havill NL', 'Aniskiewicz M', 'Callan D', 'Pop O', 'Towle D', 'Boyce JM']",2015,53,1,J Clin Microbiol,"Peaper DR, et al.

25339545,Diversity of bacterial manipulation of the host ubiquitin pathways.,"Ubiquitination is generally considered as a eukaryotic protein modification, which is catalysed by a three-enzyme cascade and is reversed by deubiquitinating enzymes. Ubiquitination directs protein degradation and regulates cell signalling, thereby plays key roles in many cellular processes including immune response, vesicle trafficking and cell cycle. Bacterial pathogens inject a series of virulent proteins, named effectors, into the host cells. Increasing evidence suggests that many effectors hijack the host ubiquitin pathways to benefit bacterial infection. This review summarizes the known functions and mechanisms of effectors from human bacterial pathogens including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Chlamydia and Legionella, highlighting the diversity in their mechanisms for manipulating the host ubiquitin pathways. Many effectors adopt the molecular mimicry strategy to harbour similar structures or functional motifs with those of the host E3 ligases and deubiquitinases. On the other hand, a few of effectors evolve novel structures or new enzymatic activities to modulate various steps of the host ubiquitin pathways. The diversity in the mechanisms enhances the efficient exploitation of the host ubiquitination signalling by bacteria.","['Zhou Y', 'Zhu Y']",2015,17,1,Cell Microbiol,Zhou Y and Zhu Y.

25339170,A type IV translocated Legionella cysteine phytase counteracts intracellular growth restriction by phytate.,"The causative agent of Legionnaires' pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, colonizes diverse environmental niches, including biofilms, plant material, and protozoa. In these habitats, myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate) is prevalent and used as a phosphate storage compound or as a siderophore. L. pneumophila replicates in protozoa and mammalian phagocytes within a unique ""Legionella-containing vacuole."" The bacteria govern host cell interactions through the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system (T4SS) and ∼300 different ""effector"" proteins. Here we characterize a hitherto unrecognized Icm/Dot substrate, LppA, as a phytate phosphatase (phytase). Phytase activity of recombinant LppA required catalytically essential cysteine (Cys(231)) and arginine (Arg(237)) residues. The structure of LppA at 1.4 Å resolution revealed a mainly α-helical globular protein stabilized by four antiparallel β-sheets that binds two phosphate moieties. The phosphates localize to a P-loop active site characteristic of dual specificity phosphatases or to a non-catalytic site, respectively. Phytate reversibly abolished growth of L. pneumophila in broth, and growth inhibition was relieved by overproduction of LppA or by metal ion titration. L. pneumophila lacking lppA replicated less efficiently in phytate-loaded Acanthamoeba castellanii or Dictyostelium discoideum, and the intracellular growth defect was complemented by the phytase gene. These findings identify the chelator phytate as an intracellular bacteriostatic component of cell-autonomous host immunity and reveal a T4SS-translocated L. pneumophila phytase that counteracts intracellular bacterial growth restriction by phytate. Thus, bacterial phytases might represent therapeutic targets to combat intracellular pathogens.","['Weber S', 'Stirnimann CU', 'Wieser M', 'Frey D', 'Meier R', 'Engelhardt S', 'Li X', 'Capitani G', 'Kammerer RA', 'Hilbi H']",2014,289,49,J Biol Chem,"Weber S, et al.

25333430,Evaluation of a new monochloramine generation system for controlling Legionella in building hot water systems.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a new monochloramine generation system for control of Legionella in a hospital hot water distribution system.
SETTING: A 495-bed tertiary care hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The hospital has 12 floors covering approximately 78,000 m(2).
METHODS: The hospital hot water system was monitored for a total of 29 months, including a 5-month baseline sampling period prior to installation of the monochloramine system and 24 months of surveillance after system installation (postdisinfection period). Water samples were collected for microbiological analysis (Legionella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter species, nitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic plate count [HPC] bacteria, and nontuberculous mycobacteria). Chemical parameters monitored during the investigation included monochloramine, chlorine (free and total), nitrate, nitrite, total ammonia, copper, silver, lead, and pH.
RESULTS: A significant reduction in Legionella distal site positivity was observed between the pre- and postdisinfection periods, with positivity decreasing from an average of 53% (baseline) to an average of 9% after monochloramine application (P<0.5]). Although geometric mean HPC concentrations decreased by approximately 2 log colony-forming units per milliliter during monochloramine treatment, we did not observe significant changes in other microbial populations.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evaluation in the United States of a commercially available monochloramine system installed on a hospital hot water system for Legionella disinfection, and it demonstrated a significant reduction in Legionella colonization. Significant increases in microbial populations or other negative effects previously associated with monochloramine use in large municipal cold water systems were not observed.","['Duda S', 'Kandiah S', 'Stout JE', 'Baron JL', 'Yassin M', 'Fabrizio M', 'Ferrelli J', 'Hariri R', 'Wagener MM', 'Goepfert J', 'Bond J', 'Hannigan J', 'Rogers D']",2014,35,11,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,"Duda S, et al.

25308933,Endoscopy supply water and final rinse testing: five years of experience.,"BACKGROUND: The penultimate stage in endoscope reprocessing is the final rinse with water following terminal disinfection. This requires a degree of microbiological and chemical control of the quality of the final rinse water.
AIM: To report experience gained over five years of testing, reporting and managing the quality of final rinse water for endoscopic devices.
METHODS: Three endoscope reprocessing units, each comprising five endoscope washer-disinfectors (EWDs) supplied by two reverse osmosis (RO) water units, were subjected to weekly monitoring and control of final rinse water quality. EWDs were subjected to nightly thermal self-disinfection, and RO units were subjected to periodic sanitization with peracetic acid. Final rinse water samples were processed periodically for total viable counts (TVCs), Pseudomonas spp., endotoxins, conductivity, environmental mycobacteria and Legionella spp.
FINDINGS: Over the five-year study period (2008-2013), no Pseudomonas spp., environmental mycobacteria or Legionella spp. were isolated from endoscopy rinse water. All conductivity readings were below 30 μs/cm. Endotoxin levels fluctuated over the recommended cut-off of 0.25 EU/mL, with no correlation with TVCs. Trend analysis of TVCs established alert and action limits. Apart from the supply water of one EWD becoming contaminated with Aspergillus spp., there have been no interruptions to operational capacity of the endoscope reprocessing units.
CONCLUSIONS: Quality control principles coupled with appropriate thermal and chemical disinfection of EWDs resulted in the achievement of microbiological standards for final rinse water. A co-ordinated team approach between the microbiology department, infection control department, endoscope unit managers and estates department is required to achieve this degree of success.","['Marek A', 'Smith A', 'Peat M', 'Connell A', 'Gillespie I', 'Morrison P', 'Hamilton A', 'Shaw D', 'Stewart A', 'Hamilton K', 'Smith I', 'Mead A', 'Howard P', 'Ingle D']",2014,88,4,J Hosp Infect,"Marek A, et al.

25307889,The impact of material surface roughness and temperature on the adhesion of Legionella pneumophila to contact surfaces.,"The adhesion of bacterial cells to various surfaces is based on physical and chemical interactions between the micro-organisms and the surfaces. The main purpose of this research is to determine the effect of material roughness and incubation temperature on the adhesion of bacteria. To determine the adhesion of the bacterial strain of Legionella pneumophila ATCC 33153 to the glass coupons, a spectrophotometric method of measuring the optical density of crystal violet dye that is released from pre-stained bacterial cells attached to the test surface was used. The intensity of adhesion is in positive correlation to the increase in surface roughness (p < 0.05). The adhesion is the greatest at an optimal temperature of 36 °C, whereas the temperature of 15 °C has a bacteriostatic effect and the temperature of 55 °C a bactericidal effect.","['Oder M', 'Kompare B', 'Bohinc K', 'Torkar KG']",2015,25,5,Int J Environ Health Res,"Oder M, et al.

25306486,Effect of UV irradiation (253.7 nm) on free Legionella and Legionella associated with its amoebae hosts.,"Water systems are the primary reservoir for Legionella spp., where the bacteria live in association with other microorganisms, such as free-living amoebae. A wide range of disinfection treatments have been studied to control and prevent Legionella colonization but few of them were performed considering its relation with protozoa. In this study, the effectiveness of UV irradiation (253.7 nm) using low-pressure lamps was investigated as a disinfection method for Legionella and amoebae under controlled laboratory conditions. UV treatments were applied to 5 strains of Legionella spp., 4 strains of free-living amoeba of the genera Acanthamoeba and Vermamoeba, treating separately trophozoites and cysts, and to two different co-cultures of Legionella pneumophila with the Acanthamoeba strains. No significant differences in the UV inactivation behavior were observed among Legionella strains tested which were 3 logs reduced for fluences around 45 J/m(2). UV irradiation was less effective against free-living amoebae; which in some cases required up to 990 J/m(2) to obtain the same population reduction. UV treatment was more effective against trophozoites compared to cysts; moreover, inactivation patterns were clearly different between the genus Acanthamoeba and Vermamoeba. For the first time data about Vermamoeba vermiformis UV inactivation has been reported in a study. Finally, the results showed that the association of L. pneumophila with free-living amoebae decreases the effectiveness of UV irradiation against the bacteria in a range of 1.5-2 fold. That fact demonstrates that the relations established between different microorganisms in the water systems can modify the effectiveness of the UV treatments applied.","['Cervero-Aragó S', 'Sommer R', 'Araujo RM']",2014,67,,Water Res,"Cervero-Aragó S, et al.

25299187,Intragenic recombination has a critical role on the evolution of Legionella pneumophila virulence-related effector sidJ.,"SidJ is a Dot/Icm effector involved in the trafficking or retention of ER-derived vesicles to Legionella pneumophila vacuoles whose mutation causes an observable growth defect, both in macrophage and amoeba hosts. Given the crucial role of this effector in L. pneumophila virulence we investigated the mechanisms shaping its molecular evolution. The alignment of SidJ sequences revealed several alleles with amino acid variations that may influence the protein properties. The identification of HGT events and the detection of balancing selection operating on sidJ evolution emerge as a clear result. Evidence suggests that intragenic recombination is an important strategy in the evolutionary adaptive process playing an active role on sidJ genetic plasticity. This pattern of evolution is in accordance with the life style of L. pneumophila as a broad host-range pathogen by preventing host-specialization and contributing to the resilience of the species.","['Costa J', 'Teixeira PG', ""d'Avó AF"", 'Júnior CS', 'Veríssimo A']",2014,9,10,PLoS One,"Costa J, et al.

25292115,"Legionella spp., amoebae and not-fermenting Gram negative bacteria in an Italian university hospital water system.","INTRODUCTION: In hospital and other health care facilities, contamination of water systems by potentially infectious microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa, is a source of nosocomial infections, which may originate fromcolonization of water pipes, cooling towers, spa pools, taps, showers and water supplies. Objective. The study focuses on the occurrence of Legionella spp., free-living amoebae and non-fermenting Gram-negative microorganisms in a University hospital water system located in the town of Messina (Sicily, Italy), which had never been examined previously.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2008 - March 2009, hot tap water samples were collected from 10 wards. Legionella spp. recovered on selective culture medium were identified by microagglutination latex test; free-living amoebae were cultured using Escherichia coli as a food source. Non-fermenting Gram negative microorganisms were identified by API 20 NE strips.
RESULTS: Legionella spp. were found in 33.33% of the samples. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was recovered from the Laboratory Diagnostic and Anaesthesia-Neurology Wards, with a peak of 3.5 × 10(4) cfu/L in May 2008. L. pneumophila serogroups 2-14 were found in the Othorhinolaryngology, Pathologic Anatomy, Paediatrics and Surgery Wards, and peaked (4 × 10(4) cfu/L) in April 2008. Pseudomonadaceae and Hyphomycetes were also detected. Legionella spp. were recovered from samples positive for non-pathogenic amoebae Hartmannella spp.
CONCLUSION: This first study of a Messina hospital water system suggested potential health risks related to the detection of Hartmannella spp., as reservoirs for Legionella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram negative non-fermenting bacterium frequently causing nosocomial pneumonia. The urgent need for monitoring programmes and prevention measures to ensure hospital water safety is stressed.","['Laganà P', 'Caruso G', 'Piccione D', 'Gioffrè ME', 'Pino R', 'Delia S']",2014,21,3,Ann Agric Environ Med,"Laganà P, et al.

25290923,[Travel-associated pneumonias].,"Respiratory infections are responsible for up to 11% of febrile infections in travellers or immigrants from tropical and subtropical regions. The main pathogens are the same as in temperate climate zones: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, influenza viruses, Legionella pneumophila. However, some pulmonary diseases can be attributed to bacterial, parasitic, viral or fungal pathogens that are endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. The most commonly imported infections are malaria, dengue, and tuberculosis. Pulmonary symptoms and eosinophilia in returning travellers and migrants may be caused by several parasitic infections such as Katayama syndrome, Loeffler syndrome, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, amebiasis, paragonimiasis, echinococcosis, and toxocariasis. In Asia, Tsutsugamushi fever is transmitted by chiggers, spotted fever rickettsiae are transmitted by ticks. Transmission of zoonotic diseases occurs mainly via contact with infected animals or their excretions, human-to-human transmission is generally rare: MERS-CoA (dromedary camels), pulmonary hantavirus infection (rodents), tularemia (rabbits and hares), leptospirosis (rats), Q-fever (sheep and goats), very rarely anthrax (hides of ruminants) and pest (infected rats and wildlife). Inhalation of contaminated dust can cause infections with dimorphic fungi: histoplasmosis (bat guano) and coccidioidomycosis in America and parts of Africa, blastomycosis in America. Some infections can cause symptoms years after a stay in tropical or subtropical regions (melioidosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary hypertension). Noninfectious respiratory diseases caused by inhalation of high amounts of air pollution or toxic dusts may also be considered.",['Geerdes-Fenge HF'],2014,68,10,Pneumologie,Geerdes-Fenge HF.

25288885,Limitations of Using Propidium Monoazide with qPCR to Discriminate between Live and Dead Legionella in Biofilm Samples.,"Accurately quantifying Legionella for regulatory purposes to protect public health is essential. Real-time PCR (qPCR) has been proposed as a better method for detecting and enumerating Legionella in samples than conventional culture method. However, since qPCR amplifies any target DNA in the sample, the technique's inability to discriminate between live and dead cells means that counts are generally significantly overestimated. Propidium monoazide (PMA) has been used successfully in qPCR to aid live/dead discrimination. We tested PMA use as a method to count only live Legionella cells in samples collected from a modified chemostat that generates environmentally comparable samples. Counts from PMA-treated samples that were pretreated with either heat or three types of disinfectants (to kill the cells) were highly variable, with the only consistent trend being the relationship between biofilm mass and numbers of Legionella cells. Two possibilities explain this result: 1. PMA treatment worked and the subsequent muted response of Legionella to disinfection treatment is a factor of biofilm/microbiological effects; although this does not account for the relationship between the amount of biofilm sampled and the viable Legionella count as determined by PMA-qPCR; or 2. PMA treatment did not work, and any measured decrease or increase in detectable Legionella is because of other factors affecting the method. This is the most likely explanation for our results, suggesting that higher concentrations of PMA might be needed to compensate for the presence of other compounds in an environmental sample or that lower amounts of biofilm need to be sampled. As PMA becomes increasingly toxic at higher concentrations and is very expensive, augmenting the method to include higher PMA concentrations is both counterproductive and cost prohibitive. Conversely, if smaller volumes of biofilm are used, the reproducibility of the method is reduced. Our results suggest that using PMA is not an appropriate method for discriminating between live and dead cells to enumerate Legionella for regulatory purposes.","['Taylor MJ', 'Bentham RH', 'Ross KE']",2014,7,,Microbiol Insights,"Taylor MJ, et al.
