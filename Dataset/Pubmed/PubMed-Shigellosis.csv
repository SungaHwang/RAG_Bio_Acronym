37679798,Production of highly immunogenic and safe Triton X-100 produced bacterial ghost vaccine against Shigella flexneri 2b serotype.,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial ghost cells (BGCs) are cells were drained of their genetic and cytoplasmic components. This work aimed to develop vaccine candidates against the Shigella flexneri (S. flexneri) 2b serotype using the BGCs approach. For the first time, (S. flexneri) 2b serotype BGCs vaccine was prepared by incubation with Triton X-100 (TX100) for only 12 h. Its safety and immunogenicity were compared to another vaccine produced using a previously used surfactant, namely Tween 80 (TW80). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cellular DNA, protein contents measurements, and ghost cell re-cultivation were used to confirm the successful generation of the BGCs. Immunogenicity was assessed through mice's intraperitoneal (IP) immunization followed by infection with S. flexneri ATCC 12022. Finally, histopathological examination was carried out.
RESULTS: Viable colony forming units (CFUs) of S. flexneri were counted from stool samples as well as homogenized colon tissues of the non-immunized challenged group. Immunized mice sera showed a significant increase in serum bactericidal activity of both preparations (TX100 = 40% and TW80 = 56%) compared to the non-immunized challenged group (positive control). The IgG levels of the bacterial ghost-vaccinated groups were four and three times greater for the TX100 and TW80 ghost vaccines, respectively, compared to that of the positive control; both bacterial ghost vaccines (BGVs) were safe and effective, according to the results of the safety check tests and histopathological analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: When comparing the BGVs prepared using TX100 and TW80 methods, the use of TX100 as a new chemical treating agent for BGC production attained robust results in terms of shorter incubation time with the targeted cells and a strong immune response against S. flexneri 2b serotype ATCC 12022 in the IP challenge test. However, a clinical study is needed to confirm the efficacy and total safety of this novel vaccine.","['Abdelfattah A', 'Samir R', 'Amin HM']",2023,15,1,Gut Pathog,"Abdelfattah A, et al.

37670042,A next-generation GMMA-based vaccine candidate to fight shigellosis.,"Shigellosis is a leading cause of diarrheal disease in low-middle-income countries (LMICs). Effective vaccines will help to reduce the disease burden, exacerbated by increasing antibiotic resistance, in the most susceptible population represented by young children. A challenge for a broadly protective vaccine against shigellosis is to cover the most epidemiologically relevant serotypes among >50 Shigella serotypes circulating worldwide. The GMMA platform has been proposed as an innovative delivery system for Shigella O-antigens, and we have developed a 4-component vaccine against S. sonnei, S. flexneri 1b, 2a and 3a identified among the most prevalent Shigella serotypes in LMICs. Driven by the immunogenicity results obtained in clinic with a first-generation mono-component vaccine, a new S. sonnei GMMA construct was generated and combined with three S. flexneri GMMA in a 4-component Alhydrogel formulation (altSonflex1-2-3). This formulation was highly immunogenic, with no evidence of negative antigenic interference in mice and rabbits. The vaccine induced bactericidal antibodies also against heterologous Shigella strains carrying O-antigens different from those included in the vaccine. The Monocyte Activation Test used to evaluate the potential reactogenicity of the vaccine formulation revealed no differences compared to the S. sonnei mono-component vaccine, shown to be safe in several clinical trials in adults. A GLP toxicology study in rabbits confirmed that the vaccine was well tolerated. The preclinical study results support the clinical evaluation of altSonflex1-2-3 in healthy populations, and a phase 1-2 clinical trial is currently ongoing.","['Rossi O', 'Citiulo F', 'Giannelli C', 'Cappelletti E', 'Gasperini G', 'Mancini F', 'Acquaviva A', 'Raso MM', 'Sollai L', 'Alfini R', 'Aruta MG', 'Vitali CG', 'Pizza M', 'Necchi F', 'Rappuoli R', 'Martin LB', 'Berlanda Scorza F', 'Colucci AM', 'Micoli F']",2023,8,1,NPJ Vaccines,"Rossi O, et al.

37580399,"Diffusible signal factors (DSFs) bind and repress VirF, the leading virulence activator of Shigella flexneri.","Shigella, the aetiological agent of human bacillary dysentery, controls the expression of its virulence determinants through an environmentally stimulated cascade of transcriptional activators. VirF is the leading activator and is essential for proper virulence expression. In this work, we report on in vitro and in vivo experiments showing that two autoinducers of the DSF family, XcDSF and BDSF interact with the jelly roll module of VirF causing its inhibition and affecting the expression of the entire virulence system of Shigella, including its ability to invade epithelial cells. We propose a molecular model explaining how the binding of XcDSF and BDSF causes inhibition of VirF by preventing its dimerization. Overall, our experimental results suggest that XcDSF and BDSF may contribute to ""colonisation resistance"" in the human gut or, alternatively, may be exploited for the fine-tuning of Shigella virulence expression as the bacterium migrates from the lumen to approach the intestinal mucosa. Our findings also stress how a detailed understanding of the interaction of DSF ligands with VirF may contribute to the rational development of innovative antivirulence drugs to treat shigellosis.","['Trirocco R', 'Pasqua M', 'Tramonti A', 'Colonna B', 'Paiardini A', 'Prosseda G']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Trirocco R, et al.

37400283,Development of Shigella conjugate vaccines targeting Shigella flexneri 2a and S. flexneri 3a using a simple platform-approach conjugation by squaric acid chemistry.,"There is a need for vaccines effective against shigella infection in young children in resource-limited areas. Protective immunity against shigella infection targets the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) component of lipopolysaccharide. Inducing immune responses to polysaccharides in young children can be problematic, but high level and durable responses can be induced by presenting polysaccharides conjugated to carrier proteins. An effective shigella vaccine will need to be multivalent, targeting the most common global species and serotypes such as Shigella flexneri 2a, S. flexneri 3a, S. flexneri 6, and S. sonnei. Here we report the development of shigella conjugate vaccines (SCV) targeting S. flexneri 2a (SCV-Sf2a) and 3a (SCV-Sf3a) using squaric acid chemistry to result in single point sun-burst type display of OSP from carrier protein rTTHc, a 52 kDa recombinant protein fragment of the heavy chain of tetanus toxoid. We confirmed structure and demonstrated that these conjugates were recognized by serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera of humans recovering from shigellosis in Bangladesh, suggesting correct immunological display of OSP. We vaccinated mice and found induction of serotype-specific OSP and LPS IgG responses, as well as rTTHc-specific IgG responses. Vaccination induced serotype-specific bactericidal antibody responses against S. flexneri, and vaccinated animals were protected against keratoconjunctivitis (Sereny test) and intraperitoneal challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2a and 3a, respectively. Our results support further development of this platform conjugation technology in the development of shigella conjugate vaccines for use in resource-limited settings.","['Kelly M', 'Mandlik A', 'Charles RC', 'Verma S', 'Calderwood SB', 'Leung DT', 'Biswas R', 'Islam K', 'Kamruzzaman M', 'Chowdhury F', 'Khanam F', 'Vann WF', 'Khan AI', 'Bhuiyan TR', 'Qadri F', 'Vortherms AR', 'Kaminski R', 'Kováč P', 'Xu P', 'Ryan ET']",2023,41,34,Vaccine,"Kelly M, et al.

37343896,Capsaicin derived from endemic chili landraces combats Shigella pathogen: Insights on intracellular inhibition mechanism.,"Ethnic tribals in northeast India have been growing and maintaining local chili landraces for ages. These chilies are known for their characteristic pungency and immense therapeutic properties. Capsaicin, a significant chili metabolite, is recognized as a natural drug for pain relief, diabetic neuropathy, psoriasis, arthritis, etc. In this study, we tried to observe the influence of locality factors on the pungency and bioactive features of Capsicum annuum L. landraces. We also checked the gastro-protective ability of these chilies, especially in the cure of shigellosis. Phytometabolite characterization and estimation were done through spectrophotometric methods. Preparative and analytical HPLC techniques were employed for extracting and purifying capsaicin-enriched fractions. Shigella flexneri growth retardation was determined through the broth dilution method. Gentamicin protection assay and ELISA were done to assess the intracellular invasion and IL-1β inflammasome production by S.flexneri. The correlation analyses postulated that phenols, flavonoids, chlorophylls, β-carotene, and capsaicin synthase upregulation strongly influenced capsaicin biosynthesis in chili cultivars. Correspondingly, the inhibitory efficacy of the HPLC-purified Balijuri-derived capsaicin was more effective than the Raja-derived capsaicin in inhibiting intracellular Shigella growth. Reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL1β) in capsaicin-treated Shigella-infected cells probably reduced inflammation-mediated intestinal damage, limiting bacterial spread. This investigation advocates the unique potential of local chilies in curing deadly 'shigellosis' with mechanistic evidence. Our observation justifies the traditional healing practices of the ethnic people of NE India.","['Das S', 'Priyadarshani N', 'Basak P', 'Maitra P', 'Bhattacharya S', 'Bhattacharya SS']",2023,181,,Microb Pathog,"Das S, et al.

37205407,Shigella O-specific polysaccharide functional IgA responses mediate protection against shigella infection in an endemic high-burden setting.,"Shigella is the second leading cause of diarrheal disease-related death in young children in low and middle income countries. The mechanism of protection against shigella infection and disease in endemic areas is uncertain. While historically LPS-specific IgG titers have been associated with protection in endemic settings, emerging deeper immune approaches have recently elucidated a protective role for IpaB-specific antibody responses in a controlled human challenge model in North American volunteers. To deeply interrogate potential correlates of immunity in areas endemic for shigellosis, here we applied a systems approach to analyze the serological response to shigella across endemic and non-endemic populations. Additionally, we analyzed shigella-specific antibody responses over time in the context of endemic resistance or breakthrough infections in a high shigella burden location. Individuals with endemic exposure to shigella possessed broad and functional antibody responses across both glycolipid and protein antigens compared to individuals from non-endemic regions. In high shigella burden settings, elevated levels of OSP-specific FcαR binding antibodies were associated with resistance to shigellosis. OSP-specific FcαR binding IgA found in resistant individuals activated bactericidal neutrophil functions including phagocytosis, degranulation and reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, IgA depletion from resistant serum significantly reduced binding of OSP-specific antibodies to FcαR and antibody mediated activation of neutrophils and monocytes. Overall, our findings suggest that OSP-specific functional IgA responses contribute to protective immunity against shigella infection in high-burden settings. These findings will assist in the development and evaluation of shigella vaccines.","['Bernshtein B', 'Kelly M', 'Cizmeci D', 'Zhiteneva JA', 'Macvicar R', 'Kamruzzaman M', 'Bhuiyan TR', 'Chowdhury F', 'Khan AI', 'Qadri F', 'Charles RC', 'Xu P', 'Kováč P', 'Kaminski RW', 'Alter G', 'Ryan ET']",2023,,,bioRxiv,"Bernshtein B, et al.

37161932,An automated microscopy workflow to study Shigella-neutrophil interactions and antibiotic efficacy in vivo.,"Shigella are Gram-negative bacterial pathogens responsible for bacillary dysentery (also called shigellosis). The absence of a licensed vaccine and widespread emergence of antibiotic resistance has led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to highlight Shigella as a priority pathogen requiring urgent attention. Several infection models have been useful to explore the Shigella infection process; yet, we still lack information regarding events taking place in vivo. Here, using a Shigella-zebrafish infection model and high-content microscopy, we developed an automated microscopy workflow to non-invasively study fluorescently labelled bacteria and neutrophils in vivo. We applied our workflow to antibiotic-treated zebrafish, and demonstrate that antibiotics reduce bacterial burden and not neutrophil recruitment to the hindbrain ventricle. We discovered that nalidixic acid (a bactericidal antibiotic) can work with leukocytes in an additive manner to control Shigella flexneri infection and can also restrict dissemination of Shigella sonnei from the hindbrain ventricle.

37150086,Network pharmacology and molecular docking combined with widely targeted metabolomics to elucidate the potential compounds and targets of Euphorbia helioscopia seeds for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.,"BACKGROUND: The whole herb of Euphorbia helioscopia has been traditionally used for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, malaria, warts, lung cancer and bacillary dysentery for a long time in China. However, E. helioscopia seeds are often discarded and its medicinal value is often ignored, resulting in a waste of resources.
METHOD: In this work, widely targeted metabolomics based on UPLC-ESI-QTRAP-MS/MS methods and metware database (MWDB) were firstly used to identify the chemical compositions of EHS. Besides, network pharmacology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were performed for elucidating the potential compounds and targets of E. helioscopia seeds for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis via common database (like TCMSP, Genecards, DAVID, STRING) and common software (like Sybyl, Cytoscape, Pymol and Schrödinger).
RESULT: The results of widely targeted metabolomics showed 231 compounds including 12 categories were identified. The highest content compositions are lipids (33.89%) followed by amino acids and derivatives (21.78%), nucleotides and derivatives (15.73%), as well as the content of functional ingredients like phenolic acids (7.33%), alkaloids (7.03%) and flavonoids (4.51%) are relatively high. Besides, the results of network pharmacology and molecular docking showed that EHS presented anti-pulmonary fibrosis medicinal value through multi-ingredients, multi-targets and multi-pathways approach. Key ingredients including 9-Hydroxy-12-oxo-15(Z)-octadecenoic acid, Nordihydrocapsiate, 1-O-Salicyl-d-glucose, 9-(Arabinosyl)hypoxanthine, Xanthosine and Galangin-7-O-glucoside. Key targets including SRC, HSP90AA1, AKT1, EGFR, JUN, EP300 and VEGFA, and key signaling pathways mainly related to AGE-RAGE, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, VEGF and HIF-1 signaling pathway. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that HSP90AA1 and 9-Hydroxy-12-oxo-15(Z)-octadecenoic complex (with the highest docking score) have a stable combination effect.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study revealed the chemical compositions of EHS and its anti-pulmonary fibrosis medicinal effect for the first time, it will provide scientific insight for the development of EHS as medicinal resource.","['Liu Y', 'Sun W', 'Shen N', 'Hao W', 'Xin H', 'Che F', 'Cui Y']",2023,160,,Comput Biol Med,"Liu Y, et al.

37074444,Shigella in Africa: New Insights From the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Study.,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the burden of Shigella spp from children aged 0-59 months with medically attended moderate-to-severe diarrhea and matched controls at sites in Mali, The Gambia, and Kenya participating in the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study from 2015 to 2018.
METHODS: Shigella spp were identified using coprocultures and serotyping in addition to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Episode-specific attributable fractions (AFe) for Shigella were calculated using Shigella DNA quantity; cases with AFe ≥0.5 were considered to have shigellosis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of Shigella was determined to be 359 of 4840 (7.4%) cases and 83 of 6213 (1.3%) controls by culture, and 1641 of 4836 (33.9%) cases and 1084 of 4846 (22.4%) controls by qPCR (cycle threshold <35); shigellosis was higher in The Gambia (30.8%) than in Mali (9.3%) and Kenya (18.7%). Bloody diarrhea attributed to Shigella was more common in 24- to 59-month-old children (50.1%) than 0- to 11-month-old infants (39.5%). The Shigella flexneri serogroup predominated among cases (67.6% of isolates), followed by Shigella sonnei (18.2%), Shigella boydii (11.8%), and Shigella dysenteriae (2.3%). The most frequent S. flexneri serotypes were 2a (40.6%), 1b (18.8%), 6 (17.5%), 3a (9.0%), and 4a (5.1%). Drug-specific resistance among 353 (98.3%) Shigella cases with AMR data was as follows: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (94.9%), ampicillin (48.4%), nalidixic acid (1.7%), ceftriaxone (0.3%), azithromycin (0.3%), and ciprofloxacin (0.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of shigellosis continues in sub-Saharan Africa.

Multidrug resistance in S. sonnei is common including against World Health Organisation recommended treatment options, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. Recently, an MSM-associated outbreak of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing, extensively drug resistant S. sonnei was reported in the United Kingdom. Here, we aimed to identify the genetic basis, evolutionary history, and international dissemination of the outbreak strain. Our genomic epidemiological analyses of 3,304 isolates from the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, France, and the United States of America revealed an internationally connected outbreak with a most recent common ancestor in 2018 carrying a low-fitness cost resistance plasmid, previously observed in travel associated sublineages of S. flexneri. Our results highlight the persistent threat of horizontally transmitted antimicrobial resistance and the value of continuing to work towards early and open international sharing of genomic surveillance data.","['Mason LCE', 'Greig DR', 'Cowley LA', 'Partridge SR', 'Martinez E', 'Blackwell GA', 'Chong CE', 'De Silva PM', 'Bengtsson RJ', 'Draper JL', 'Ginn AN', 'Sandaradura I', 'Sim EM', 'Iredell JR', 'Sintchenko V', 'Ingle DJ', 'Howden BP', 'Lefèvre S', 'Njamkepo E', 'Weill FX', 'Ceyssens PJ', 'Jenkins C', 'Baker KS']",2023,14,1,Nat Commun,"Mason LCE, et al.

In November 2021, the UK Health Security Agency detected an outbreak of 17 cases infected with the same strain of MDR extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Shigella sonnei. Phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequencing data revealed the outbreak was closely related to strains of S. sonnei isolated from travelers returning to the UK from Egypt. None of the outbreak cases reported travel and all 17 cases reported eating food from a restaurant/food outlet in the week prior to symptom onset, of which 11/17 (64.7%) ate at branches of the same national restaurant franchise. All 17 cases were adults and 14/17 (82.4%) were female. Ingredient-level analyses of the meals consumed by the cases identified spring onions as the common ingredient. Food chain investigations revealed that the spring onions served at the implicated restaurants could be traced back to a single Egyptian producer. The foodborne transmission of ESBL-producing bacteria is an emerging global health concern, and concerted action from all stakeholders is required to ensure an effective response to mitigate the risks to public health.","['Jenkins C', 'Griffith P', 'Hoban A', 'Brown C', 'Garner J', 'Bardsley M', 'Willis C', 'Jorgensen F', 'Bird M', 'Greig DR', 'Edmunds M', 'Beck C', 'Larkin L', 'Incident Management Team']",2023,86,6,J Food Prot,"Jenkins C, et al.

36973582,Identification and characterization of a novel lytic peptidoglycan transglycosylase (MltC) in Shigella dysenteriae.,"Shigellosis remains a worldwide health problem due to the lack of vaccines and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Shigella (S.) dysenteriae has rigid peptidoglycan (PG), and its tight regulation of biosynthesis and remodeling is essential for bacterial integrity. Lytic transglycosylases are highly conserved PG autolysins in bacteria that play essential roles in bacterial growth. However, their precise functions are obscure. We aimed to identify, clone, and express MltC, a unique autolysin in Escherichia (E.) coli C41 strain. The purification of recombinant MltC protein was performed using affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography methods. The PG enzymatic activity of MltC was investigated using Zymogram and Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled PG assays. Also, we aimed to detect its localization in bacterial fractions (cytoplasm and membrane) by western blot using specific polyclonal anti-MltC antibodies and its probable partners using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry applications. Purified MltC showed autolysin activity. Native MltC showed various locations in S. dysenteriae cells during different growth phases. In the Lag and early stationary phases, MltC was not found in cytoplasm and membrane fractions. However, it was detected in cytoplasm and membrane fractions during the exponential phase. In the late stationary phase, MltC was expressed in the membrane fraction only. Different candidate protein partners of MltC were identified that could be essential for bacterial growth and pathogenicity. This is the first study to suggest that MltC is indeed autolysin and could be a new drug target for the treatment of shigellosis by understanding its biological functions.","['Kadhim BA', 'Alqaseer K', 'Al-Ganahi SA']",2023,54,2,Braz J Microbiol,"Kadhim BA, et al.

36942425,[Shigellosis attended in the emergency department of a regional hospital in southeastern Spain: from their presence to multiresistance].,"OBJECTIVE: In the bacterial etiology of severe acute infectious diarrhea, except that caused by Clostridioides difficile, most of them have an invasive character and antibiotic treatment will be necessary in specific situations. Shigella is a classic pathogen, in which it is crucial to know the sensitivity to different classic and alternative antimicrobials. The objective of this work was to analyze the presence of shigellosis and the rate of antibiotic resistance.
METHODS: A descriptive-retrospective study of the reports of shigellosis of stool cultures issued between January 2016 and April 2022 was conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 34 episodes (16 -47.1%- by Shigella sonnei) were observed, as of 2018. There were only 2 pediatric cases. The overall resistance rate to azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin was 52.9%, 64.7% and 44.1%, respectively. 26.5% were resistant to the 3 groups of antibiotics. There was a higher rate of resistance for S. sonnei. The emergence of resistance to cephalosporins in recent years stands out. Episodes of multidrug-resistant shigellosis were detected between 2020 (1 by S. flexneri) and 2022 (4 by S. sonnei).
CONCLUSIONS: The episodes of shigellosis are emerging in our environment with a higher rate of multi-resistance. In this context, current empirical treatments for acute enteroinvasive enteritis are at risk of failure, if necessary.","['Rodríguez-Guerrero E', 'Herrera-León S', 'Gómez-Vicente E', 'Navarro-Marí JM', 'Gutiérrez-Fernández J']",2023,36,3,Rev Esp Quimioter,"Rodríguez-Guerrero E, et al.

36932030,Challenges and opportunities in developing a Shigella-containing combination vaccine for children in low- and middle-income countries: Report of an expert convening.,"The gram-negative bacterium Shigella is an enteric pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality due primarily to severe diarrhea and dysentery, mainly among children younger than five years of age living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Long considered a priority target for vaccine development, recent scientific advances have led to a number of promising Shigella vaccine candidates now entering advanced stages of clinical testing. Yet, there is no guarantee that even a highly efficacious Shigella vaccine will be recommended, prioritized, purchased, and widely adopted-especially if it requires additional doses in the immunization schedule and/or visits within the immunization program. This uncertainty is due to a variety of factors, including continuing declines in Shigella-specific and overall diarrheal disease mortality rates, the increasing complexity and cost of infant immunization programs in LMICs, and the recent availability of other high-priority vaccines. Since combining a Shigella vaccine with an existing infant vaccine would conceivably increase its attractiveness, there is a need to systematically consider the challenges determining the public health value, clinical development, manufacturing, licensure, policy recommendations, and financing for a Shigella-containing combination vaccine. The international non-governmental health organization PATH convened an independent panel of 34 subject matter experts across academic, industry, philanthropic, and global health sectors to discuss hypothetical combinations of a notional parenteral Shigella vaccine with three existing vaccines in order to begin exploring the challenges associated with their development. The resulting insights and recommendations from this meeting contribute to PATH's broader effort to evaluate the public health value of potential Shigella vaccines. They may also help guide future combination vaccine development efforts more broadly.","['Riddle MS', 'Louis Bourgeois A', 'Clifford A', 'Jeon S', 'Giersing BK', 'Jit M', 'Tufet Bayona M', 'Ovitt J', 'Hausdorff WP']",2023,41,16,Vaccine,"Riddle MS, et al.

A vaccine against shigellosis is in high demand. SF2a-TT15, a synthetic carbohydrate-based conjugate vaccine candidate against Shigella flexneri 2a (SF2a) was found safe and strongly immunogenic in adult volunteers. Here, SF2a-TT15 at 10 µg oligosaccharide (OS) vaccine dose is shown to induce a sustained immune response in magnitude and functionality in the majority of volunteers followed up 2 and 3 years post-vaccination. High levels of either one of the humoral parameters as well as the number of specific-IgG memory B-cells determined 3 months after vaccination were good predictors of the durability of the immune response. This study is the first to examine the long-term durability of antibody functionality and memory B-cell response induced by a Shigella vaccine candidate.","['Meron-Sudai S', 'Asato V', 'Adler A', 'Bialik A', 'Goren S', 'Ariel-Cohen O', 'Reizis A', 'Mulard LA', 'Phalipon A', 'Cohen D']",2023,8,1,NPJ Vaccines,"Meron-Sudai S, et al.

36857390,"The changing epidemiology of shigellosis in Australia, 2001-2019.","Shigellosis is an increasing cause of gastroenteritis in Australia, with prolonged outbreaks reported in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter ""First Nations"") communities and among men who have sex with men (MSM) in major cities. To determine associations between Shigella species and demographic and geographic factors, we used multivariate negative binomial regression to analyse national case notifications of shigellosis from 2001 to 2019. Between 2001 and 2019, Australian states and territories reported 18,363 shigellosis cases to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), of which age, sex and organism information were available for >99% (18,327/18,363) of cases. Of the cases included in our analysis, 42% (7,649/18,327) were S. sonnei, 29% (5,267/18,327) were S. flexneri, 1% (214/18,327) were S. boydii, less than 1% (87/18,327) were S. dysenteriae, and species information was unknown for 28% (5,110/18,327) of cases. Males accounted for 54% (9,843/18,327) of cases, and the highest proportion of cases were in children aged 0-4 years (19%; 3,562/18,327). Crude annual notification rates ranged from 2.2 cases per 100,000 in 2003 and 2011 to 12.4 cases per 100,000 in 2019. Nationally, notification rates increased from 2001 to 2019 with yearly notification rate ratios of 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.07) for S. boydii and 1.05 (95% CI 1.04-1.06) for S. sonnei. Children aged 0-4 years had the highest burden of infection for S. flexneri, S. sonnei and S. boydii; and males had a higher notification rate for S. sonnei (notification rate ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.33). First Nations Australians were disproportionately affected by shigellosis, with the notification rate in this population peaking in 2018 at 92.1 cases per 100,000 population. Over the study period, we also observed a shift in the testing method used to diagnose shigellosis, with culture independent diagnostic testing (CIDT) increasing from 2014; this also coincided with an increase in notifications of untyped Shigella. This change in testing methodology may have contributed to the observed increase in shigellosis notifications since 2014, with CIDT being more sensitive than culture dependent testing methods. The findings of this study provide important insights into the epidemiological characteristics of shigellosis in Australia, including identification of high-risk groups. This can be used to inform public health prevention and control strategies, such as targeted communication programs in First Nations communities and places with high levels of interaction between young children, such as childcare centres. Our study findings also highlight the implications of culture independent testing on shigellosis surveillance, particularly a reduction in the availability of species level information. This emphasises the continued importance of culture dependant testing for national surveillance of shigellosis.","['Ibrahim AF', 'Glass K', 'Williamson DA', 'Polkinghorne BG', 'Ingle DJ', 'Wright R', 'Kirk MD']",2023,17,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Ibrahim AF, et al.

36827347,Sensitivity and predictive value of dysentery in diagnosing shigellosis among under five children in Zambia.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella is a leading cause of bacterial diarrhea morbidity and mortality affecting mainly children under five in the developing world. In Zambia, Shigella has a high prevalence of 34.7% in children with diarrhea and an attributable fraction of 6.7% in Zambian children with moderate to severe diarrhea. Zambian diarrhea management guidelines and the health ministry reporting tool Health Management Information System (HMIS) heavily rely on the WHO clinical classification of dysentery to potentially identify and estimate the burden of Shigella in children. This reliance on clinical dysentery as a proxy to shigellosis in under five children may be resulting in gross under-estimation of shigella disease burden in Zambia.
METHODS: We used existing laboratory and clinical data to examine the sensitivity and predictive value of dysentery to correctly identify Shigella infection in under five children with PCR confirmed Shigella infection in Lusaka and Ndola districts, Zambia.
RESULTS: Clinical dysentery had a sensitivity of 8.5% (34/401) in identifying under five children with Shigella by stool PCR. Dysentery was able to correctly classify Shigella in 34 of 68 bloody stool samples giving a corresponding positive predictive value of 50%. Of the 1087 with non-bloody diarrhea, 720 did not have Shigella giving a negative predictive value of 66.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of clinical dysentery as a screening symptom for Shigella infection in children under five presenting with moderate to severe diarrhea has low sensitivity and low positive predictive value respectively. Clinical dysentery as a screening symptom for Shigella contributes to gross under diagnosis and reporting of Shigella infection among under five children in Zambia. Further research is required to better inform practice on more accurate methods or tools to use in support of routine diagnosis, particularly in low middle-income settings where laboratory diagnosis remains a challenge.","['Miti S', 'Chilyabanyama ON', 'Chisenga CC', 'Chibuye M', 'Bosomprah S', 'Mumba C', 'Chitondo S', 'Siziya S', 'Cohen D', 'Chilengi R', 'Simuyandi M']",2023,18,2,PLoS One,"Miti S, et al.

36760088,"Increasing trend of antimicrobial resistance in Shigella associated with MSM transmission in Barcelona, 2020-21: outbreak of XRD Shigella sonnei and dissemination of ESBL-producing Shigella flexneri.","BACKGROUND: Several countries have recently reported the detection of ESBL-producing Shigella sonnei associated with transmission among MSM. In a previous study by our group, 2.8% of Shigella spp. obtained from MSM in Barcelona between 2015 and 2019 were ESBL producers.
OBJECTIVES: To describe and characterize the emerging ESBL-producing Shigella spp. associated with sexual transmission among MSM detected from 2020 to 2021 in Barcelona, elucidating their connectivity with contemporaneous ESBL-producing Shigella spp. from other countries.
RESULTS: From 2020 to 2021, we identified that among MSM, 68% of S. sonnei were XDR harbouring blaCTX-M-27 and 14% of Shigella flexneri were MDR harbouring blaCTX-M-27. WGS analysis showed that the ESBL-producing S. sonnei were part of a monophyletic cluster, which included isolates responsible for the prolonged outbreak occurring in the UK. Our data also reveal the first emergence and clonal dissemination of ESBL-producing and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. flexneri 2a among MSM.
CONCLUSIONS: We report an increasing trend of antimicrobial resistance in Shigella spp. among MSM in Barcelona since 2021, mainly as a consequence of the dissemination of XDR ESBL-producing S. sonnei, previously reported in the UK. These results highlight the importance of international collaborative surveillance of MDR/XDR S. sonnei and S. flexneri for rapid identification of their emergence and the prevention of the transmission of these pathogens.","['Moreno-Mingorance A', 'Mir-Cros A', 'Goterris L', 'Rodriguez-Garrido V', 'Sulleiro E', 'Barberà MJ', 'Alberny M', 'Hoyos-Mallecot Y', 'Descalzo V', 'Bravo A', 'Roca-Grande J', 'Viñado B', 'Pumarola T', 'Larrosa MN', 'González-López JJ']",2023,78,4,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Moreno-Mingorance A, et al.

36753649,Evaluation of the impact of Shigella virulence genes on the basis of clinical features observed in patients with shigellosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Shigella continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality each year, mostly in under-five children living in developing countries. We investigated the association between Shigella virulence genes and shigellosis.
METHODOLOGY: We randomly selected 61 S. flexneri strains isolated from patients in Bangladesh between 2009 and 2013, and evaluated the presence of 140 MDa large-virulence-plasmid (p140), and 22 virulence genes including ipaH, ial, toxin, and T3SS-related genes.
RESULTS: We found p140 in 79% (n = 48) and ipaBCD in 90% (n = 55) strains, while seven strains were missing the p140. The prevalence of ial was 89%, ipgC and ipgE was 85%, and the prevalence for the remaining genes was < 85%. During the multivariate analysis, we found that instead of sen, the Shigella enterotoxin gene set along with several other virulence genes such as ipgA, icsB, ipgB1, spa15, and mxiC, were significantly influencing multiple clinical features relevant to shigellosis, including bloody stool, mucoid stool, and rectal straining.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe our model will help to determine the actual disease burden by directly looking for the genetic material in clinically suggestive patients, especially when detecting the causative organisms by traditional means is difficult.","['Chowdhury VP', 'Azmi IJ', 'Haque MA', 'Islam MR', 'Akter M', 'Mahmud S', 'Faruque ASG', 'Talukder KA']",2022,16,12,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Chowdhury VP, et al.

36736579,Consequences of Shigella infection in young children: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review of the longitudinal consequences of Shigella infection in children to inform the value proposition for an effective vaccine.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies published from January 01, 1980 to December 12, 2022 and conducted in low- and middle-income countries that included longitudinal follow-up after Shigella detection among children aged <5 years, irrespective of language. We collected data on all outcomes subsequent to Shigella detection, except mortality.
RESULTS: Of 2627 papers identified, 52 met inclusion criteria. The median sample size of children aged <5 years was 66 (range 5-2172). Data were collected in 20 countries; 56% (n = 29) of the publications included Bangladesh. The most common outcomes related to diarrhea (n = 20), linear growth (n = 14), and the mean total cost of a Shigella episode (n = 4; range: $ 6.22-31.10). Among children with Shigella diarrhea, 2.9-61.1% developed persistent diarrhea (≥14 days); the persistence was significantly more likely among children who were malnourished, had bloody stool, or had multidrug-resistant Shigella. Cumulative Shigella infections over the first 2 years of life contributed to the greatest loss in length-for-age z-score.
CONCLUSION: We identified evidence that Shigella is associated with persistent diarrhea, linear growth faltering, and economic impact to the family.","['Libby TE', 'Delawalla MLM', 'Al-Shimari F', 'MacLennan CA', 'Vannice KS', 'Pavlinac PB']",2023,129,,Int J Infect Dis,"Libby TE, et al.

36731480,"Genomic reconstruction and directed interventions in a multidrug-resistant Shigellosis outbreak in Seattle, WA, USA: a genomic surveillance study.","BACKGROUND: Shigella spp have been associated with community-wide outbreaks in urban settings. We analysed a sustained shigellosis outbreak in Seattle, WA, USA, to understand its origins and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, define ongoing transmission patterns, and optimise strategies for treatment and infection control.
METHODS: We did a retrospective study of all Shigella isolates identified from stool samples at the clinical laboratories at Harborview Medical Center and University of Washington Medical Center (Seattle, WA, USA) from May 1, 2017, to Feb 28, 2022. We characterised isolates by species identification, phenotypic susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing. Demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes of the patients were retrospectively examined.
FINDINGS: 171 cases of shigellosis were included. 78 (46%) patients were men who have sex with men (MSM), and 88 (52%) were people experiencing homelessness (PEH). Although 84 (51%) isolates were multidrug resistant, 100 (70%) of 143 patients with data on antimicrobial therapy received appropriate empirical therapy. Phylogenomic analysis identified sequential outbreaks of multiple distinct lineages of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei. Discrete clonal lineages (ten in S flexneri and nine in S sonnei) and resistance traits were responsible for infection in different at-risk populations (ie, MSM, PEH), enabling development of effective guidelines for empirical treatment. The most prevalent lineage in Seattle was probably introduced to Washington State via international travel, with subsequent domestic transmission between at-risk groups.
INTERPRETATION: An outbreak in Seattle was driven by parallel emergence of multidrug-resistant strains involving international transmission networks and domestic transmission between at-risk populations. Genomic analysis elucidated not only outbreak origin, but directed optimal approaches to testing, treatment, and public health response. Rapid diagnostics combined with detailed knowledge of local epidemiology can enable high rates of appropriate empirical therapy even in multidrug-resistant infection.

36718728,Antibiotics for Clinical Dysentery in the Pediatric Emergency Department.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical dysentery causes hundreds of thousands of deaths annually worldwide. However, current recommendations reserve antibiotics for those either clinically sick or with highly suspected cases of shigellosis. This treatment stems from rising antibiotic resistance. Children diagnosed with clinical dysentery in the pediatric emergency department (PED) are regarded more cautiously.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the use of antibiotics in children diagnosed with clinical dysentery in the PED.
METHODS: A retrospective case study of children with clinical dysentery at a single PED during the years 2015 and 2018. Demographics as well as clinical findings were compared to culture results and antibiotic treatment.
RESULTS: The study included 281 children who were diagnosed with clinical dysentery during the study period; 234 (83%) were treated with antibiotics. However, cultures were positive in only 162 cases (58%). Only 32% were Shigella spp. Younger age, fever, and leukocytosis were related to antibiotic treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of clinical dysentery is misgiven commonly in the PED leading to widespread use of antibiotics when not indicated. This treatment may impact antibiotic resistance patterns.

36710326,"Facile synthesis of multi-faceted, biomimetic and cross-protective nanoparticle-based vaccines for drug-resistant Shigella: a flexible platform technology.","BACKGROUND: No commercial vaccines are available against drug-resistant Shigella due to serotype-specific/narrow-range of protection. Nanoparticle-based biomimetic vaccines involving stable, conserved, immunogenic proteins fabricated using facile chemistries can help formulate a translatable cross-protective Shigella vaccine. Such systems can also negate cold-chain transportation/storage thus overcoming challenges prevalent in various settings.
METHODS: We explored facile development of biomimetic poly (lactide-co-glycolide)/PLGA 50:50 based nanovaccines (NVs), encapsulating conserved stabilized antigen(s)/immunostimulant of S. dysenteriae 1 origin surface-modified using simple chemistries. All encapsulants (IpaC/IpaB/LPS) and nanoparticles (NPs)-bare and modified (NV), were thoroughly characterized. Effect of IpaC on cellular uptake of NPs was assessed in-vitro. Immunogenicity of the NVs was assessed in-vivo in BALB/c mice by intranasal immunization. Cross-protective efficacy was assessed by intraperitoneally challenging the immunized groups with a high dose of heterologous S. flexneri 2a and observing for visible diarrhea, weight loss and survival. Passive-protective ability of the simplest NV was assessed in the 5-day old progeny of vaccinated mice.
RESULTS: All the antigens and immunostimulant to be encapsulated were successfully purified and found to be stable both before and after encapsulation into NPs. The ~ 300 nm sized NPs with a zeta potential of ~ - 25 mV released ~ 60% antigen by 14th day suggesting an appropriate delivery kinetics. The NPs could be successfully surface-modified with IpaC and/or CpG DNA. In vitro experiments revealed that the presence of IpaC can significantly increase cellular uptake of NPs. All NVs were found to be cytocompatible and highly immunogenic. Antibodies in sera of NV-immunized mice could recognize heterologous Shigella. Immunized sera also showed high antibody and cytokine response. The immunized groups were protected from diarrhea and weight loss with ~ 70-80% survival upon heterologous Shigella challenge. The simplest NV showed ~ 88% survival in neonates.
CONCLUSIONS: Facile formulation of biomimetic NVs can result in significant cross-protection. Further, passive protection in neonates suggest that parental immunization could protect infants, the most vulnerable group in context of Shigella infection. Non-invasive route of vaccination can also lead to greater patient compliance making it amenable for mass-immunization. Overall, our work contributes towards a yet to be reported platform technology for facile development of cross-protective Shigella vaccines.","['Baruah N', 'Ahamad N', 'Halder P', 'Koley H', 'Katti DS']",2023,21,1,J Nanobiotechnology,"Baruah N, et al.

36709320,Rapid emergence of extensively drug-resistant Shigella sonnei in France.,"Shigella sonnei, the main cause of bacillary dysentery in high-income countries, has become increasingly resistant to antibiotics. We monitored the antimicrobial susceptibility of 7121 S. sonnei isolates collected in France between 2005 and 2021. We detected a dramatic increase in the proportion of isolates simultaneously resistant to ciprofloxacin (CIP), third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) and azithromycin (AZM) from 2015. Our genomic analysis of 164 such extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates identified 13 different clusters within CIP-resistant sublineage 3.6.1, which was selected in South Asia ∼15 years ago. AZM resistance was subsequently acquired, principally through IncFII (pKSR100-like) plasmids. The last step in the development of the XDR phenotype involved various extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes (bla","['Lefèvre S', 'Njamkepo E', 'Feldman S', 'Ruckly C', 'Carle I', 'Lejay-Collin M', 'Fabre L', 'Yassine I', 'Frézal L', 'Pardos de la Gandara M', 'Fontanet A', 'Weill FX']",2023,14,1,Nat Commun,"Lefèvre S, et al.

36696935,A tetravalent Shigella outer membrane vesicles based candidate vaccine offered cross-protection against all the serogroups of Shigella in adult mice.,"In today's world and mostly in low and middle income countries, Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei remains the major causative agent of clinical bacillary dysentery. Based on contemporary epidemiology, a tetravalent Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMVs) based immunogen was formulated using the most commonly circulating Shigella strains, namely, S. flexneri 2a, S. flexneri 3a, S. flexneri 6 and S. sonnei I, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Adult BALB/c mice were orally immunized in a prime-boost-boost manner. Tetravalent Shigella OMVs immunogen induced significant and persistent serum and mucosal antibodies against OMVs, Outer Membrane Proteins (OMPs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Tetravalent OMVs also primed cell mediated immune response effectively. Protective efficacy against six heterologous Shigella strains was checked in an intra-peritoneal mouse model. Immunized mice survived lethal infection better than the non-immunized mice cohort with fewer replicating bacteria isolated from their gut. This study establishes the possibilities of tetravalent OMVs immunogen to become a potent vaccine candidate against human shigellosis, overcoming the limitations of sero-specific cross-protection of Shigella species.","['Bhaumik U', 'Halder P', 'Howlader DR', 'Banerjee S', 'Maiti S', 'Dutta S', 'Koley H']",2023,25,5,Microbes Infect,"Bhaumik U, et al.

36685876,Differential DNA methylation associated with multiple sclerosis and disease modifying treatments in an underrepresented minority population.,"Black and Hispanic American patients frequently develop earlier onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) and a more severe disease course that can be resistant to disease modifying treatments. The objectives were to identify differential methylation of genomic DNA (gDNA) associated with disease susceptibility and treatment responses in a cohort of MS patients from underrepresented minority populations. Patients with MS and controls with non-inflammatory neurologic conditions were consented and enrolled under an IRB-approved protocol. Approximately 64% of donors identified as Black or African American and 30% as White, Hispanic-Latino. Infinium MethylationEPIC bead arrays were utilized to measure epigenome-wide gDNA methylation of whole blood. Data were analyzed in the presence and absence of adjustments for unknown covariates in the dataset, some of which corresponded to disease modifying treatments. Global patterns of differential methylation associated with MS were strongest for those probes that showed relative demethylation of loci with lower M values. Pathway analysis revealed unexpected associations with shigellosis and amoebiasis. Enrichment analysis revealed an over-representation of probes in enhancer regions and an under-representation in promoters. In the presence of adjustments for covariates that included disease modifying treatments, analysis revealed 10 differentially methylated regions (DMR's) with an FDR <1E-77. Five of these genes (ARID5B, BAZ2B, RABGAP1, SFRP2, WBP1L) are associated with cancer risk and cellular differentiation and have not been previously identified in MS studies. Hierarchical cluster and multi-dimensional scaling analysis of differential DNA methylation at 147 loci within those DMR's was sufficient to differentiate MS donors from controls. In the absence of corrections for disease modifying treatments, differential methylation in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate was associated with immune regulatory pathways that regulate cytokine and chemokine signaling, axon guidance, and adherens junctions. These results demonstrate possible associations of gastrointestinal pathogens and regulation of cellular differentiation with MS susceptibility in our patient cohort. This work further suggests that analyses can be performed in the presence and absence of corrections for immune therapies. Because of their high representation in our patient cohort, these results may be of specific relevance in the regulation of disease susceptibility and treatment responses in Black and Hispanic Americans.","['Bingen JM', 'Clark LV', 'Band MR', 'Munzir I', 'Carrithers MD']",2022,13,,Front Genet,"Bingen JM, et al.

36633752,Effects of temperature on incidence of bacillary dysentery in a temperate continental arid climate city in northwest China.,"The effect of ambient temperature on health continues to draw more and more attention with the global warming. Bacillary dysentery (BD) is a major global environmental health issue and affected by temperature and other environmental variables. In the current study, we evaluated the effect of temperature on the incidence of BD from January 1st, 2008 to December 31st, 2011 in Jiayuguan, a temperate continental arid climate city in the Hexi Corridor of northwest China. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was performed to evaluate the lag effect of temperature on BD up to 30 days. Results showed the risk of BD increased with temperature significantly, especially after 8 °C. The maximum risk of BD was observed at extreme high temperature (29 °C). The effect of temperature on BD risk was significantly divided into short-term effect at lag 5 days and long-term effect at lag 30 days. Age ≤ 15 years were most affected by high temperature. The maximum cumulative risk for lag 30 days (25.8, 95% CIs: 11.8-50.1) was observed at 29 °C. Age ≤ 15 years and females showed short-term effect at lag 5 days and long-term effect at lag 30 days, while age > 15 years and males showed acute short-term effect at lag 0 and light long-term effect at lag 16 days.","['Feng F', 'Ma Y', 'Li H', 'Zhang Y', 'Cheng B', 'Wang H', 'Shen J']",2023,45,6,Environ Geochem Health,"Feng F, et al.

36626757,Asiatic acid inhibits intracellular Shigella flexneri growth by inducing antimicrobial peptide gene expression.,"AIMS: A rapid rise in resistance to conventional antibiotics for Shigella spp. has created a problem in treating shigellosis. Hence, there is an urgent need for new and non-conventional anti-bacterial agents. The aim of this study is to show how Asiatic acid, a plant-derived compound, inhibits the intracellular growth of Shigella flexneri.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Shigella flexneri sensitive and resistant strains were used for checking antimicrobial activity of Asiatic acid by gentamicin protection assay. Asiatic acid inhibited the intracellular growth of all strains. Gene expression analysis showed antimicrobial peptide (AMP) up-regulation by Asiatic acid in intestinal cells. Further western blot analysis showed that ERK, p38, and JNK are activated by Asiatic acid. ELISA was performed to check IL-8, IL-6, and cathelicidin secretion. The antibacterial effect of Asiatic acid was further verified in an in vivo mouse model.
CONCLUSIONS: The reason behind the antibacterial activities of Asiatic acid is probably over-expression of antimicrobial peptide genes. Besides, direct antimicrobial activities, antimicrobial peptides also carry immunomodulatory activities. Here, Asiatic acid increased IL-6 and IL-8 secretion to induce inflammation. Overall, Asiatic acid up-regulates antimicrobial peptide gene expression and inhibits intracellular S. flexneri growth. Moreover, Asiatic acid reduced bacterial growth and recovered intestinal tissue damages in in vivo mice model.","['Maitra P', 'Basak P', 'Okamoto K', 'Miyoshi SI', 'Dutta S', 'Bhattacharya S']",2023,134,2,J Appl Microbiol,"Maitra P, et al.

CASE PRESENTATION: A male, 23 year old, complained shorthness of breath, right chest pain, fever, and cough. Radiological examination (X-ray, CT-Scan and MRI) showed mediastinal teratoma and pleural effusion. The patient received supportive therapies, including oxygen, symptomatic therapy, antibiotics, and lateral thoracotomy. Empyema culture was positive for Shigella dysenteriae. He was discharged after thirty-six days of hospitalization in good clinical condition.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Perforation of mature teratoma is a rare but severe complication. Ruptured mediastinal teratoma can cause extensive pleural adhesions and empyema, making it challenging to perform VATS because of the risk of bleeding and damage to adjacent organs during surgery.
CONCLUSION: Ruptured mediastinal mature teratoma has a good prognosis post-surgical partial resection despite tumor attachment to the pericardium and heart.","['Ashuri M', 'Wati FF', 'Febriani A', 'Wulandari L']",2023,102,,Int J Surg Case Rep,"Ashuri M, et al.

36617579,Supplemental N-acyl homoserine lactonase alleviates intestinal disruption and improves gut microbiota in broilers challenged by Salmonella Typhimurium.,"BACKGROUND: Salmonella Typhimurium challenge causes a huge detriment to chicken production. N-acyl homoserine lactonase (AHLase), a quorum quenching enzyme, potentially inhibits the growth and virulence of Gram-negative bacteria. However, it is unknown whether AHLase can protect chickens against S. Typhimurium challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of AHLase on growth performance and intestinal health in broilers challenged by S. Typhimurium. A total of 240 one-day-old female crossbred broilers (817C) were randomly divided into 5 groups (6 replicates/group): negative control (NC), positive control (PC), and PC group supplemented with 5, 10 or 20 U/g AHLase. All birds except those in NC were challenged with S. Typhimurium from 7 to 9 days of age. All parameters related to growth and intestinal health were determined on d 10 and 14.
RESULTS: The reductions (P < 0.05) in body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) in challenged birds were alleviated by AHLase addition especially at 10 U/g. Thus, samples from NC, PC and PC plus 10 U/g AHLase group were selected for further analysis. S. Typhimurium challenge impaired (P < 0.05) intestinal morphology, elevated (P < 0.05) ileal inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-8) expression, and increased (P < 0.05) serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity on d 10. However, AHLase addition normalized these changes. Gut microbiota analysis on d 10 showed that AHLase reversed the reductions (P < 0.05) in several beneficial bacteria (e.g. Bacilli, Bacillales and Lactobacillales), along with increases (P < 0.05) in certain harmful bacteria (e.g. Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia/Shigella) in PC group. Furthermore, AHLase-induced increased beneficial bacteria and decreased harmful bacteria were basically negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with the reductions of ileal IL-1β and IL-8 expression and serum DAO activity, but positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the increased BW and ADG. Functional prediction revealed that AHLase abolished S. Typhimurium-induced upregulations (P < 0.05) of certain pathogenicity-related pathways such as lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, shigellosis, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection of gut microbiota.
CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental AHLase attenuated S. Typhimurium-induced growth retardation and intestinal disruption in broilers, which could be associated with the observed recovery of gut microbiota dysbiosis.","['Wang W', 'Ou J', 'Ye H', 'Cao Q', 'Zhang C', 'Dong Z', 'Feng D', 'Zuo J']",2023,14,1,J Anim Sci Biotechnol,"Wang W, et al.

36455742,The size of the susceptible pool differentiates climate effects on seasonal epidemics of bacillary dysentery.,"OBJECTIVES: At present, some studies have pointed out several possible climate drivers of bacillary dysentery. However, there is a complex nonlinear interaction between climate drivers and susceptible population in the spread of diseases, which makes it challenging to detect climate drivers at the size of susceptible population.
METHODS: By using empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), the climate drivers of bacillary dysentery dynamic were explored in China's five temperature zones.
RESULTS: We verified the availability of climate drivers and susceptible population size on bacillary dysentery, and used this information for bacillary dysentery dynamic prediction. Moreover, we found that their respective effects increased with the increase of temperature and relative humidity, and their states (temperature and relative humidity) were different when they reached their maximum effects, and the negative effect between the effect of temperature and disease incidence increased with the change of temperature zone (from temperate zone to warm temperate zone to subtropical zone) and the climate driving effect of the temperate zone (warm temperate zone) was greater than that of the colder (temperate zone) and warmer (subtropics) zones. When we viewed from single temperature zone, the climatic effect arose only when the size of the susceptible pool was large.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide empirical evidence that the climate factors on bacillary dysentery are nonlinear, complex but dependent on the size of susceptible populations and different climate scenarios.","['Ni H', 'Zeng Q', 'Xu T', 'Xiao L', 'Yu X', 'Hu J', 'Li Y', 'Lin H', 'Guo P', 'Zhou H']",2023,861,,Sci Total Environ,"Ni H, et al.

36409683,Antimicrobial resistance in shigellosis: A surveillance study among urban and rural children over 20 years in Bangladesh.,"Antimicrobial resistance against shigellosis is increasingly alarming. However, evidence-based knowledge gaps regarding the changing trends of shigellosis in Bangladesh exist due to the scarcity of longitudinal data on antimicrobial resistance. Our study evaluated the last 20 years antimicrobial resistance patterns against shigellosis among under-5 children in the urban and rural sites of Bangladesh. Data were extracted from the Diarrheal Disease Surveillance System (DDSS) of Dhaka Hospital (urban site) and Matlab Hospital (rural site) of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) between January 2001 and December 2020. We studied culture-confirmed shigellosis cases from urban Dhaka Hospital (n = 883) and rural Matlab Hospital (n = 1263). Since 2001, a declining percentage of shigellosis in children observed in urban and rural sites. Moreover, higher isolation rates of Shigella were found in the rural site [1263/15684 (8.1%)] compared to the urban site [883/26804 (3.3%)] in the last 20 years. In both areas, S. flexneri was the predominant species. The upward trend of S. sonnei in both the study sites was statistically significant after adjusting for age and sex. WHO-recommended 1st line antibiotic ciprofloxacin resistance gradually reached more than 70% in both the urban and rural site by 2020. In multiple logistic regression after adjusting for age and sex, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, mecillinam, ceftriaxone, and multidrug resistance (resistance to any two of these four drugs) among under-5 children were found to be increasing significantly (p<0.01) in the last 20 years in both sites. The study results underscore the importance of therapeutic interventions for shigellosis by appropriate drugs based on their current antibiogram for under-5 children. These observations may help policymakers in formulating better case management strategies for shigellosis.","['Nuzhat S', 'Das R', 'Das S', 'Islam SB', 'Palit P', 'Haque MA', 'Chakraborty S', 'Khan SH', 'Ahmed D', 'Alam B', 'Ahmed T', 'Chisti MJ', 'Faruque ASG']",2022,17,11,PLoS One,"Nuzhat S, et al.

36342937,"Estimating the burden of foodborne gastroenteritis due to nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in China.","To estimate the incidence of foodborne gastroenteritis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in China, population surveys and sentinel hospital surveillance were implemented in six provinces from July 2010 to July 2011, and a multiplier calculation model for the burden of disease was constructed. The multiplier for salmonellosis and V. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis was estimated at 4,137 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2,320-5,663], and for shigellosis at 4,356 (95% CI 2,443-5,963). Annual incidence per 100,000 population was estimated as 245 (95% CI 138-336), 67 (95% CI 38-92), and 806 (95% CI 452-1,103) for foodborne salmonellosis, shigellosis, and V. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis, respectively, indicating that foodborne infection caused by these three pathogens constitutes an important burden to the Chinese healthcare system. Continuous implementation of active surveillance of foodborne diseases, combined with multiplier models to estimate disease burden, makes it possible for us to better understand food safety status in China.","['Li YJ', 'Yang YF', 'Zhou YJ', 'Zhang RH', 'Liu CW', 'Liu H', 'Li XG', 'Chen W', 'Chen Y', 'Wu YN']",2022,17,11,PLoS One,"Li YJ, et al.

36333699,Application of logistic differential equation models for early warning of infectious diseases in Jilin Province.,"BACKGROUND: There is still a relatively serious disease burden of infectious diseases and the warning time for different infectious diseases before implementation of interventions is important. The logistic differential equation models can be used for predicting early warning of infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the disease fitting effects of the logistic differential equation (LDE) model and the generalized logistic differential equation (GLDE) model for the first time using data on multiple infectious diseases in Jilin Province and to calculate the early warning signals for different types of infectious diseases using these two models in Jilin Province to solve the disease early warning schedule for Jilin Province throughout the year.
METHODS: Collecting the incidence of 22 infectious diseases in Jilin Province, China. The LDE and GLDE models were used to calculate the recommended warning week (RWW), the epidemic acceleration week (EAW) and warning removed week (WRW) for acute infectious diseases with seasonality, respectively.
RESULTS: Five diseases were selected for analysis based on screening principles: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), shigellosis, mumps, Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and scarlet fever. The GLDE model fitted the above diseases better (0.80 ≤ R
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the LDE model, the GLDE model provides a better fit to the actual disease incidence data. The RWW appeared to be earlier when estimated with the GLDE model than the LDE model. In addition, the WRW estimated with the GLDE model were more lagged and had a longer warning time.","['Yang T', 'Wang Y', 'Yao L', 'Guo X', 'Hannah MN', 'Liu C', 'Rui J', 'Zhao Z', 'Huang J', 'Liu W', 'Deng B', 'Luo L', 'Li Z', 'Li P', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu X', 'Xu J', 'Yang M', 'Zhao Q', 'Su Y', 'Chen T']",2022,22,1,BMC Public Health,"Yang T, et al.

36331282,Burden of Shigella in South Asia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella remains one of the most common causes of diarrhoea in South Asia. Current estimates of the prevalence of Shigella are critical for guiding control measures. We estimated the prevalence of Shigella species and serogroups in South Asia.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review using PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Web of Science for peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 19 June 2022. We also manually searched the reference lists of the reviewed studies to identify additional studies. We included studies that detected the presence of Shigella in stool by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Studies associated with outbreaks were excluded. Two investigators independently reviewed the studies, extracted the data and performed quality assessment. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled prevalence of Shigella.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 5707 studies, of which 91 studies from five South Asian countries were included in the systematic review, 79 in the meta-analysis of Shigella prevalence and 63 in the meta-analysis of Shigella serogroups prevalence. The pooled prevalence of Shigella was 7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6-7%], with heterogeneity (I2 = 98.7; P < 0.01). The prevalence of Shigella was higher in children aged <5 years (10%; 95% CI: 8-11%), in rural areas (12%; 95% CI: 10-14%) and in studies using PCR (15%; 95% CI: 11-19%). Shigella flexneri (58%) was the most abundant serogroup, followed by Shigella sonnei (19%), Shigella boydii (10%) and Shigella dysenteriae (9%). Shigella flexneri 2a was the most frequently isolated serotype (36%), followed by serotype 3a (12%), serotype 6 (12%) and serotype 1b (6%). The prevalence of non-typeable Shigella was 10.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of Shigella in South Asia remains generally high, it varies by age group and geographical area, with data lacking in some countries. Effective Shigella vaccines would be advantageous for both endemic communities and travellers.","['Muzembo BA', 'Kitahara K', 'Mitra D', 'Ohno A', 'Khatiwada J', 'Dutta S', 'Miyoshi SI']",2023,30,1,J Travel Med,"Muzembo BA, et al.

36243351,Threshold protective levels of serum IgG to Shigella lipopolysaccharide: re-analysis of Shigella vaccine trials data.,"OBJECTIVES: Establishing a correlate of protection is essential for the development and licensure of Shigella vaccines. We examined potential threshold levels of serum IgG to Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that could predict protection against shigellosis.
METHODS: We performed new analyses of serologic and vaccine efficacy (VE) data from two randomized vaccine-controlled trials of the Shigella sonnei-Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant exoprotein A (rEPA) conjugate conducted in young adults and children aged 1-4 years in Israel. Adults received either S. sonnei-rEPA (n = 183) or control vaccines (n = 277). Children received the S. sonnei-rEPA conjugate (n = 1384) or S. flexneri 2a-rEPA conjugate (n = 1315). VE against culture-proven shigellosis was determined. Sera were tested for IgG anti-S. sonnei LPS antibodies. We assessed the association of various levels of IgG anti-S. sonnei LPS antibodies with S. sonnei shigellosis risk using logistic regression models and the reverse cumulative distribution of IgG levels.
RESULTS: Among adults, four vaccinees and 23 controls developed S. sonnei shigellosis; the VE was 74% (95% CI, 28-100%). A threshold of ≥1:1600 IgG anti-S. sonnei LPS titre was associated with a reduced risk of S. sonnei shigellosis and a predicted VE of 73.6% (95% CI, 65-80%). The IgG anti-S. sonnei LPS correlated with serum bactericidal titres. In children, a population-based level of 4.5 ELISA Units (EU) corresponding to 1:1072 titre, predicted VE of 63%, versus 71% observed VE in children aged 3-4 years. The predicted VE in children aged 2-4 years was 49%, consistent with the 52% observed VE.
CONCLUSION: Serum IgG anti-S. sonnei LPS threshold levels can predict the degree of VE and can be used for the evaluation of new vaccine candidates.","['Cohen D', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Schneerson R', 'Farzam N', 'Bialik A', 'Meron-Sudai S', 'Asato V', 'Goren S', 'Baran TZ', 'Muhsen K', 'Gilbert PB', 'MacLennan CA']",2023,29,3,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Cohen D, et al.

Traditional treatments for asthma have several limitations. Artificial intelligence aids in cancer treatment and may also accelerate our understanding of asthma mechanisms. We aimed to develop a new clinical diagnosis model for asthma using artificial neural networks (ANN).
METHODS: Datasets (GSE85566, GSE40576, and GSE13716) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and identified differentially expressed CpGs (DECs) enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Random forest (RF) and ANN algorithms further identified gene characteristics and built clinical models. In addition, two external validation datasets (GSE40576 and GSE137716) were used to validate the diagnostic ability of the model.
RESULTS: The methylation analysis tool (ChAMP) considered DECs that were up-regulated (

36149931,Impact of Shigella infections and inflammation early in life on child growth and school-aged cognitive outcomes: Findings from three birth cohorts over eight years.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella infections cause inflammation, which has been hypothesized to mediate the associations between Shigella and child development outcomes among children in low-resource settings. We aimed to assess whether early life inflammation and Shigella infections affect school-aged growth and cognitive outcomes from 6-8 years of age.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted follow-up assessments of anthropometry, reasoning skills, and verbal fluency in 451 children at 6-8 years of age in the Brazil, Tanzania, and South Africa sites of MAL-ED, a longitudinal birth cohort study. We estimated the associations between Shigella burden and inflammation with linear growth at 2, 5, and 6-8 years of age, and with the cognitive test scores using linear regression and adjusting for potential confounding variables. We also assessed whether inflammation mediated the associations between Shigella and school-aged outcomes using a regression-based approach to mediation analysis. A high prevalence of Shigella was associated with a 0.32 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.56) z-score lower height-for-age z-score (HAZ) at 6-8 years compared to a low prevalence of Shigella. Intestinal inflammation had a smaller association with HAZ at 6-8 years. Shigella burden had small and consistently negative associations with cognitive outcomes in Brazil and Tanzania, but not South Africa, and the estimates were not statistically significant. Systemic inflammation was strongly associated with lower verbal fluency scores in Brazil (semantic fluency z-score difference: -0.57, 95% CI: -1.05, -0.10; phonemic fluency z-score difference: -0.48, 95% CI: -0.93, -0.03). There was no evidence that intestinal inflammation mediated the association between Shigella and HAZ or cognitive outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While Shigella infections were consistently associated with long-term deficits in linear growth, the estimates of the negative associations between Shigella and cognitive outcomes were imprecise and only observed in the Brazil and Tanzania sites. Systemic inflammation was strongly associated with lower semantic and phonemic fluency scores in Brazil only, highlighting the site-specificity of effects.","['Rogawski McQuade ET', 'Scharf RJ', 'Svensen E', 'Huggins A', 'Maphula A', 'Bayo E', 'Blacy L', 'Pamplona E de Souza P', 'Costa H', 'Houpt ER', 'Bessong PO', 'Mduma ER', 'Lima AAM', 'Guerrant RL']",2022,16,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Rogawski McQuade ET, et al.

Treatment of symptomatic infections involves supportive care and antibiotic therapy, typically with an empirical choice of antibiotic.
METHODS: Twenty-four clinically ill, Shigella PCR-positive animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: single-dose ceftiofur crystalline free acid (CCFA), single-dose azithromycin gavage, a 5-day tapering azithromycin dose, or 7-day course of enrofloxacin. We hypothesized that all antimicrobial therapies would have similar efficacy.
RESULTS: Animals in all groups cleared Shigella, based on fecal PCR, and had resolution of clinical signs 2 weeks after treatment. Eight out of nine clinically ill and PCR-positive animals tested negative by fecal culture.
CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose CCFA, single-dose azithromycin, and a 5-day tapering course of azithromycin all performed as well as a 7-day course of enrofloxacin in eliminating Shigella infection.

METHODS: We recruited 127 patients with IgAN who were treatment naive and 127 matched healthy controls (HCs) who were randomly divided into discovery and validation cohorts to investigate the characteristics of their gut microbiota and establish a bacterial diagnosis model for IgAN. A separate cohort of 56 patients and HCs was investigated to assess crossregional validation. A further 40 patients with primary membranous nephropathy (MN) were enrolled to probe disease-specific validation. A subgroup of 77 patients was prospectively followed to further dissect the association between alterations in gut microbiota and treatment response after 6 months of immunosuppressive therapy. Fecal microbiota samples were collected from all participants and analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing.

35977496,Systems approach to define humoral correlates of immunity to Shigella.,"Shigella infection is the second leading cause of death due to diarrheal disease in young children worldwide. With the rise of antibiotic resistance, initiatives to design and deploy a safe and effective Shigella vaccine are urgently needed. However, efforts to date have been hindered by the limited understanding of immunological correlates of protection against shigellosis. We applied systems serology to perform a comprehensive analysis of Shigella-specific antibody responses in sera obtained from volunteers before and after experimental infection with S. flexneri 2a in a series of controlled human challenge studies. Polysaccharide-specific antibody responses are infrequent prior to infection and evolve concomitantly with disease severity. In contrast, pre-existing antibody responses to type 3 secretion system proteins, particularly IpaB, consistently associate with clinical protection from disease. Linked to particular Fc-receptor binding patterns, IpaB-specific antibodies leverage neutrophils and monocytes, and complement and strongly associate with protective immunity. IpaB antibody-mediated functions improve with a subsequent rechallenge resulting in complete clinical protection. Collectively, our systems serological analyses indicate protein-specific functional correlates of immunity against Shigella in humans.","['Bernshtein B', 'Ndungo E', 'Cizmeci D', 'Xu P', 'Kováč P', 'Kelly M', 'Islam D', 'Ryan ET', 'Kotloff KL', 'Pasetti MF', 'Alter G']",2022,40,7,Cell Rep,"Bernshtein B, et al.

Being spread by contaminated food and water, this study highlights how wild caught food, in the form of freshwater catfish, can act as vectors for Shigella flexneri in Southern Kenya. A metatranscriptomic approach was used to identify the presence of Shigella flexneri in the catfish which had been caught for consumption from the Galana river. The use of nanopore sequencing was shown to be a simple and effective method to highlight the presence of Shigella flexneri and could represent a potential new tool in the detection and prevention of this deadly pathogen. Rather than the presence/absence results of more traditional testing methods, the use of metatranscriptomics highlighted how primarily one SOS response gene was being transcribed, suggesting the bacteria may be dormant in the catfish. Additionally, COI sequencing of the vector catfish revealed they likely represent a cryptic species. Morphological assignment suggested the fish were widehead catfish Clarotes laticeps, which range across Africa, but the COI sequences from the Kenyan fish are distinctly different from C. laticeps sequenced in West Africa.","['Tighe AJ', 'Grayson S', 'Byrne J', 'Hintikka S', 'Jessen L', 'Dempsey J', 'Browne L', 'Kelly-Quinn M', 'Fulanda B', 'Ruane NM', 'Carlsson J']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Tighe AJ, et al.

35973958,Historical gold mining infectious disease epidemics.,"Lethal infectious disease epidemics have historically occurred in military, refugee and mining camps where crowded conditions promote the spread of enteric, respiratory and insect-borne infections. The early history of gold mines around Palmer River, Queensland in the 1870s, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia in the 1890s and Papua on the island of New Guinea in the 1910s are recounted specifically as it relates to infectious disease deaths. Despite large diagnostic gaps, it is likely that malaria was the predominant problem in Palmer River, typhoid in Kalgoorlie and bacillary dysentery in Papua. Nearly two-thirds of all recorded deaths in the Palmer River district from 1873 to 1883 were due to infections, predominately 'fevers'. Typhoid fever likely killed >2000 Australians in the early phases of the Western Australian goldfields in the 1890s. Severe dysentery outbreaks killed up to a majority of the local workforce in the Lakekema goldfields of Papua resulting in the colonial authorities stopping mining activity in the second decade of the 20th century. In the absence of public health measures and specific chemotherapy, large mortality rates in miners reflected the over-riding economic drivers of gold miners and their lack of any understanding of microbial disease and its interruption by public health measures. Similar infectious disease epidemics are likely to reoccur when large numbers of impoverished miners use low-technology methods to work alluvial gold deposits in conflict areas as has been seen in modern Africa.",['Shanks GD'],2022,52,8,Intern Med J,Shanks GD.

35956001,Pentraxin 3 and Shigella LPS and IpaB Antibodies Interplay to Defeat Shigellosis.,"Shigella causes moderate to severe diarrhea or dysentery after invading the colon mucosa. Long Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is recognized as the humoral component of the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens. We examined the interplay between levels of PTX3 and levels of anti-Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and anti-Shigella type 3 secretion system protein-IpaB antibodies in children during acute shigellosis and after recovery. PTX3 concentrations in serum and stool extracts were determined by sandwich ELISA using commercial anti-PTX3 antibodies. Serum IgG, IgM, and IgA anti-S. sonnei LPS or anti-S. sonnei IpaB were measured using in house ELISA. Children with acute shigellosis (n = 60) had elevated PTX3 levels in serum and stools as compared with recovered subjects (9.6 ng/mL versus 4.7 ng/mL, p < 0.009 in serum and 16.3 ng/g versus 1.1 ng/g in stool, p = 0.011). Very low levels of PTX3 were detected in stools of healthy children (0.3 ng/g). Increased serum levels of PTX3 correlated with high fever accompanied by bloody or numerous diarrheal stools characteristic of more severe shigellosis while short pentraxin; C-Reactive Protein (CRP) did not show such a correlation. PTX3 decreased in convalescence while anti-Shigella antibodies increased, switching the response from innate to adaptive toward the eradication of the invasive organism. These data can inform the development of Shigella vaccines and treatment options.","['Meron-Sudai S', 'Reizis A', 'Goren S', 'Bialik A', 'Hochberg A', 'Cohen D']",2022,11,15,J Clin Med,"Meron-Sudai S, et al.

35952542,Mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics and computational vaccinology strategies for the identification of universal Shigella immunogenic candidates.,"Shigella is a Gram-negative bacteria that cause shigellosis. Treatment with antibiotics cannot be sustained to control the bacterial infection due to the risk of antibiotic resistance. Vaccine development against the highly prevalent Shigella serotypes could provide a generous benefit in reducing the occurrence of shigellosis. The present study is aimed to identify the peptides that could be the ideal candidates for the Shigella vaccine development. THP-1 human macrophage cell lines were infected with clinical strains of Shigella flexneri 2a. The bacterial peptides bound on HLA class II molecules of infected THP-1 were analyzed and identified using the immunopeptidomics approach. Following mass spectrometry identification, a total of 14 proteins were predicted by PSORTb, CELLO, and Gneg-mPLoc as outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Shigella. Of which, 12 OMPs were found to be conserved among Shigella species and had no significance with human proteomes. Outer membrane receptor FepA and TonB-dependent receptor were among the OMPs predicted to possess the high number of immunogenic B- and T-cell epitopes. The epitopes with high antigenicity from FepA and TonB were identified as potential peptide candidates for Shigella vaccine development. The immunoreactivity of the constructed recombinant proteins were determined using the Shigella-infected human and rabbit sera, respectively. Their protective efficacy and immune responses in controlling the Shigella infection will further be investigated in experimental animal models.","['Mohammad Shabani NR', 'Khairul Hisyam Ismail CM', 'Anthony AA', 'Leow CH', 'Chuah C', 'Abdul Majeed AB', 'Nor NM', 'He Y', 'Banga Singh KK', 'Leow CY']",2022,148,,Comput Biol Med,"Mohammad Shabani NR, et al.

35918380,Golgi stress induces SIRT2 to counteract Shigella infection via defatty-acylation.,"Enzymes from pathogens often modulate host protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), facilitating survival and proliferation of pathogens. Shigella virulence factors IpaJ and IcsB induce proteolytic cleavage and lysine fatty acylation on host proteins, which cause Golgi stress and suppress innate immunity, respectively. However, it is unknown whether host enzymes could reverse such modifications introduced by pathogens' virulence factors to suppress pathogenesis. Herein, we report that SIRT2, a potent lysine defatty-acylase, is upregulated by the transcription factor CREB3 under Golgi stress induced by Shigella infection. SIRT2 in turn removes the lysine fatty acylation introduced by Shigella virulence factor IcsB to enhance host innate immunity. SIRT2 knockout mice are more susceptible to Shigella infection than wildtype mice, demonstrating the importance of SIRT2 to counteract Shigella infection.","['Wang M', 'Zhang Y', 'Komaniecki GP', 'Lu X', 'Cao J', 'Zhang M', 'Yu T', 'Hou D', 'Spiegelman NA', 'Yang M', 'Price IR', 'Lin H']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Wang M, et al.

35882342,The impact of heavy precipitation and its impact modifiers on shigellosis occurrence during typhoon season in Taiwan: A case-crossover design.,"Because of climate change, heavy precipitation is likely to become frequent and intense, thereby increasing the risk of shigellosis occurrence. However, few studies examined the impact of heavy precipitation on shigellosis and its impact modifiers in developed countries. This study aims to analyze the association between heavy precipitation and shigellosis in Taiwan, and to identify the vulnerable population and impact modifiers. We adopted a case-crossover design, and used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for shigellosis occurrence. Information were collected on the daily shigellosis cases, precipitation, temperature, and typhoons from 1994 to 2015, and yearly data of medical resources and environmental factors were obtained at the city level from 1998 to 2015. Stratification analyses were performed by age, sex, medical resource, and environmental factors. We discovered that heavy precipitation ≥80 mm/day considerably increased the risk of shigellosis occurrence. The ORs of heavy rain (80 to <200 mm/day) were 2.08-2.26 at lags 0-1. The ORs of extremely heavy rain (≥200 mm/day) increased to 2.17-4.73 at lags 5-8. Moreover, the effect of heavy precipitation was greater under high temperature condition (≥23.6 °C). Adults were more susceptible to heavy-precipitation-associated shigellosis, especially the elderly. Males experienced marginally higher effects than females did. Moreover, cities with more medical resources and forest cover and higher percentage of completed storm sewers had lower effects; however, dense population and higher pig density were the risk factors. Although the high water-supply penetration rate did not decrease Shigella infection after heavy precipitation, it did lower the risk of typhoon-related shigellosis. In conclusion, hot temperature could enhance the impact of heavy precipitation on shigellosis. Public health interventions should be introduced according to the lag period after heavy precipitation, particularly in areas with high population density, proportion of elderly people, and pig density. The improvement of medical resources and tree cover as well as the construction of storm sewers and piped water systems might be mitigation measures that can be considered.","['Chen NT', 'Chen YC', 'Wu CD', 'Chen MJ', 'Guo YL']",2022,848,,Sci Total Environ,"Chen NT, et al.

35871311,Computational characterization of homologous ligands binding to a deep hydrophobic pocket in Shigella flexneri pilot protein MxiM.,"The type III secretion system (T3SS) is an important molecular machinery in gram-negative bacteria Shigella flexneri as it provides ways for translocating virulence factors from the bacteria into host cells, eventually leading to severe disease symptoms such as bacillary dysentery. Due to the rising concerns of antibiotics resistance in bactericidal strategy, the anti-virulence strategy that primarily targets the T3SS components becomes an attractive alternative. MxiM, the secretin pilot protein of Shigella flexneri, binds the secretin MxiD and facilitates the formation of the secretin ring in outer membrane in T3SS assembly. MxiM harbors a large hydrophobic pocket that has been shown to be important in MxiM-MxiD interaction. In this work, I examined the ligand binding property of MxiM by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the association between MxiM and a series of hydrophobic ligands, with simulation time amounted to 30 μs. MD simulations successfully captured spontaneous ligand binding events in 153 of the 300 trajectories. The ligand binding can be categorized into two types: a fast type, in which the ligand binds quickly into the hydrophobic pocket and a slow type, in which the ligand forms an encounter complex with the protein before binding into the hydrophobic pocket. Using the MxiM-ligand binding poses captured in MD simulations, I additionally performed umbrella-sampling MD simulations with total simulation time amounted to 63 μs to obtain protein-ligand binding free energies. The relationship between the ligand binding free energy and ligand size appears to be nonlinear and exhibits an exponential decay pattern. In summary, I performed computational characterization of MxiM-hydrophobic ligand binding capabilities and properties, which may provide valuable insights into designing anti-bacterial medicine against antibiotics resistance in Shigella flexneri.",['Zhu S'],2022,90,12,Proteins,Zhu S.

35861099,Shigellosis in Poland in 2018-2019.,"AIM: The purpose of this study is evaluation of the epidemiological situation of shigellosis in Poland in years 2018-2019, comparing to previous years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation of epidemiological situation of shigellosis in Poland was based on analysis of data from epidemiological surveillance collected in questionnaires and sent to the Department of Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases and Surveillance NIPH NIH-NRI by sanitary stations. Once a case was reported on a ZLK-1 and/or ZLB-1 form to the appropriate State Sanitary Inspector, an epidemiological investigation was conducted by collecting additional information from medical records and from the patient interview. Data from the ""Infectious Diseases and Poisonings"" bulletins years 2012-2019 was also used as well as data from shigellosis outbreaks acquired through ROE system - registry created for outbreak data gathering.
RESULTS: In Poland in years 2018-2019 a total of 321 cases of shigellosis was reported. Incidence per 100,000 was 0.74 in 2018, which was considerably more than in previous years, and in 2019 was 0.10 - similarly as two years before. The most cases belonged to the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups, and the least cases to the 0-4 age group. Majority of them were women. Percentage of hospitalizations was 27% in described period. Regarding to previous years, in 2018 decrease of hospitalizations was noted. Imported cases were 54.8% of all with predominance of imports from Albania. Twenty eight percent of infections were caused by S. sonnei species. In discussed years 10 outbreaks were registered with 246 people ill, including two large outbreaks (77 and 150 cases). August was the month with the highest number of cases (217 cases, 67.6% of all), 62.2% of them were imported.
CONCLUSIONS: Increase in number of cases and incidence of shigellosis in Poland in 2018 was caused by occurrence of two large epidemic outbreaks. Because of high percentage of imported cases, traveling to shigellosis endemic countries is currently the main risk factor for contracting the disease. This indicates the need for education for those who travel to endemic areas.","['Nowacka Z', 'Księżak E', 'Polański P', 'Sadkowska-Todys M']",2022,76,1,Przegl Epidemiol,"Nowacka Z, et al.

Antimicrobial resistance has been known to worsen the existing challenge in the management of Salmonella and Shigella infections. The aim is to isolate and identify Salmonella and Shigella among children less than five years with diarrhea and to determine resistance to commonly prescribed drugs at the Lodwar County and Referral Hospital in Northern Kenya.
METHODS: using a cross-sectional study design, a descriptive experimental study was conducted on 196 children with diarrhea using rectal swabs. A structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic information. Samples were then received in the microbiology laboratory, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations were done before culture on specific selective media. Thereafter, biochemical confirmation of the growths done then confirmed results tabulated before analysis.
RESULTS: from the total samples collected (196) Shigella dysenteriae cases were 4 (5%), while Shigella Flexneri were 7 (9%), Shigella sonnei were 3 (4%), Shigella boydii were 4 (5%) and Salmonella typhimurium were 2 (2.4%). From these, about 70% of the isolated Salmonella and Shigella demonstrated high antibiotic resistance to Amoxilliclav and Ampicillin, both with high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) values of about 8ug/ml. While over 80% drug susceptibility was noted in Amikacin (1ug/ml), Ciprofloxacin (2ug/ml), Ceftriaxone (4ug/ml) and Ceftazidime (4ug/ml).
CONCLUSION: Salmonella and Shigella are among the common contributors of diarrhea among children less than five years. Drug resistance among the commonly used antibiotics is a serious indicator that possible misuse of antibiotics especially the beta lactam penicillin's.","['Leting SK', 'Musyoki SK', 'Maiyoh GK']",2022,42,,Pan Afr Med J,"Leting SK, et al.

35809593,"Outbreak of sexually transmitted, extensively drug-resistant Shigella sonnei in the UK, 2021-22: a descriptive epidemiological study.","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis, traditionally a foodborne and waterborne infection, causes substantial morbidity globally. It is now a leading cause of sexually transmitted gastroenteritis among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). We describe an ongoing outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Shigella sonnei in the UK.
METHODS: Routine laboratory surveillance (Second Generation Surveillance System, Gastrointestinal Data Warehouse) identified an exceedance of S sonnei clade 5 in England, first detected in September, 2021. Cases within this clade were subsequently reported from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Confirmed cases in this outbreak were defined as individuals diagnosed with S sonnei clade 5 in the UK, with a specimen date between Sept 1, 2021, and Feb 9, 2022, who were genomically confirmed as part of a ten-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage cluster. We used whole-genome sequencing with SNP typing to identify genomic clusters and antimicrobial-resistance determinants, analysing cases across the UK. We collected demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data from people infected with S sonnei clade 5 in England using questionnaires (standard and bespoke outbreak questionnaires). We used descriptive summary statistics to characterise cases.
FINDINGS: 72 cases (70 [97%] male, median age 34 years [IQR 27-39]) belonging to the ten-SNP single linkage cluster of S sonnei clade 5 were identified between Sept 4, 2021, and Feb 9, 2022. Isolates were predominantly XDR, with 66 (92%) of 72 harbouring bla
INTERPRETATION: We highlight the rapid dissemination of XDR ESBL-producing S sonnei in sexual networks of MSM. We recommend strengthening shigella testing where clinically indicated, antimicrobial-resistance surveillance, and integrated health promotion messaging among all MSM, including PrEP users, to reduce the burden of shigellosis.

35804311,Genomic and proteomic characterization of two strains of Shigella flexneri 2 isolated from infants' stool samples in Argentina.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella specie is a globally important intestinal pathogen disseminated all over the world. In this study we analyzed the genome and the proteomic component of two Shigella flexneri 2a clinical isolates, collected from pediatric patients with gastroenteritis of the Northwest region of Argentina (NWA) in two periods of time, with four years of difference. Our goal was to determine putative changes at molecular levels occurred during these four years, that could explain the presence of this Shigella`s serovar as the prevalent pathogen in the population under study.
RESULTS: As previously reported, our findings support the idea of Shigella has a conserved ""core"" genome, since comparative studies of CI133 and CI172 genomes performed against 80 genomes obtained from the NCBI database, showed that there is a large number of genes shared among all of them. However, we observed that CI133 and CI172 harbors a small number of strain-specific genes, several of them present in mobile genetic elements, supporting the hypothesis that these isolates were established in the population by horizontal acquisition of genes. These differences were also observed at proteomic level, where it was possible to detect the presence of certain secreted proteins in a culture medium that simulates the host environment.
CONCLUSION: Great similarities were observed between the CI133 and CI172 strains, confirming the high percentage of genes constituting the ""core"" genome of S. flexneri 2. However, numerous strain specific genes were also determined. The presence of the here identified molecular elements into other strain of our culture collation, is currently used to develop characteristic markers of local pathogens. In addition, the most outstanding result of this study was the first description of a S. flexneri 2 producing Colicin E, as one of the characteristics that allows S. flexneri 2 to persist in the microbial community. These findings could also contribute to clarify the mechanism and the evolution strategy used by this pathogen to specifically colonize, survive, and cause infection within the NWA population.","['Torrez Lamberti MF', 'Terán LC', 'Lopez FE', 'de Las Mercedes Pescaretti M', 'Delgado MA']",2022,23,1,BMC Genomics,"Torrez Lamberti MF, et al.

35759194,Time-Resolved Fluorescence Microscopy Screens on Host Protein Subversion During Bacterial Cell Invasion.,"Intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved a plethora of strategies to invade eukaryotic cells. By manipulating host signaling pathways, in particular vesicular trafficking, these microbes subvert host functions to promote their internalization and to establish an intracellular niche. During these events, host endomembrane compartments are dynamically reorganized. Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, recruits components of the host recycling pathway and the exocyst of non-phagocytic enterocytes in the vicinity of its entry site to facilitate its access to the host cytosol. These factors are either dynamically tethered to in situ formed macropinosomes or to the bacteria-containing vacuole itself. The underlying interactions cannot readily be monitored as individual bacterial infection events take place without synchronicity using cellular infection models. Therefore, time-resolved screens by fluorescence microscopy represent a powerful tool for the study of host subversion. Such screens can be performed with libraries of fluorescently tagged host factors. Using the cytosolic pathogenic agent Shigella flexneri as a model, we provide detailed protocols for such medium-to-high throughput multidimensional imaging screening of the dynamic host-pathogen cross talk. Our workflow is designed to be easily adapted for the study of different host factor libraries and different pathogen models.","['Sanchez L', 'Chang YY', 'Mellouk N', 'Enninga J']",2022,2523,,Methods Mol Biol,"Sanchez L, et al.

35582740,Localization of host endocytic and actin-associated proteins during Shigella flexneri intracellular motility and intercellular spreading.,"Shigella flexneri (S. flexneri), the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, uses an effector-mediated strategy to hijack host cells and cause disease. To propagate and spread within human tissues, S. flexneri bacteria commandeer the host actin cytoskeleton to generate slender actin-rich comet tails to move intracellularly, and later, plasma membrane actin-based protrusions to move directly between adjacent host cells. To facilitate intercellular bacterial spreading, large micron-sized endocytic-like membrane invaginations form at the periphery of neighboring host cells that come into contact with S. flexneri-containing membrane protrusions. While S. flexneri comet tails and membrane protrusions consist primarily of host actin cytoskeletal proteins, S. flexneri membrane invaginations remain poorly understood with only clathrin and the clathrin adapter epsin-1 localized to the structures. Tangentially, we recently reported that Listeria monocytogenes, another actin-hijacking pathogen, exploits an assortment of caveolar and actin-bundling proteins at their micron-sized membrane invaginations formed during their cell-to-cell movement. Thus, to further characterize the S. flexneri disease process, we set out to catalog the distribution of a variety of actin-associated and caveolar proteins during S. flexneri actin-based motility and cell-to-cell spreading. Here we show that actin-associated proteins found at L. monocytogenes comet tails and membrane protrusions mimic those present at S. flexneri comet tails with the exception of α-actinins 1 and 4, which were shed from S. flexneri membrane protrusions. We also demonstrate that all known host endocytic components found at L. monocytogenes membrane invaginations are also present at those formed during S. flexneri infections.","['Dhanda AS', 'Guttman JA']",2023,306,5,Anat Rec (Hoboken),Dhanda AS and Guttman JA.

35546037,High frequency of antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene in Shigella species isolated from pediatric patients in an Iranian Referral Hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella is a main cause of gastroenteritis and it is responsible for 5 to 10 % of diarrhea through the world. The aims of this study were to assess the antibiotic susceptibility pattern and the presence of 3 common virulence genes (sigA, virF, invE) of Shigella strains isolated from patients with gastroenteritis in Children's Medical Center Hospital, Tehran, Iran.
METHODS: Over a period of 15 months, all Shigella species collected from the patients with gastroenteritis were entered to the study. Susceptibility testing of all isolates towards different antibiotics was performed using the disk diffusion method and the prevalence of virulence genes was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology.
RESULTS: Among a total of 183 Shigella strains, 128 Shigella sonnei (70%) and 55 S. flexneri (30%) were isolated. The resistance rate to the antibiotics in S. sonnei strains was higher than S. flexneri. The most sensitive antibiotics for S. flexneri strains were gentamicin (98%), amikacin (85%) and ciprofloxacin (82%), while high resistance rate to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96%), ampicillin (96%), nalidixic acid (64%) and cefotaxime (60%) was observed. The frequency of invE, virF and sigA gene in S. flexneri strains was 89 %, 93 % and 56 %, respectively; whereas they found in 93 %, 96 %, and 100 % of S. sonnei strains, respectively. SigA gene was identified significantly higher in the S. sonnei strains (100%). There was no significant difference between the presence of virF and invE genes among Shigella strains.
CONCLUSION: The high presence of sigA gene in S. sonnei strains plays an important role in its pathogenesis, and the high frequency of invE and virF genes showed that this classical pathway regulating the expression of Shigella virulence factor genes could play a key role in the pathogenesis of this bacterium.","['Mamishi S', 'Pourakbari B', 'Ghaffari Charati M', 'Mahmoudi S', 'Abdolsalehi MR', 'Hosseinpour Sadeghi R']",2022,93,2,Acta Biomed,"Mamishi S, et al.

35533017,"Shigellosis Cases With Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infections: Population-Based Data From 6 US Jurisdictions, 2007 to 2016.","BACKGROUND: Shigella species, which cause acute diarrheal disease, are transmitted via fecal-oral and sexual contact. To better understand the overlapping populations affected by Shigella infections and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States, we examined the occurrence of reported STIs within 24 months among shigellosis case-patients.
METHODS: Culture-confirmed Shigella cases diagnosed from 2007 to 2016 among residents of 6 US jurisdictions were matched to reports of STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, and all stages of syphilis) diagnosed 12 months before or after the shigellosis case. We examined epidemiologic characteristics and reported temporal trends of Shigella cases by sex and species.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, 10,430 shigellosis cases were reported. The annual number of reported shigellosis cases across jurisdictions increased 70%, from 821 cases in 2007 to 1398 cases in 2016; males saw a larger increase compared with females. Twenty percent of male shigellosis case-patients had an STI reported in the reference period versus 4% of female case-patients. The percentage of male shigellosis case-patients with an STI increased from 11% (2007) to 28% (2016); the overall percentage among females remained low.
CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the substantial proportion of males with shigellosis who were diagnosed with STIs within 24 months and the benefit of matching data across programs.

35422342,Differential dendritic immune cell responses to infection with various serotypes of Shigella.,"PURPOSE: Dendritic cells (DC) are key regulators of immune response with the ability to affect both the innate and adaptive immune responses and are abundant in the gut mucosa. The severity of shigellosis varies with the serotype involved with S. dysenteriae producing the severest infections with complications and S. sonnei being at the other end of spectrum usually causing mild self-limiting diarrhea. While Shigella are known to induce the apoptosis of mature DCs, there is no information on cytokine milieu of DCs incubated with different serotypes of Shigella.
METHODS: Monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) were developed from healthy human PBMC after 8 days of culture. DCs were infected with different Shigella serotypes. After 24 ​h post infection, relative expression of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-12p70, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 was studied by Real Time PCR and cytometric bead arrays (CBA).
RESULTS: We found that different serotypes of Shigella significantly stimulated production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-23, INF-γ and TNF-α compared to uninfected DCs and there were significant differences among these serotypes. At transcriptional level, highest levels of expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 were observed in S. dysenteriae infected DCs. Significant serotypic differences were noted between S. dysenteriae & S. flexneri and between S. dysenteriae &S. sonnei.
CONCLUSIONS: DCs are critical sentinel cells that relay microbial presence either directly or indirectly to naive T cells. In this study we found that S. dysenteriae caused maximum expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, S. dysenteriae also caused highest expression of IL-17A and IL-22A. It was the only serotype, which increased IL-23. These findings could explain more severity of SD as compared to SF and SS.","['Narayan C', 'Kant V', 'Mahajan JK', 'Mohan B', 'Taneja N']",2022,40,2,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Narayan C, et al.

35390371,Effect and attributable burden of hot extremes on bacillary dysentery in 31 Chinese provincial capital cities.,"BACKGROUND: High atmospheric temperature has been associated with the occurrence of bacillary dysentery (BD). Recent studies have suggested that hot extremes may influence health outcomes, however, none have examined the association between hot extremes and BD risk, especially at the national level.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect and attributable burden of hot extremes on BD cases and to identify populations at high risk of BD.
METHODS: Daily incident BD data of 31 provincial capital cities from 2010 to 2018 were collected from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, weather data was obtained from the fifth generation of the European Re-Analysis Dataset. Three types of hot extremes, including hot day, hot night, and hot day and night, were defined according to single or sequential occurrence of daytime hot and nighttime hot within 24 h. A two-stage analytical strategy combined with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) was used to evaluate city-specific associations and national pooled estimates.
RESULTS: Hot extremes were significantly associated with the risk of BD on lagged 1-6 days. The overall cumulative relative risk (RR) was 1.136 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.022, 1.263] for hot day, 1.181 (95% CI: 1.019, 1.369) for hot night, and 1.154 (95% CI: 1.038, 1.283) for hot day and night. Northern residents, females, and children younger than or equal to 14 years old were vulnerable under hot night, southern residents were vulnerable under hot day, and males were vulnerable under hot day and night. 1.854% (95% CI: 1.294%, 2.205%) of BD cases can be attributable to hot extremes, among which, hot night accounted for a large proportion.
CONCLUSIONS: Hot extremes may significantly increase the incidence risk and disease burden of BD. Type-specific protective measures should be taken to reduce the risk of BD, especially in those we found to be particularly vulnerable.","['Ai S', 'Zhou H', 'Wang C', 'Qian ZM', 'McMillin SE', 'Huang C', 'Zhang T', 'Xu L', 'Li Z', 'Lin H']",2022,832,,Sci Total Environ,"Ai S, et al.

The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of temperature and other meteorological variables on BD in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, which is a high-risk area for BD distribution.
METHODS: Our study was based on the daily-scale data of BD cases and meteorological variables from 2014 to 2019, using generalized additive model (GAM) to explore the relationship between meteorological variables and BD cases and distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to analyze the lag and cumulative effects. The interaction effects and stratified analysis were developed by the GAM.
RESULTS: A total of 147,001 cases were reported from 2014 to 2019. The relationship between temperature and BD was approximately liner above 0 °C, but the turning point of total temperature effect was 10 °C. Results of DLNM indicated that the effect of high temperature was significant on lag 5d and lag 6d, and the lag effect showed that each 5 °C rise caused a 3% [Relative risk (RR) = 1.03, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.05] increase in BD cases. The cumulative BD cases delayed by 7 days increased by 31% for each 5 °C rise in temperature above 10 °C (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.30-1.33). The interaction effects and stratified analysis manifested that the incidence of BD was highest in hot and humid climates.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that temperature can significantly affect the incidence of BD, and its effect can be enhanced by humidity and precipitation, which means that the hot and humid environment positively increases the incidence of BD.","['Chang Q', 'Wang K', 'Zhang H', 'Li C', 'Wang Y', 'Jing H', 'Li S', 'Guo Y', 'Cui Z', 'Zhang W']",2022,27,,Environ Health Prev Med,"Chang Q, et al.

It causes bloody diarrhea, and around 99% of bacillary dysentery cases occur in developing countries. The objective of this study is to develop a polyherbal formulation with the scientific rationale in treating infectious bacillary dysentery disease. The anti-bacterial activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the formulation against bacillary dysentery, causing microbes like Shigella flexneri (MTCC 1457), Escherichia coli (MTCC 1687), and Salmonella enterica (MTCC 98), was analysed by well-diffusion method and broth dilution method, respectively. The biofilm inhibition activity was determined on 96 well polystyrene plates and anti-quorum sensing activity by Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. The cytotoxicity was examined by acute oral toxicity. Excreta and organ bacterial load were analyzed by serial dilution method. The formulation efficacy was determined by analyzing the blood sample of rats. The antimicrobial efficacy of the developed formulation was calculated by measuring the zone of inhibition which was found to be 24 mm, 25 mm, and 25 mm, and the MIC values of 1.5 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ml, and 2.0 mg/ml against S. flexneri, S. enterica, E. coli, respectively. The results show that the polyherbal formulation significantly reduced biofilm formation and has anti-quorum sensing activity. The formulation also effectively decreases the bacterial load and increases the K+, Na+, and Ca++ ions in animals treated with the formulation. The developed formulation was found to be non-toxic and effective against bacillary dysentery; thus, it can be used for treating bacillary dysentery and related complications.","['Singh D', 'Singh V', 'Bhushan Mishra S', 'Sharma D', 'Agarwal V']",2022,20,1,J Appl Biomed,"Singh D, et al.

35294289,Mechanistic insights into the subversion of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex by the E3 ligase IpaH1.4 of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri, a gram-negative bacterium, is the major culprit of bacterial shigellosis and causes a large number of human infection cases and deaths worldwide annually. For evading the host immune response during infection, S. flexneri secrets two highly similar E3 ligases, IpaH1.4 and IpaH2.5, to subvert the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) of host cells, which is composed of HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underpinning the subversion of the LUBAC by IpaH1.4/2.5 remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that IpaH1.4 can specifically recognize HOIP and HOIL-1L through its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain by binding to the HOIP RING1 domain and HOIL-1L ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, respectively. The determined crystal structures of IpaH1.4 LRR/HOIP RING1, IpaH1.4 LRR/HOIL-1L UBL, and HOIP RING1/UBE2L3 complexes not only elucidate the binding mechanisms of IpaH1.4 with HOIP and HOIL-1L but also unveil that the recognition of HOIP by IpaH1.4 can inhibit the E2 binding of HOIP. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the interaction of IpaH1.4 LRR with HOIP RING1 or HOIL-1L UBL is essential for the ubiquitination of HOIP or HOIL-1L in vitro as well as the suppression of NF-κB activation by IpaH1.4 in cells. In summary, our work elucidated that in addition to inducing the proteasomal degradation of LUBAC, IpaH1.4 can also inhibit the E3 activity of LUBAC by blocking its E2 loading and/or disturbing its stability, thereby providing a paradigm showing how a bacterial E3 ligase adopts multiple tactics to subvert the key LUBAC of host cells.","['Liu J', 'Wang Y', 'Wang D', 'Wang Y', 'Xu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Y', 'Zhang M', 'Gong X', 'Tang Y', 'Shen L', 'Li M', 'Pan L']",2022,119,12,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Liu J, et al.

35278387,Associations between ambient temperature and enteric infections by pathogen: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have quantified the associations between ambient temperature and enteric infections, particularly all-cause enteric infections. However, the temperature sensitivity of enteric infections might be pathogen dependent. Here, we sought to identify pathogen-specific associations between ambient temperature and enteric infections.
METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for peer-reviewed research articles published from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2019, and also hand searched reference lists of included articles and excluded reviews. We included studies that quantified the effects of ambient temperature increases on common pathogen-specific enteric infections in humans. We excluded studies that expressed ambient temperature as a categorical or diurnal range, or in a standardised format. Two authors screened the search results, one author extracted data from eligible studies, and four authors verified the data. We obtained the overall risks by pooling the relative risks of enteric infection by pathogen for each 1°C temperature rise using random-effects modelling and robust variance estimation for the correlated effect estimates. Between-study heterogeneity was measured using I
FINDINGS: We identified 2981 articles via database searches and 57 articles from scanning reference lists of excluded reviews and included articles, of which 40 were eligible for pathogen-specific meta-analyses. The overall increased risks of incidence per 1°C temperature rise, expressed as relative risks, were 1·05 (95% CI 1·04-1·07; I
INTERPRETATION: Temperature sensitivity of enteric infections can vary according to the enteropathogen causing the infection, particularly for bacteria. Thus, we encourage a pathogen-specific health adaptation approach, such as vaccination, given the possibility of increasingly warm temperatures in the future.

Limited studies have been conducted on molecular pattern of antibiotic resistance of S. flexneri in diarrhea endemic areas of Pakistan. The aim of the study was to analyze the antimicrobial resistance of S. flexneri isolated from pediatric diarrheal patients in Peshawar, Pakistan. A total of 199 S. flexneri isolates (clinical, n = 1 55 and non-clinical, n = 44) were investigated for drug resistance and mutational analysis of selected drug resistance genes. All isolates were found to be highly resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (88%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (77%), chloramphenicol (43%), and quinolones (41.6%). About 34.5% S. flexneri isolates were found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporin. None of the isolates was resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and amikacin. Interestingly high frequency of third-generation cephalosporin resistance was observed in S. flexneri isolated from non-clinical samples (49%) when compared to clinical samples (30.5%). Furthermore, the most prevalent phenotypic-resistant patterns among third-generation cephalosporin-resistant isolates were AMC,CAZ,CPD,CFM,CRO,SXT (13%) followed by OFX,AMC,CAZ,CPD,CFM,CRO,SXT,NA,CIP (10%). The most frequently detected resistance genes were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (sul2 = 84%), beta-lactamase genes (blaOXA = 87%), quinolones (qnrS = 77%), and chloramphenicol (cat = 64%). No mutation was detected in any drug-resistant genes. We are reporting for the first time the sequence of the blaTEM gene in S. flexneri. Furthermore, high third-generation cephalosporin resistance was observed in the patients who practiced self-medication as compared to those who took medication according to physician prescription. This study shows the high emergence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant S. flexneri isolates, which is a potential threat to the community in the country. This finding will be helpful to develop a suitable antibiotic prescription regime to treat shigellosis.","['Nisa I', 'Haroon M', 'Driessen A', 'Nijland J', 'Rahman H', 'Yasin N', 'Hussain M', 'Khan TA', 'Ali A', 'Khan SA', 'Qasim M']",2022,79,4,Curr Microbiol,"Nisa I, et al.

35218200,Bacteriophage Sf6 host range mutant that infects Shigella flexneri serotype 2a2 strains.,"Shigella flexneri serotype 2a2 (II:9;10) is the most prevalent strain in causing bacillary dysentery in developing countries. Chemical modifications such as glucosylation, O-acetylation, and phosphoethanolamine modifications of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen (Oag) contribute to the emergence of various serotypes. Sf6 is a Shigella-specific bacteriophage that infects only a limited range of S. flexneri serotypes [X, Y]. LPS Oag is the primary receptor for bacteriophage Sf6 where it uses its tailspike protein (TSP) in binding and hydrolysing LPS Oags. Sf6TSP has recently been shown to be capable of hydrolysing the LPS Oag of Type II strains, albeit modestly. Phage therapy has regained attention in recent years as an alternative therapeutic approach. Therefore, this study aimed to expand the host range of Sf6 to the prevalent S. flexneri serotype 2a2 strain. We discovered a new lytic Sf6 host range mutant that is capable of infecting S. flexneri serotype 2a2 and identified residues in Sf6TSP that may potentially be involved in binding and hydrolysing serotype 2a2 LPS Oag. This work increased the limited Shigella-specific bacteriophage collection and may be useful in the future for phage therapy and/or biocontrolling of S. flexneri in contaminated food and water.","['Teh MY', 'Tran ENH', 'Morona R']",2022,369,1,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Teh MY, et al.

35193669,Virulence genes expression profiling of different Shigella flexneri serotypes in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is a self-limiting disease that antibiotic therapy could decrease its complications and duration. However, sublethal levels of antibiotics, may lead to alteration in disease state, besides its role in the emergence of resistant variants. To understand this link, we investigated diversity of Shigella serogroups in children with diarrhea, diversity of S. flexneri serotypes, cytotoxic potential, resistance patterns to antibiotics, and alteration in transcriptional expression of main virulence genes in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin.
RESULTS: The most frequently isolated serogroups were S. sonnei (70.3%), followed by S. flexneri (29.1%) and S. boydii (0.6%). Ten serotypes were characterized among the S. flexneri isolates, including 2b, 1b, 2a, 1c, 4a, 3a, 3b, 6 and X and/or Xv. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed low frequency of multi-drug resistance phenotype among S. flexneri isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.5-64 and 0.25-8 µg/mL for azithromycin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of icsA in serotype 4a after exposure with azithromycin, whereas other genes in the VirF pathway were downregulated, and downregulation of virB in serotypes 2a and 3a after exposure with ciprofloxacin, while upregulation of noted genes was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Alteration in transcription of key virulence genes of S. flexneri serotypes was shown in response to sublethal concentration of antibiotics. The detected incongruency in the extent of gene transcription proposed that diverse regulatory pathways are possibly mediating response to sub-MIC concentrations of antibiotics in S. flexneri.","['Sadredinamin M', 'Shabani M', 'Karimi A', 'Sohrabi MR', 'Karimi-Yazdi M', 'Ghalavand Z', 'Alebouyeh M']",2022,14,1,Gut Pathog,"Sadredinamin M, et al.

There is an apparent need to develop rapid, cost-effective, sensitive and specific methods for differentiation of Shigella species to be used in outbreaks and health surveillance systems. We developed a sensitive and specific Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) based method followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) assays to differentiate four species of Shigella isolates from stool samples. The FTIR based method was evaluated by differentiation of 91 Shigella species from each other in clinical samples using both gold standards (culture-based and agglutination methods) and developed FTIR assay; eventually, the sensitivity and specificity of the developed method were calculated.

35130324,The type 3 secretion effector IpgD promotes S. flexneri dissemination.,"The bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri causes 270 million cases of bacillary dysentery worldwide every year, resulting in more than 200,000 deaths. S. flexneri pathogenic properties rely on its ability to invade epithelial cells and spread from cell to cell within the colonic epithelium. This dissemination process relies on actin-based motility in the cytosol of infected cells and formation of membrane protrusions that project into adjacent cells and resolve into double-membrane vacuoles (DMVs) from which the pathogen escapes, thereby achieving cell-to-cell spread. S. flexneri dissemination is facilitated by the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that the T3SS effector IpgD facilitates the resolution of membrane protrusions into DMVs during S. flexneri dissemination. The phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatase activity of IpgD decreases PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in membrane protrusions, thereby counteracting de novo cortical actin formation in protrusions, a process that restricts the resolution of protrusions into DMVs. Finally, using an infant rabbit model of shigellosis, we show that IpgD is required for efficient cell-to-cell spread in vivo and contributes to the severity of dysentery.","['Köseoğlu VK', 'Jones MK', 'Agaisse H']",2022,18,2,PLoS Pathog,"Köseoğlu VK, et al.

35118580,"GMMA Technology for the Development of Safe Vaccines: Meta-Analysis of Individual Patient Data to Assess the Safety Profile of Shigella sonnei 1790GAHB Vaccine in Healthy Adults, with Special Focus on Neutropenia.","INTRODUCTION: Shigellosis is a major health concern among children < 5 years of age from developing countries, and there are no widely available vaccines to prevent it. The GMMA-based 1790GAHB investigational vaccine against Shigella sonnei was well tolerated and immunogenic in phase 1 and 2 studies conducted in healthy adults from Shigella endemic and non-endemic populations. Based on pooled data of five individual trials, we assessed the association between vaccine administration and the risk of neutropenia as well as the overall safety profile of 1790GAHB.
METHODS: The risk ratio (RR) of neutropenia was evaluated between participants receiving 1790GAHB (vaccinees) and active comparator/placebo (controls) using different ethnicity-specific absolute neutrophil count (ANC) thresholds established to define neutropenia. Safety was assessed in terms of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: Of the 279 participants, 11 (5.5%) vaccinees and 4 (5.0%) controls had ANC below the appropriate threshold within 7 days post-vaccination. RR was 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.70]. When neutrophil counts of participants of African descent were measured against an ethnicity non-specific threshold, they resulted in neutropenia episodes in 30 (37.0%) vaccinees and 16 (30.2%) controls, while only 2 (2.5%) vaccinees and 1 (1.9%) control had neutropenia when the ethnicity-specific threshold was applied. RRs were 0.98 (95% CI 0.75-1.28) and 1.30 (95% CI 0.1-17.6), respectively. Solicited and unsolicited AEs were slightly more frequent among vaccinees than controls. No serious AEs, other than neutropenia cases, were recorded in the vaccine group.
CONCLUSION: By applying the appropriate threshold, no increased risk of neutropenia was identified in vaccinees compared with the controls. The frequency of neutropenia events varied drastically when ethnicity-appropriate thresholds were applied. This observation highlights the importance of selecting appropriate cut-off values according to the correct population reference. Overall, the 1790GAHB vaccine demonstrated an acceptable safety profile.","['De Ryck I', 'Sarakinou E', 'Nakakana U', 'Cilio GL', 'Ndiaye A', 'Vella V', 'Auerbach J', 'Granada JP', 'Conti V', 'Podda A']",2022,11,2,Infect Dis Ther,"De Ryck I, et al.

35104682,An in silico hierarchal approach for drug candidate mining and validation of natural product inhibitors against pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme in the antibiotic-resistant Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri is the main causative agent of the communicable diarrheal disease, shigellosis. It is estimated that about 80-165 million cases and > 1 million deaths occur every year due to this disease. S. flexneri causes dysentery mostly in young children, elderly and immunocompromised patients, all over the globe. Recently, due to the emergence of S. flexneri antibiotic resistance strains, it is a dire need to predict novel therapeutic drug targets in the bacterium and screen natural products against it, which could eliminate the curse of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, in current study, available antibiotic-resistant genomes (n = 179) of S. flexneri were downloaded from PATRIC database and a pan-genome and resistome analysis was conducted. Around 5059 genes made up the accessory, 2469 genes made up the core, and 1558 genes made up the unique genome fraction, with 44, 34, and 13 antibiotic-resistant genes in each fraction, respectively. Core genome fraction (27% of the pan-genome), which was common to all strains, was used for subtractive genomics and resulted in 384 non-homologous, and 85 druggable targets. Dihydroorotase was chosen for further analysis and docked with natural product libraries (Ayurvedic and Streptomycin compounds), while the control was orotic acid or vitamin B13 (which is a natural binder of this protein). Dynamics simulation of 50 ns was carried out to validate findings for top-scored inhibitors. The current study proposed dihydroorotase as a significant drug target in S. flexneri and 4-tritriacontanone & patupilone compounds as potent drugs against shigellosis. Further experiments are required to ascertain validity of our findings.","['Basharat Z', 'Khan K', 'Jalal K', 'Ahmad D', 'Hayat A', 'Alotaibi G', 'Al Mouslem A', 'Aba Alkhayl FF', 'Almatroudi A']",2022,98,,Infect Genet Evol,"Basharat Z, et al.

The diagnostic assays currently used to detect these pathogens are elaborate or complicated, which make them difficult to apply in resource poor settings where these diseases are endemic. The culture methods used to detect Shigella are not sensitive, and the methods used to detect ETEC are only available in a few research labs. To address this gap, we developed a rapid and simple diagnostic assay-""Rapid LAMP based Diagnostic Test (RLDT)."" The six minutes sample preparation method directly from the fecal samples with lyophilized reaction strips and using established Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) platform, ETEC [heat labile toxin (LT) and heat stable toxins (STh, and STp) genes] and Shigella (ipaH gene) detection was made simple, rapid (<50 minutes), and inexpensive. This assay is cold chain and electricity free. Moreover, RLDT requires minimal equipment. To avoid any end user's bias, a battery-operated, handheld reader was used to read the RLDT results. The results can be read as positive/negative or as real time amplification depending on the end user's need. The performance specifications of the RLDT assay, including analytical sensitivity and specificity, were evaluated using fecal samples spiked with ETEC and Shigella strains. The limit of detection was ~105 CFU/gm of stool for LT, STh, and STp and ~104 CFU/gm of stool for the ipaH gene, which corresponds to about 23 CFU and 1 CFU respectively for ETEC and Shigella per 25uL reaction within 40 minutes. The RLDT assay from stool collection to result is simple, and rapid and at the same time sufficiently sensitive.

Real-time genomic surveillance of Shigella infections has been implemented in several countries, but without the use of a standardised typing scheme. Here, we study over 4000 reference strains and clinical isolates of Shigella, covering all serotypes, with both the current serotyping scheme and the standardised EnteroBase core-genome multilocus sequence typing scheme (cgMLST). The Shigella genomes are grouped into eight phylogenetically distinct clusters, within the E. coli species. The cgMLST hierarchical clustering (HC) analysis at different levels of resolution (HC2000 to HC400) recognises the natural population structure of Shigella. By contrast, the serotyping scheme is affected by horizontal gene transfer, leading to a conflation of genetically unrelated Shigella strains and a separation of genetically related strains. The use of this cgMLST scheme will facilitate the transition from traditional phenotypic typing to routine whole-genome sequencing for the laboratory surveillance of Shigella infections.","['Yassine I', 'Lefèvre S', 'Hansen EE', 'Ruckly C', 'Carle I', 'Lejay-Collin M', 'Fabre L', 'Rafei R', 'Clermont D', 'de la Gandara MP', 'Dabboussi F', 'Thomson NR', 'Weill FX']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Yassine I, et al.

More recently, the World Health Organization advised safe vaccine designing against shigellosis due to the emergence of Shigella dysenteriae resistant strains. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify novel drug targets as well as the design of the potential vaccine candidates and chimeric vaccine models against Shigella dysenteriae. A computational based Reverse Vaccinology along with subtractive genomics analysis is one of the robust approaches used for the prioritization of drug targets and vaccine candidates through direct screening of genome sequence assemblies. Herein, a successfully designed peptide-based novel highly antigenic chimeric vaccine candidate against Shigella dysenteriae sd197 strain is proposed. The study resulted in six epitopes from outer membrane WP_000188255.1 (Fe (3+) dicitrate transport protein FecA) that ultimately leads to the construction of twelve vaccine models. Moreover, V9 construct was found to be highly immunogenic, non-toxic, non-allergenic, highly antigenic, and most stable in terms of molecular docking and simulation studies against six HLAs and TLRS/MD complex. So far, this protein and multiepitope have never been characterized as vaccine targets against Shigella dysenteriae. The current study proposed that V9 could be a significant vaccine candidate against shigellosis and to ascertain that further experiments may be applied by the scientific community focused on shigellosis.","['Jalal K', 'Abu-Izneid T', 'Khan K', 'Abbas M', 'Hayat A', 'Bawazeer S', 'Uddin R']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Jalal K, et al.

34990526,Trends in gastrointestinal infections before and during non-pharmaceutical interventions in Korea in comparison with the United States.,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined how trends in the weekly frequencies of gastrointestinal infectious diseases changed before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Korea, and compared them with the trends in the United States.
METHODS: We compared the weekly frequencies of gastrointestinal infectious diseases (16 bacterial and 6 viral diseases) in Korea during weeks 5-52 before and after COVID-19. In addition, the weekly frequencies of 5 gastrointestinal infectious diseases in the United States (data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) that overlapped with those in Korea were compared.
RESULTS: The mean weekly number of total cases of gastrointestinal infectious diseases in Korea showed a significant decrease (from 522 before COVID-19 to 245 after COVID-19, p<0.01). Only bacterial gastrointestinal infectious diseases caused by Campylobacter increased significantly; other bacterial gastrointestinal infectious diseases showed either a decrease or no change. The incidence of all other viral diseases decreased. In the United States, the weekly numbers of Salmonella, Campylobacter, typhoid, shigellosis, and hepatitis A virus cases sharply decreased after the COVID-19 outbreak. The weekly case numbers of all viral diseases markedly decreased in both countries; however, bacterial gastrointestinal infectious diseases showed a different pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of gastrointestinal infectious diseases decreased after the COVID-19 outbreak. In contrast, Campylobacter infections showed an increasing trend in Korea, but a decreasing trend in the United States. Further studies are needed to elucidate the different trends in bacterial and viral infectious diseases before and after non-pharmaceutical interventions and between different countries.","['Kim S', 'Kim J', 'Choi BY', 'Park B']",2022,44,,Epidemiol Health,"Kim S, et al.

34938284,TNFRSF11B Suppresses Memory CD4+ T Cell Infiltration in the Colon Cancer Microenvironment: A Multiomics Integrative Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a lethal cancer worldwide. Due to the low tumor mutation burden and low proportion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the microenvironment of most patients, innovative immunotherapeutic approaches need to be identified.
METHODS: Using the TCGA-COAD dataset (n = 514), we identified TNFRSF11B as a prognostic factor of colon cancer. An immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset (n = 86), 290 single colorectal cancer cells (GSE81861), and 31 paired colon cancer transcriptional datasets were further applied to validate the function of TNFRSF11B, which was confirmed 
RESULTS: A risk score system consisting of eight immune-related genes (IRGs) (FGFR2, ZC3HAV1L, TNFRSF11B, CD79A, IGHV3-11, IGHV3-21, IGKV2D-30, and IGKV6D-21) was constructed to predict the prognosis of colon cancer patients. Only TNFRSF11B was closely correlated with late-stage lymph node metastasis and worse survival outcomes (

Individuals living in areas that lack access to clean water and sanitation are the most affected. Even though infection can be treated with antibiotics, Shigella antimicrobial drug resistance complicates clinical management. Despite decades of effort, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent shigellosis. The highly conserved invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa), which are components of the Shigella type III secretion system, participate in bacterial epithelial cell invasion and have been pursued as vaccine targets. However, expression and purification of these proteins in conventional cell-based systems have been challenging due to solubility issues and extremely low recovery yields. These difficulties have impeded manufacturing and clinical advancement.

34788068,Selection for Phage Resistance Reduces Virulence of Shigella flexneri.,"There is an increasing interest in phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections, especially using phages that select for evolutionary trade-offs between increased phage resistance and decreased fitness traits, such as virulence, in target bacteria. A vast repertoire of virulence factors allows the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri to invade human gut epithelial cells, replicate intracellularly, and evade host immunity through intercellular spread. It has been previously shown that OmpA is necessary for the intercellular spread of S. flexneri. We hypothesized that a phage which uses OmpA as a receptor to infect S. flexneri should select for phage-resistant mutants with attenuated intercellular spread. Here, we show that phage A1-1 requires OmpA as a receptor and selects for reduced virulence in S. flexneri. We characterized five phage-resistant mutants by measuring phenotypic changes in various traits: cell-membrane permeability, total lipopolysaccharide (LPS), sensitivity to antibiotics, and susceptibility to other phages. The results separated the mutants into two groups: R1 and R2 phenotypically resembled ","['Kortright KE', 'Done RE', 'Chan BK', 'Souza V', 'Turner PE']",2022,88,2,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Kortright KE, et al.

The phage therapy has been proven as an effective alternative strategy for controlling Shigella infections. In this study, we illustrate the isolation and detailed characterization of a polyvalent phage 2019SD1, which demonstrates lytic activity against Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus saccharolyticus and Enterococcus faecium. The newly isolated phage 2019SD1 shows adsorption time < 6 min, a latent period of 20 min and burst size of 151 PFU per bacterial cell. 2019SD1 exhibits considerable stability in a wide pH range and survives an hour at 50 °C. Under transmission electron microscope, 2019SD1 shows an icosahedral capsid (60 nm dia) and a 140 nm long tail. Further, detailed bioinformatic analyses of whole genome sequence data obtained through Oxford Nanopore platform revealed that 2019SD1 belongs to genus Hanrivervirus of subfamily Tempevirinae under the family Drexlerviridae. The concatenated protein phylogeny of 2019SD1 with the members of Drexlerviridae taking four genes (DNA Primase, ATP Dependent DNA Helicase, Large Terminase Protein, and Portal Protein) using the maximum parsimony method also suggested that 2019SD1 formed a distinct clade with the closest match of the taxa belonging to the genus Hanrivervirus. The genome analysis data indicate the occurrence of putative tail fiber proteins and DNA methylation mechanism. In addition, 2019SD1 has a well-established anti-host defence system as suggested through identification of putative anti-CRISPR and anti-restriction endonuclease systems thereby also indicating its biocontrol potential.","['Kumar P', 'Meghvansi MK', 'Kamboj DV']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Kumar P, et al.

Shigellosis most commonly affects children younger than 5 years; however, clusters and outbreaks of shigellosis have been reported among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Evidence suggests that knowledge of shigellosis among MSM is low, indicating health promotion outreach is needed for this population.
METHODS: To inform the development of shigellosis-related health communication materials and strategies, 6 focus groups were conducted in 2017, in Atlanta, GA among 24 self-identified gay and bisexual men. Participants were asked about their preferences and recommendations for health communication materials.
RESULTS: Participants indicated they would prefer a range of physical and virtual materials placed in diverse locations where the community would see them. Respondents recommended health messages be simple, quick to read, and concise with limited word counts. Participants also advised the use of diverse images that were inclusive of couples of varying sexual orientations to reduce stigma. Participants advocated for the use of humor and provocative images to increase user engagement.
CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the potential benefits of conducting formative research when designing health communication materials. Incorporating messaging preferences of MSM in the development of shigellosis-related health communication materials could enhance their relevance for the target population while also avoiding unintended consequences associated with stigmatizing MSM.","['Respress E', 'Evener SL', 'Caruso E', 'Jacobson K', 'Bowen A', 'Kachur RE', 'Garcia-Williams AG', 'Wright ER']",2022,49,4,Sex Transm Dis,"Respress E, et al.

We adopted a number of computational approaches to predict potential epitope-based vaccine candidates of immunogenic proteins of Shigella spp. We selected three cell surface proteins of the bacterium according to their antigenicity using the VaxiJen server, including, FepA, Maltoporin, and OmpW. The sequence analyses by the IEDB server resulted in three 15-mer peptides of the core epitope, FTAEHTQSV, FLVNQTLTL, and MRAGSATVR from FepA, Maltoporin, and OmpW, respectively, as the most potential epitopes that have an affinity with both cytotoxic and helper T-cells. Moreover, the epitopes showed 73.76%, 99.0%, and 93.07% world population coverage, along with 100% conservancy among the Shigella subspecies. The molecular docking simulation studies were performed to verify the interactions between the peptides and the respective HLAs. Docking analyses showed that the Epitope-MHC complexes had a higher level of global energy score dictating strong binding. We have also predicted B-cell epitopes from the sequences of these three proteins.

34673959,Genomic epidemiology of persistently circulating MDR Shigella sonnei strains associated with men who have sex with men (MSM) in Belgium (2013-19).,"OBJECTIVES: Shigella sonnei resistant to first-line antibiotics azithromycin and ciprofloxacin are on the rise globally. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of MDR S. sonnei in Belgium and to identify origins and circulating clusters through WGS.
METHODS: We undertook demographic, temporal and geographical analysis of 930 S. sonnei isolates submitted to the Belgian National Reference Centre for Salmonella and Shigella between 2017 and 2019. Phylogenetic analysis of WGS data, genotyping and identification of genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance was performed on 372 Belgian isolates submitted between 2013 and 2019.
RESULTS: S. sonnei was identified in 75% (930/1253) of Belgian Shigella isolates submitted between 2017 and 2019. Overall, 7% (69/930) of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin alone, 6% (57/930) showed reduced susceptibility to azithromycin alone, and 24% (223/930) exhibited both. Men were at higher risk of carrying a double resistant S. sonnei strain, compared with women (risk ratio = 8.6, 95% CI = 5.4-13.9). Phylogenetic analysis revealed four independent Belgian clusters of persistently circulating MDR strains, associated with men who have sex with men (MSM) and of the same genotypes as previously described international MSM-related clades. Belgian isolates carried various incompatibility (Inc)-type plasmids, the SpA plasmid and ESBL genes.
CONCLUSIONS: In Belgium, S. sonnei isolates from men are much more likely to be resistant to important first-line antibiotics than isolates from women. Multiple co-circulating MDR S. sonnei clusters of different genotypes were identified in the MSM community. Further studies on risk groups are needed for targeted prevention, improved clinical and public health management and antimicrobial stewardship in Belgium.","['Fischer N', 'Maex M', 'Mattheus W', 'Van den Bossche A', 'Van Cauteren D', 'Laisnez V', 'Hammami N', 'Ceyssens PJ']",2021,77,1,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Fischer N, et al.

34608697,Shigella flexneri subverts host polarized exocytosis to enhance cell-to-cell spread.,"Shigella flexneri is a gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes dysentery. Critical for disease is the ability of Shigella to use an actin-based motility (ABM) process to spread between cells of the colonic epithelium. ABM transports bacteria to the periphery of host cells, allowing the formation of plasma membrane protrusions that mediate spread to adjacent cells. Here we demonstrate that efficient protrusion formation and cell-to-cell spread of Shigella involves bacterial stimulation of host polarized exocytosis. Using an exocytic probe, we found that exocytosis is locally upregulated in bacterial protrusions in a manner that depends on the Shigella type III secretion system. Experiments involving RNA interference (RNAi) indicate that efficient bacterial protrusion formation and spread require the exocyst, a mammalian multi-protein complex known to mediate polarized exocytosis. In addition, the exocyst component Exo70 and the exocyst regulator RalA were recruited to Shigella protrusions, suggesting that bacteria manipulate exocyst function. Importantly, RNAi-mediated depletion of exocyst proteins or RalA reduced the frequency of protrusion formation and also the lengths of protrusions, demonstrating that the exocyst controls both the initiation and elongation of protrusions. Collectively, our results reveal that Shigella co-opts the exocyst complex to disseminate efficiently in host cell monolayers.","['Herath TUB', 'Roy A', 'Gianfelice A', 'Ireton K']",2021,116,5,Mol Microbiol,"Herath TUB, et al.

34602058,"Spatio-temporal analysis of bacillary dysentery in Sichuan province, China, 2011-2019.","BACKGROUND: Bacillary dysentery (BD) is a common infectious disease in China and causes enormous economic burdens. The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiological characteristics of BD and to identify its possible hot spots and potentially high-risk areas in Sichuan province of China.
METHODS: In this study, we collected monthly BD incidence reports of 181 counties in Sichuan province, China, from January 2011 to December 2019. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of BD. Moran's I index was applied to investigate the yearly patterns of the spatial distribution. And spatio-temporal scanning statistics with the spatial unit set as county and the temporal unit set as month were used to investigate the possible high-risk region. Meanwhile, the circular moving windows were also employed in the spatio-temporal scanning to scan the study areas.
RESULTS: The annual incidence of BD ranged between 16.13/100,000 and 6.17/100,000 person-years from 2011 to 2019 in Sichuan. The majority of the cases were children aged 5 years or younger. For the descriptive statistics, a peak from May to October was observed in temporal analysis, the epidemics were mainly concentrated in the northwest and southwest of Sichuan in spatial analysis. After 2016, the scope of BD significantly narrowed and severe epidemic areas were relatively stable. For the spatial autocorrelation analysis, a high global autocorrelation was observed at the county level, and the high-high clusters mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest of Sichuan. For the spatio-temporal scanning, the spatiotemporal clusters of BD occurred every year from 2011 to 2019. The most likely cluster areas mainly distributed in the southwest and northwest of Sichuan at the beginning, and then gradually concentrated in the southwest. The secondary cluster mainly concentrated in the northwest and its surrounding areas. Moreover, the 2nd secondary cluster was relatively small and mainly distributed in the central area. No clusters were noted in eastern Sichuan.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our current analysis, BD is still a common challenge in Sichuan, especially for counties in the southwest and northwest in summer and autumn. More disease prevention and control measures should be taken in such higher-risk susceptible areas at a certain time to allocate the public health resources rationally, and finally reduce the spread of BD.","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang M', 'Kang D', 'Sun W', 'Yang C', 'Wei R']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Zhang Y, et al.

An increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant Shigella species has revived the importance of bacteriophages as an alternative therapy to antibiotics. In this study, a novel bacteriophage, Sfk20, has been isolated from water bodies of a diarrheal outbreak area in Kolkata (India) with lytic activity against many Shigella spp. Phage Sfk20 showed a latent period of 20 min and a large burst size of 123 pfu per infected cell in a one-step growth analysis. Phage-host interaction and lytic activity confirmed by phage attachment, intracellular phage development, and bacterial cell burst using ultrathin sectioning and TEM analysis. The genomic analysis revealed that the double-stranded DNA genome of Sfk20 contains 164,878 bp with 35.62% G + C content and 241 ORFs. Results suggested phage Sfk20 to include as a member of the T4 myoviridae bacteriophage group. Phage Sfk20 has shown anti-biofilm potential against Shigella species.

34499700,The type 3 secretion system requires actin polymerization to open translocon pores.,"Many bacterial pathogens require a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) to establish a niche. Host contact activates bacterial T3SS assembly of a translocon pore in the host plasma membrane. Following pore formation, the T3SS docks onto the translocon pore. Docking establishes a continuous passage that enables the translocation of virulence proteins, effectors, into the host cytosol. Here we investigate the contribution of actin polymerization to T3SS-mediated translocation. Using the T3SS model organism Shigella flexneri, we show that actin polymerization is required for assembling the translocon pore in an open conformation, thereby enabling effector translocation. Opening of the pore channel is associated with a conformational change to the pore, which is dependent upon actin polymerization and a coiled-coil domain in the pore protein IpaC. Analysis of an IpaC mutant that is defective in ruffle formation shows that actin polymerization-dependent pore opening is distinct from the previously described actin polymerization-dependent ruffles that are required for bacterial internalization. Moreover, actin polymerization is not required for other pore functions, including docking or pore protein insertion into the plasma membrane. Thus, activation of the T3SS is a multilayered process in which host signals are sensed by the translocon pore leading to the activation of effector translocation.","['Russo BC', 'Duncan-Lowey JK', 'Chen P', 'Goldberg MB']",2021,17,9,PLoS Pathog,"Russo BC, et al.

With the increasing severity of Shigella infection, lyase has been considered as the most promising alternative to antimicrobial agents, owing to the emergence of resistant bacteria and the difficulty in disrupting and eliminating bacterial biofilms. In this study, we cloned and characterised HolSSE1 and LysSSE1, holin, and lysozyme from the S. dysenteriae phage SSE1 with extended bacterial host range against common gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the efficacy of HolSSE1 and LysSSE1 in removing bacterial biofilms was observed on polystyrene surfaces. Moreover, synergistic bacteriostasis was observed when they were used together. Alignment and structural model analysis showed that both HolSSE1 and LysSSE1 are T4 phage proteins that have not yet been identified. Therefore, HolSSE1 and LysSSE1 can be promising biocontrol agents for the prevention and treatment of various pathogenic infections.","['Lu H', 'Xiong W', 'Li Z', 'Liu B', 'Liu R', 'Liu X']",2021,116,,Bioorg Chem,"Lu H, et al.

34482641,"Examination of Australian backyard poultry for Salmonella, Campylobacter and Shigella spp., and related risk factors.","Worldwide, foodborne illness is a significant public health issue in both developed and developing countries. Salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis and shigellosis are common foodborne gastrointestinal illnesses caused by the bacteria Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Shigella spp. respectively. These zoonotic diseases are frequently linked to eggs and poultry products. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of these pathogens in Australian backyard poultry flocks and to determine risk factors for these pathogens. Poultry faeces samples were collected from 82 backyards and screened for Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Shigella spp. using qPCR. A questionnaire was administered to the backyard poultry owners to assess their knowledge regarding management of poultry and eggs and to identify potential risk factors that may contribute to the presence of zoonotic pathogens in the flocks. One composite faecal sample was collected from each backyard (82 samples). Composite sampling here means taking one or more grab samples from a backyard to make up approximately 10 grams. Four per cent of samples, that is 4% backyards tested, were positive for Salmonella spp., 10% were positive for Campylobacter spp. and none were positive for Shigella spp. A higher infection rate was seen in multi-aged flocks (24%) compared with the single-aged flocks (3%). The survey found that many participants were engaging in risky food safety behaviours with 46% of participants responding that they washed their eggs with running water or still water instead of wiping the dirt off with a damp cloth to clean the eggs and 19% stored their eggs at room temperature. This study demonstrated that backyard poultry may pose a potential risk for salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. Additionally, Australian public health and food safety regulations should be modified and effectively implemented to address the risks associated with backyard poultry husbandry.","['Keerthirathne TP', 'Ross K', 'Fallowfield H', 'Whiley H']",2022,69,1,Zoonoses Public Health,"Keerthirathne TP, et al.

Chimeric proteins carrying immunogens increase immune response. In-silico tools are applied to design vaccine candidates. Invasion plasmid antigens D (ipaD) gene is one of the Shigella virulence factors. The N-terminal region of the IpaD plays a significant role in invading the host cell. Invasion protein H (invH) gene plays important role in bacterial adherence and entry into epithelial cells. A recombinant chimeric construct, containing IpaD and InvH was designed and used as a vaccine candidate against Shigella and Salmonella enteritidis. After bioinformatics assessments, the construct was designed, synthesized, and expressed in E.coli. Chimeric protein, IpaD, and InvH were purified with Ni-NTA chromatography. Purified proteins were confirmed with western blotting and then were injected into separate mice groups. The antibody titer was estimated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mice were challenged with 10, 100, and 1000 LD50 of Salmonella, and the sereny test was performed for Shigella. The Codon adaptation index of the chimeric gene was increased to 0.84. Validation results showed that 97.9% of residues lie in the favored or additional allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. A significant antibody rise was observed in all test groups. The immunized mice with chimer and InvH could tolerate 100 LD50 of Salmonella. In the sereny test, the application of bacteria treated with immunized mice sera of both antigens showed no infection in Guinea pigs' eyes. The recombinant protein could protect animal models against Salmonella and Shigella and therefore can be considered as a suitable vaccine candidate against these two pathogens.","['Emami Mahmoudabadi FS', 'Vakili A', 'Nazarian S', 'Amani J', 'Mousavi Gargari SL']",2021,20,4,Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Emami Mahmoudabadi FS, et al.

34387025,Unraveling a Ligand-Induced Twist of a Homodimeric Enzyme by Pulsed Electron-Electron Double Resonance.,"Mechanistic insights into protein-ligand interactions can yield chemical tools for modulating protein function and enable their use for therapeutic purposes. For the homodimeric enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a putative virulence target of shigellosis, ligand binding has been shown by crystallography to transform the functional dimer geometry into an incompetent twisted one. However, crystallographic observation of both end states does neither verify the ligand-induced transformation of one dimer into the other in solution nor does it shed light on the underlying transformation mechanism. We addressed these questions in an approach that combines site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) with distance measurements based on pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR or DEER) spectroscopy. We observed an equilibrium between the functional and twisted dimer that depends on the type of ligand, with a pyranose-substituted ligand being the most potent one in shifting the equilibrium toward the twisted dimer. Our experiments suggest a dissociation-association mechanism for the formation of the twisted dimer upon ligand binding.","['Nguyen D', 'Abdullin D', 'Heubach CA', 'Pfaffeneder T', 'Nguyen A', 'Heine A', 'Reuter K', 'Diederich F', 'Schiemann O', 'Klebe G']",2021,60,43,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,"Nguyen D, et al.

Here, we describe functional antibody and innate immune responses to WRSS1.
METHODS: Adults (18-39 years) and children (5-9 years) received 3 doses of 3 × 105 or 3 × 106 colony forming units (CFU) of WRSS1 or placebo, 4 weeks apart; children additionally received 3 × 104 CFU. Blood and stool were collected at baseline and 7 days after each dose. Functional antibodies were measured using serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) assay. Cytokine/chemokine concentrations were measured in lymphocyte cultures. Host defense peptides LL-37, HBD-1, and HD-5 were analyzed in plasma and stool.
RESULTS: Children showed increased SBA titers over baseline after the third dose of 3 × 106 CFU (P = .048). Significant increases of Th-17 and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, G-CSF, MIP-1β), and reduction of anti-inflammatory and Th2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-13, GM-CSF) were observed in children.

34303970,The exposure-response association between humidex and bacillary dysentery: A two-stage time series analysis of 316 cities in mainland China.,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported the interactive effects between relative humidity and temperature on infectious diseases. However, evidence regarding the combined effects of relative humidity and temperature on bacillary dysentery (BD) is limited, especially for large-scale studies. To address this research need, humidex was utilized as a comprehensive index of relative humidity and temperature. We aimed to estimate the effect of humidex on BD across mainland China, evaluate its heterogeneity, and identify potential effect modifiers.
METHODS: Daily meteorological and BD surveillance data from 2014 to 2016 were obtained for 316 prefecture-level cities in mainland China. Humidex was calculated on the basis of relative humidity and temperature. A multicity, two-stage time series analysis was then performed. In the first stage, a common distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was established to obtain city-specific estimates. In the second stage, a multivariate meta-analysis was conducted to pool these estimates, assess the significance of heterogeneity, and explore potential effect modifiers.
RESULTS: The pooled cumulative estimates showed that humidex could promote the transmission of BD. The exposure-response relationship was nearly linear, with a maximum cumulative relative risk (RR) of 1.45 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-1.63] at a humidex value of 40.94. High humidex had an acute adverse effect on BD. The humidex-BD relationship could be modified by latitude, urbanization rate, the natural growth rate of population, and the number of primary school students per thousand persons.
CONCLUSIONS: High humidex could increase the risk of BD incidence. Thus, it is suitable to incorporate humidex as a predictor into the early warning system of BD and to inform the general public in advance to be cautious when humidex is high. This is especially true for regions with higher latitude, higher urbanization rates, lower natural growth rates of population, and lower numbers of primary school students per thousand persons.","['Zhao R', 'Gao Q', 'Hao Q', 'Wang S', 'Zhang Y', 'Li H', 'Jiang B']",2021,797,,Sci Total Environ,"Zhao R, et al.

34301939,Mechanistic insight into bacterial entrapment by septin cage reconstitution.,"Septins are cytoskeletal proteins that assemble into hetero-oligomeric complexes and sense micron-scale membrane curvature. During infection with Shigella flexneri, an invasive enteropathogen, septins restrict actin tail formation by entrapping bacteria in cage-like structures. Here, we reconstitute septin cages in vitro using purified recombinant septin complexes (SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7), and study how these recognize bacterial cells and assemble on their surface. We show that septin complexes recognize the pole of growing Shigella cells. An amphipathic helix domain in human SEPT6 enables septins to sense positively curved membranes and entrap bacterial cells. Shigella strains lacking lipopolysaccharide components are more efficiently entrapped in septin cages. Finally, cryo-electron tomography of in vitro cages reveals how septins assemble as filaments on the bacterial cell surface.","['Lobato-Márquez D', 'Xu J', 'Güler GÖ', 'Ojiakor A', 'Pilhofer M', 'Mostowy S']",2021,12,1,Nat Commun,"Lobato-Márquez D, et al.

34280580,Therapeutic target identification via differential genome analysis of antibiotic resistant Shigella sonnei and inhibitor evaluation against a selected drug target.,"Shigella sonnei has been implicated in bloody diarrhea (accompanied by abdominal pain and fever) and is an emerging pathogen of concern, especially in developing countries. The major means of transmission is the fecal-oral route while sexual transmission has also been reported. In children, the impact might be stunted growth due to life-threatening illness. Resistance has been reported in this species for several types of antibiotics. In this study, we retrieved the antibiotic-resistant labeled whole genome sequences of the species from the PATRIC database and performed a pan-genome analysis to filter out core genes. Antibiotic resistance was studied in the core, accessory and unique genome. Core genes were utilized as seed substance for essentiality analysis and drug candidate assignment. Product of the gene aroG, i.e. chorismate biosynthetic process 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase enzyme, responsible for aromatic amino acid family biosynthetic process, was taken for further downstream processing. Natural product libraries of flavonoids (n = 178), ZINC database derived inhibitor compounds of the 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase enzyme (n = 112), and streptomycin compounds (n = 737) were docked to find out potent inhibitors, followed by dynamics simulation of 50 ns each for top compounds.. Physicochemical and ADMET profiling of the top compounds was done to analyze their safety for consumption. We propose that the top compounds: Phytoene from Streptomycin library and ZINC000036444158 (synonym:1,16-bis[(dihydroxyphosphinyl)oxy]hexadecane) from 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase inhibitor library of ZINC database (and used as a control in this study) should be tested in vitro against Shigella sonnei, to fully determine their efficacy.

34271864,Virulence factors and molecular characteristics of Shigella flexneri isolated from calves with diarrhea.,"BACKGROUND: The natural hosts of Shigella are typically humans and other primates, but it has been shown that the host range of Shigella has expanded to many animals. Although Shigella is becoming a major threat to animals, there is limited information on the genetic background of local strains. The purpose of this study was to assess the presence of virulence factors and the molecular characteristics of S. flexneri isolated from calves with diarrhea.
RESULTS: Fifty-four S. flexneri isolates from Gansun, Shanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang and Tibet obtained during 2014 to 2016 possessed four typical biochemical characteristics of Shigella. The prevalences of ipaH, virA, ipaBCD, ial, sen, set1A, set1B and stx were 100 %, 100 %, 77.78 %, 79.63 %, 48.15 %, 48.15 and 0 %, respectively. Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) based on 8 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci discriminated the isolates into 39 different MLVA types (MTs), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) based on NotI digestion divided the 54 isolates into 31 PFGE types (PTs), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on 15 housekeeping genes differentiated the isolates into 7 MLST sequence types (STs).

34251610,How microbiological tests reflect bacterial pathogenesis and host adaptation.,"Historically, clinical microbiological laboratories have often relied on isolation of pure cultures and phenotypic testing to identify microorganisms. These clinical tests are often based on specific biochemical reactions, growth characteristics, colony morphology, and other physiological aspects. The features used for identification in clinical laboratories are highly conserved and specific for a given group of microbes. We speculate that these features might be the result of evolutionary selection and thus may reflect aspects of the life cycle of the organism and pathogenesis. Indeed, several of the metabolic pathways targeted by diagnostic tests in some cases may represent mechanisms for host colonization or pathogenesis. Examples include, but are not restricted to, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC). Here, we provide an overview of how some common tests reflect molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis.","['Spiga L', 'Jimenez AG', 'Santos RL', 'Winter SE']",2021,52,4,Braz J Microbiol,"Spiga L, et al.

34245714,Global projections of temperature-attributable mortality due to enteric infections: a modelling study.,"BACKGROUND: Mortality due to enteric infections is projected to increase because of global warming; however, the different temperature sensitivities of major enteric pathogens have not yet been considered in projections on a global scale. We aimed to project global temperature-attributable enteric infection mortality under various future scenarios of sociodemographic development and climate change.
METHODS: In this modelling study, we generated global projections in two stages. First, we forecasted baseline mortality from ten enteropathogens (non-typhoidal salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, cholera, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic E coli, typhoid, rotavirus, norovirus, and Cryptosporidium) under several future sociodemographic development and health investment scenarios (ie, pessimistic, intermediate, and optimistic). We then estimated the mortality change from baseline attributable to global warming using the product of projected annual temperature anomalies and pathogen-specific temperature sensitivities.
FINDINGS: We estimated that in the period 2080-95, the global mean number of temperature-attributable deaths due to enteric infections could be as low as 6599 (95% empirical CI 5441-7757) under the optimistic sociodemographic development and climate change scenario, or as high as 83 888 (67 760-100 015) under the pessimistic scenario. Most of the projected temperature-attributable deaths were from shigellosis, cryptosporidiosis, and typhoid fever in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Considerable reductions in the number of attributable deaths were from viral infections, such as rotaviral and noroviral enteritis, which resulted in net reductions in attributable enteric infection mortality under optimistic scenarios for Latin America and the Caribbean and East Asia and the Pacific.
INTERPRETATION: Temperature-attributable mortality could increase under warmer climate and unfavourable sociodemographic conditions. Mitigation policies for limiting global warming and sociodemographic development policies for low-income and middle-income countries might help reduce mortality from enteric infections in the future.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of infectious diseases in northern Iran with an approach to internal medicine management.
METHODS: This cross-sectional research was conducted in 2019 on all 7095 infectious diseases patient records that referred to Ghaemshahr Razi Hospital, Mazandaran Province, Iran during 2012-2018. A checklist prepared by investigator was used to collect the data. The extracted data were coded and entered into SPSS 22 and analyzed using K
RESULTS: The mean age of the study patients was 29.7±26.4. 4372 (61%) of the cases were males and the mean duration of hospitalization was 41.6±33.5. Age was significantly correlated to infectious diseases (P=.001). Gastroenteritis was the most common infectious disease among the men and women with 2442 (60.5%) and 1594 (39.47%), respectively. Based on the Pearson's correlation test, the relationship between leptospirosis, brucellosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, shigellosis, sepsis and infectious mononucleosis with gender, habitation, admission mode, discharged mode and age was significant (p<.05).
CONCLUSION: As the high frequent diseases were gastroenteritis, leptospirosis, brucellosis and sepsis and an increasing trend was in the prevalence of gastroenteritis, leptospirosis and lung tuberculosis, health system managers should consider training courses, preventive strategies, real-time interventions, increased hospital bed rate for patients with infectious diseases and so on.","['Jahani MA', 'Alinasab Z', 'Rezapour M', 'Omrani Nava M', 'Mahmoudi G']",2021,12,3,Caspian J Intern Med,"Jahani MA, et al.

The generalized estimating equations multivariable model identified a negative association between Shigella and weight-for-height z score [aOR - 0.11; (95% CI - 0.21, - 0.001)]; a positive association between symptomatic Campylobacter and weight-for-age z score [aOR 0.22; (95% CI 0.06, 0.37)] and weight-for-height z score [aOR 0.22; (95% CI 0.08, 0.37)]. Total costs incurred by households were more in shigellosis children than Campylobacter-induced enteritis ($4.27 vs. $3.49). Households with low-level maternal education tended to incur less cost in case of their shigellosis children. Our findings underscore the need for preventive strategies targeting Shigella infection, which could potentially reduce the disease burden, associated household costs, and child growth faltering.","['Das R', 'Haque MA', 'Chisti MJ', 'Faruque ASG', 'Ahmed T']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Das R, et al.

However, the age-related factors involved in transmission of shigellosis are unclear. An age-specific Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious/Asymptomatic-Recovered (SEIAR) model was applied to shigellosis surveillance data maintained by Hubei Province Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2005 to 2017. The individuals were divided into four age groups (≤ 5 years, 6-24 years, 25-59 years, and ≥ 60 years). The effective reproduction number (Reff), including infectivity (RI) and susceptibility (RS) was calculated to assess the transmissibility of different age groups. From 2005 to 2017, 130,768 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model fitted well with the reported data (P < 0.001). The highest transmissibility (Reff) was from ≤ 5 years to the 25-59 years (mean: 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-1.17), followed by from the 6-24 years to the 25-59 years (mean: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.35-1.02), from the ≥ 60 years to the 25-59 years (mean: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.29-0.86), and from the 25-59 years to 25-59 years (mean: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.21-0.78). The highest infectivity was in ≤ 5 years (RI = 1.71), and was most commonly transmitted to the 25-59 years (45.11%). The highest susceptibility was in the 25-59 years (RS = 2.51), and their most common source was the ≤ 5 years (30.15%). Furthermore, ""knock out"" simulation predicted the greatest reduction in the number of cases occurred by when cutting off transmission routes among ≤ 5 years and from 25-59 years to ≤ 5 years. Transmission in ≤ 5 years occurred mainly within the group, but infections were most commonly introduced by individuals in the 25-59 years. Infectivity was highest in the ≤ 5 years and susceptibility was highest in the 25-59 years. Interventions to stop transmission should be directed at these age groups.","['Zhao Z', 'Chen Q', 'Wang Y', 'Chu M', 'Hu Q', 'Hannah MN', 'Rui J', 'Liu X', 'Yu Y', 'Zhao F', 'Ren Z', 'Yu S', 'An R', 'Pan L', 'Chiang YC', 'Zhao B', 'Su Y', 'Zhao B', 'Chen T']",2021,15,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zhao Z, et al.

34057249,"2021 European Guideline on the management of proctitis, proctocolitis and enteritis caused by sexually transmissible pathogens.","This guideline intents to offer guidance on the diagnosis and management of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and a suspected sexually transmitted cause. Proctitis is defined as an inflammatory syndrome of the anal canal and/or the rectum. Infectious proctitis can be sexually transmitted via genital-anal mucosal contact, but some also via digital contact and toys. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis (including lymphogranuloma venereum), Treponema pallidum and herpes simplex virus are the most common sexually transmitted anorectal pathogens. Shigellosis can be transferred via oral-anal contact and may lead to proctocolitis or enteritis. Although most studies on these infections have concentrated on men who have sex with men (MSM), women having anal intercourse may also be at risk. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of proctitis can be made when there are symptoms and signs, and a definitive diagnosis when the results of laboratory tests are available. The symptoms of proctitis include anorectal itching, pain, tenesmus, bleeding, constipation and discharge in and around the anal canal. The majority of rectal chlamydia and gonococcal infections are asymptomatic and can only be detected by laboratory tests. Therefore, especially when there is a history of receptive anal contact, exclusion of anorectal infections is generally indicated as part of standard screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Condom use does not guarantee protection from STIs, which are often spread without penile penetration. New in this updated guideline is: (i) lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis is increasingly found in HIV-negative MSM, (ii) anorectal Mycoplasma genitalium infection should be considered in patients with symptomatic proctitis after exclusion of other common causations such N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, syphilis and herpes, (iii) intestinal spirochetosis incidentally found in colonic biopsies should not be confused with syphilis, and (iv) traumatic causes of proctitis should be considered in sexually active patients.","['de Vries HJC', 'Nori AV', 'Kiellberg Larsen H', 'Kreuter A', 'Padovese V', 'Pallawela S', 'Vall-Mayans M', 'Ross J']",2021,35,7,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"de Vries HJC, et al. 2021 European Guideline on the management of proctitis, proctocolitis and enteritis caused by sexually transmissible pathogens. 2021 European Guideline on the management of proctitis, proctocolitis and enteritis caused by sexually transmissible pathogens. 2021; 35:1434-1443. doi: 10.1111/jdv.17269",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34057249/

A total of 1,020 different samples were collected from various areas of Peshawar between January 2016 and May 2017, followed by identification of S. flexneri through biochemical, serological, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Potential risk factors associated with the development and spreading of S. flexneri infection were also investigated. Overall, 45 (4.41%) samples were positive for Shigella species. Among these samples, the predominant species was S. flexneri (n = 44) followed by S. boydii (n = 1). Interestingly, S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae isolates were not found in any sample. The isolation rate of S. flexneri in drinking water samples, market raw milk, and fruits/vegetables from Peshawar were 6.47%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. The phylogenetic reconstruction showed genetic diversity among three clades, as clades I and II have isolates of S. flexneri that were circulating within the drinking water, milk, fruits/vegetables, while clade III isolates were recovered from milk samples. Most of S. flexneri were detected in June to September. Potential risk factors of S. flexneri were water sources contaminated by toilet wastes (p = 0.04), surface water drainage (p = 0.0002), hospital wastes (p = 0.01), unhygienic handling (p < 0.05), and transportation of raw food (p = 0.04). In conclusion, S. flexneri isolates of closely related lineage originating from non-clinical samples might be associated with an increased human risk to shigellosis in Pakistan, as significant numbers of S. flexneri were observed in the drinking water and retail raw food samples. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study demonstrated the presence of S. flexneri in drinking water and retail raw food samples which seem to possess a serious threat to public health. Potential sources of food and water contamination should properly be monitored by public health authorities to reduce cases of shigellosis.","['Nisa I', 'Qasim M', 'Driessen A', 'Nijland J', 'Rafiullah', 'Ali A', 'Mirza MR', 'Khan MA', 'Khan TA', 'Jalal A', 'Rahman H']",2021,86,6,J Food Sci,"Nisa I, et al.

34043697,Shigella-specific antibodies in the first year of life among Zambian infants: A longitudinal cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: Shigellosis, is a leading cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and related mortality in young children in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Knowledge on naturally acquired immunity can support the development of Shigella candidate vaccines mostly needed in LMICs. We aimed to quantify Shigella-specific antibodies of maternal origin and those naturally acquired in Zambian infants.
METHODS: Plasma samples collected from infants at age 6, 14 and 52-weeks were tested for Shigella (S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and A (IgA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: At 6 weeks infant age, the IgG geometric mean titres (GMT) against S. sonnei (N = 159) and S. flexneri 2a (N = 135) LPS were 311 (95% CI 259-372) and 446 (95% CI 343-580) respectively. By 14 weeks, a decline in IgG GMT was observed for both S. sonnei to 104 (95% CI 88-124), and S. flexneri 2a to 183 (95% CI 147-230). Both S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a specific IgG GMT continued to decrease by 52 weeks infant age when compared to 6 weeks. In 27% and 8% of infants a significant rise in titre (4 fold and greater) against S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei LPS, respectively, was detected between the ages of 14 and 52 weeks. IgA levels against both species LPS were very low at 6 and 14 weeks and raised significantly against S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei LPS in 29% and 10% of the infants, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In our setting, transplacental IgG anti-Shigella LPS is present at high levels in early infancy, and begins to decrease by age 14 weeks. Our results are consistent with early exposure to Shigella and indicate naturally acquired IgG and IgA antibodies to S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei LPS in part of infants between 14 and 52 weeks of age. These results suggest that a potential timing of vaccination would be after 14 and before 52 weeks of age to ensure early infant protection against shigellosis.","['Chisenga CC', 'Bosomprah S', 'Simuyandi M', 'Mwila-Kazimbaya K', 'Chilyabanyama ON', 'Laban NM', 'Bialik A', 'Asato V', 'Meron-Sudai S', 'Frankel G', 'Cohen D', 'Chilengi R']",2021,16,5,PLoS One,"Chisenga CC, et al.

34037841,Biotechnological interventions and genetic diversity assessment in Swertia sp.: a myriad source of valuable secondary metabolites.,"The genus Swertia (Family: Gentianaceae) has cosmopolitan distribution which is present in almost all the continents except South America and Australia. Swertia genus has been renowned as one of the potent herbal drugs in the British, American, and Chinese Pharmacopeias as well as well-documented in the Indian traditional medicinal systems, viz. Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. Many species of this genus have therapeutic properties and have been used traditionally in the treatment of a number of health ailments viz. hepatitis, diabetes, inflammation, bacillary dysentery, cancer, malaria, fever etc. This genus is industrially important medicinal plant that has been used as a principal component in numerous marketed herbal/ polyherbal formulations. Medicinal usage of Swertia is endorsed to the miscellaneous compounds viz. xanthones, irridoids, seco-irridoids, and triterpenoids. A chain of systematic isolation of bio-active compounds and their diverse range of pharmacological effects during last 15-20 years proved this genus as industrially important plant. Due to the various practices of the Swertia species, annual demand is more than 100 tons per year for this important herb which is continuously increasing 10% annually. The market value rises 10% by the year as there is increased demand in national and international market resulted in adulteration of many Swertia spp. due to paucity of agricultural practices, exomorphological, phytochemical, and molecular characterization. Thus, efficient biotechnology methods are prerequisite for the mass production of authentic species, sustainable production of bio-active compounds and ex situ conservation. A chain of systematic biotechnological interventions in Swertia herb during last 20 years cover the assessment of genetic diversity, in vitro sustainable production of bio-active compounds and mass propagation of elite genotypes via direct and indirect organogenesis. This review attempts to present the comprehensive assessment on biotechnological process made in Swertia over the past few years.

34000445,Virulence profiling of Shigella flexneri and emergence of serotype 2b as a highly virulent shigellosis causing strain in Pakistan.,"Bacillary diarrhea caused by Shigella flexneri is mediated by various virulence factors which make it the leading agent of diarrhea in developing countries. Previously, a high prevalence of S. flexneri, associated with diarrhea has been reported in Pakistan but no data is available on their virulence profile. The present study reports for the first time analysis of various virulence factors among S. flexneri serotypes isolated from clinical (diarrheal stool) and non-clinical (retail raw foods and drinking water) sources. A total of 199 S. flexneri (clinical: 155, raw foods: 22, water: 22) belonging to various serotypes were subjected to virulence genes detection and virulence profiling. The most frequent virulence gene was found to be ipaH (100%), followed by sat (98%), ial (71.3%), set1B (65.8%) and set1A (38.7%). A high level of virulence was detected in serotype 2b as compared to other serotypes as 32.3% of all serotype 2b have the entire set of five virulence genes including ipaH (100%), ial (100%), sat (37.7%), set1A (89.3%), and set1B (100%). Seven different virulence gene profiles (V1 - V7) were detected and the most frequently observed to be V1 (ipaH+, ial+, sat+, set1A+, set1B+) followed by V3 (ipaH+, ial+, sat+, set1B+). The predominant virulence gene pattern in serotype 2b isolated from clinical and non-clinical samples were V1 and V3. Furthermore, about 32% strains belonging to serotype 2b contain the complete set of five virulence genes isolated from patients with high disease severity. In conclusion, the current finding revealed for the first times that serotype 2b was the most virulent strains in both clinical and non-clinical samples in Pakistan. In addition, the virulence of serotype 2b was well correlated with high disease severity.","['Nisa I', 'Qasim M', 'Driessen A', 'Nijland J', 'Adnan F', 'Shuja MN', 'Rahman H']",2021,93,,Infect Genet Evol,"Nisa I, et al.

33998043,In silico structure evaluation of BAG3 and elucidating its association with bacterial infections through protein-protein and host-pathogen interaction analysis.,"BAG3, a co-chaperone protein with a Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) domain, has diverse functionalities in protein-folding, apoptosis, inflammation, and cell cycle regulatory cross-talks. It has been well characterised in cardiac diseases, cancers, and viral pathogenesis. The multiple roles of BAG3 are attributed to its functional regions like BAG, Tryptophan-rich (WW), isoleucine-proline-valine-rich (IPV), and proline-rich (PXXP) domains. However, to study its structural impact on various functions, the experimental 3D structure of BAG3 protein was not available. Hence, the structure was predicted through in silico modelling and validated through computational tools and molecular dynamics simulation studies. To the best of our knowledge, the role of BAG3 in bacterial infections is not explicitly reported. We attempted to study them through an in-silico protein-protein interaction network and host-pathogen interaction analysis. From structure-function relationships, it was identified that the WW and PXXP domains were associated with cellular cytoskeleton rearrangement and adhesion-mediated response, which might be involved in BAG3-related intracellular bacterial proliferation. From functional enrichment analysis, Gene Ontology terms and topological matrices, 18 host proteins and 29 pathogen proteins were identified in the BAG3 interactome pertaining to Legionellosis, Tuberculosis, Salmonellosis, Shigellosis, and Pertussis through differential phosphorylation events associated with serine metabolism. Furthermore, it was evident that direct (MAPK8, MAPK14) and associated (MAPK1, HSPD1, NFKBIA, TLR2, RHOA) interactors of BAG3 could be considered as therapeutic markers to curb down intracellular bacterial propagation in humans.","['Basu S', 'Naha A', 'Veeraraghavan B', 'Ramaiah S', 'Anbarasu A']",2022,123,1,J Cell Biochem,"Basu S, et al.

Age group ⩾5 years was found to be more sensitive to the effects. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between temperature, humidity and precipitation (P = 0.004, 0.002, respectively) on BD under high temperature (>0 °C), reminding residents and policymakers to pay attention to the prevention of BD in situations with both high temperature and humidity, high temperature and precipitation during the temperate monsoon climate.","['Wang Y', 'Li M', 'Li Z', 'Chai R', 'Dong X', 'Xu H', 'Wang J', 'Yao L', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao Q', 'Yao Y']",2021,149,,Epidemiol Infect,"Wang Y, et al.

33874880,"Associations between floods and bacillary dysentery cases in main urban areas of Chongqing, China, 2005-2016: a retrospective study.","BACKGROUND: Understanding the association between floods and bacillary dysentery (BD) incidence is necessary for us to assess the health risk of extreme weather events. This study aims at exploring the association between floods and daily bacillary dysentery cases in main urban areas of Chongqing between 2005 and 2016 as well as evaluating the attributable risk from floods.
METHODS: The association between floods and daily bacillary dysentery cases was evaluated by using distributed lag non-linear model, controlling for meteorological factors, long-term trend, seasonality, and day of week. The fraction and number of bacillary dysentery cases attributable to floods was calculated. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the association across age, gender, and occupation.
RESULTS: After controlling the impact of temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, long-term trend, and seasonality, a significant lag effect of floods on bacillary dysentery cases was found at 0-day, 3-day, and 4-day lag, and the cumulative relative risk (CRR) over a 7-lag day period was 1.393 (95%CI 1.216-1.596). Male had higher risk than female. People under 5 years old and people aged 15-64 years old had significantly higher risk. Students, workers, and children had significantly higher risk. During the study period, based on 7-lag days, the attributable fraction of bacillary dysentery cases due to floods was 1.10% and the attributable number was 497 persons.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that floods can increase the risk of bacillary dysentery incidence in main urban areas of Chongqing within an accurate time scale, the risk of bacillary dysentery caused by floods is still serious. The key population includes male, people under 5 years old, students, workers, and children. Considering the lag effect of floods on bacillary dysentery, the government and public health emergency departments should advance to the emergency health response in order to minimize the potential risk of floods on public.","['Ma Y', 'Wen T', 'Xing D', 'Zhang Y']",2021,26,1,Environ Health Prev Med,"Ma Y, et al.

33862589,Human challenge study with a Shigella bioconjugate vaccine: Analyses of clinical efficacy and correlate of protection.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is a major cause of moderate to severe diarrhoea and dysentery in children under 5 years of age in low and middle-income countries. The Flexyn2a vaccine conjugates the O-polysaccharide of Shigella flexneri 2a to Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. We describe a Phase 2b proof-of-concept challenge study that evaluated safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the Flexyn2a vaccine to protect against shigellosis.
METHODS: In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy adults were randomized 1:1 to receive Flexyn2a (10 µg) or placebo intramuscularly, twice, 4 weeks apart, followed by challenge 4 weeks later with 1500 colony forming units (CFUs) of S. flexneri 2a strain 2457T. The primary outcome was vaccine-induced protection. S. flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific immune responses were assessed.
FINDINGS: Sixty-seven subjects were enrolled, 34 received vaccine and 33 placebo. The vaccine was well tolerated; the majority of adverse events were mild in nature. Thirty vaccinees and 29 placebo recipients received the S. flexneri 2a challenge. Vaccination resulted in a 30.2% reduction in shigellosis compared with placebo (13/30 vs. 18/29; p = 0.11; 95% CI -15 to 62.6). Vaccine efficacy was more robust against severe disease, reaching 51.7% (p = 0.015, 95% CI 5.3 to 77.9) against moderate/severe diarrhoea or dysentery concurrent with fever or severe enteric symptoms and 72.4% (p = 0.07) against more severe diarrhoea (≥10 lose stools or ≥1000 g loose stools/24 h). Vaccinated subjects were less likely to need early antibiotic intervention following challenge (protective efficacy 51.7%, p = 0.01; 95% CI 9 to 76.8). In those who developed shigellosis, vaccinated subjects had a lower disease severity score (p = 0.002) than placebo-recipients. Additionally, LPS-specific serum IgG responses in Flexyn2a recipients were associated with protection against disease (p = 0.0016) and with a decreased shigellosis disease score (p = 0.002).
INTERPRETATION: The Flexyn2a bioconjugate vaccine was immunogenic, well tolerated and protected against severe illness after Shigella challenge and is a promising Shigella vaccine construct. We identified a strong association between anti-S. flexneri 2a serum IgG and a reduction in disease outcomes. (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02646371.)

33848057,New methods to decrypt emerging macropinosome functions during the host-pathogen crosstalk.,"Large volumes of liquid and other materials from the extracellular environment are internalised by eukaryotic cells via an endocytic process called macropinocytosis. It is now recognised that this fundamental and evolutionarily conserved pathway is hijacked by numerous intracellular pathogens as an entry portal to the host cell interior. Yet, an increasing number of additional cellular functions of macropinosomes in pathologic processes have been reported beyond this role for fluid internalisation. It emerges that the identity of macropinosomes can vary hugely and change rapidly during their lifetime. A deeper understanding of this important multi-faceted compartment is based on novel methods for their investigation. These methods are either imaging-based for the tracking of macropinosome dynamics, or they provide the means to extract macropinosomes at high purity for comprehensive proteomic analyses. Here, we portray these new approaches for the investigation of macropinosomes. We document how these method developments have provided insights for a new understanding of the intracellular lifestyle of the bacterial pathogens Shigella and Salmonella. We suggest that a systematic complete characterisation of macropinosome subversion with these approaches during other infection processes and pathologies will be highly beneficial for our understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular processes.","['Chang YY', 'Enninga J', 'Stévenin V']",2021,23,7,Cell Microbiol,"Chang YY, et al.

33761190,"Laboratory-based surveillance of Shigella spp. from human clinical cases in Colombia, 1997-2018.","INTRODUCTION: Shigellosis is endemic in low-and middle-income countries, causing approximately 125 million episodes of diarrhea and leading to approximately 160 .000 deaths annually one-third of which is associated with children.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Shigella species recovered in Colombia from 1997 to 2018.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We received isolates from laboratories in 29 Colombian departments. We serotyped with specific antiserum and determined antimicrobial resistance and minimal inhibitory concentrations for ten antibiotics with Kirby-Bauer tests following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations.
RESULTS: We analyzed 5,251 isolates of Shigella spp., most of them obtained from stools (96.4%); 2,511 (47.8%) were from children under five years of age. The two most common species were S. sonnei (55.1%) and S. flexneri (41.7%). The highest resistance rate was that of tetracycline (88.1%) followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (79.3%) and ampicillin (65.5%); 50.8% of isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, 43.6% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and less than 1% to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. In S. sonnei, the most common resistance profile corresponded to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (92%) whereas in S. flexneri the most common antibiotic profiles were multidrug resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, children under five years are affected by all Shigella species. These findings should guide funders and public health officials to make evidence based decisions for protection and prevention measures. The antimicrobial resistance characteristics found in this study underline the importance of combating the dissemination of the most frequently isolated species, S. sonnei and S. flexneri.","['Rodríguez EC', 'Bautista AM', 'Montaño LA', 'Ovalle MV', 'Correa FP']",2021,41,1,Biomedica,"Rodríguez EC, et al.

33758907,Inflated false discovery rate due to volcano plots: problem and solutions.,"MOTIVATION: Volcano plots are used to select the most interesting discoveries when too many discoveries remain after application of Benjamini-Hochberg's procedure (BH). The volcano plot suggests a double filtering procedure that selects features with both small adjusted $P$-value and large estimated effect size. Despite its popularity, this type of selection overlooks the fact that BH does not guarantee error control over filtered subsets of discoveries. Therefore the selected subset of features may include an inflated number of false discoveries.
RESULTS: In this paper, we illustrate the substantially inflated type I error rate of volcano plot selection with simulation experiments and RNA-seq data. In particular, we show that the feature with the largest estimated effect is a very likely false positive result. Next, we investigate two alternative approaches for multiple testing with double filtering that do not inflate the false discovery rate. Our procedure is implemented in an interactive web application and is publicly available.","['Ebrahimpoor M', 'Goeman JJ']",2021,22,5,Brief Bioinform,Ebrahimpoor M and Goeman JJ.

Here, we interrogated a collection of 1,804 Shigella whole genome sequences from organisms isolated in four continental Southeast Asian countries (Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) over three decades to characterise the evolution of both S. flexneri and S. sonnei. We show that S. sonnei and each major S. flexneri serotype are comprised of genetically diverse populations, the majority of which were likely introduced into Southeast Asia in the 1970s-1990s. Intranational and regional dissemination allowed widespread propagation of both species across the region. Our data indicate that the epidemiology of S. sonnei and the major S. flexneri serotypes were characterised by frequent clonal replacement events, coinciding with changing susceptibility patterns against contemporaneous antimicrobials. We conclude that adaptation to antimicrobial pressure was pivotal to the recent evolutionary trajectory of Shigella in Southeast Asia.","['Chung The H', 'Bodhidatta L', 'Pham DT', 'Mason CJ', 'Ha Thanh T', 'Voong Vinh P', 'Turner P', 'Hem S', 'Dance DAB', 'Newton PN', 'Phetsouvanh R', 'Davong V', 'Thwaites GE', 'Thomson NR', 'Baker S', 'Rabaa MA']",2021,4,1,Commun Biol,"Chung The H, et al.

Specifically, attachment of a myristoyl group is vital for proteins participating in various biological functions, including signal transduction, cellular localization, and oncogenesis. Recent studies have revealed unexpected mechanisms indicating that protein N-myristoylation is involved in host defense against microbial and viral infections. In this review, we describe the current understanding of protein N-myristoylation (mainly focusing on myristoyl switches) and summarize its crucial roles in regulating innate immune responses, including TLR4-dependent inflammatory responses and demyristoylation-induced innate immunosuppression during Shigella flexneri infection. Furthermore, we examine the role of myristoylation in viral assembly, intracellular host interactions, and viral spread during human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. Deeper insight into the relationship between protein N-myristoylation and innate immunity might enable us to clarify the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases and better harness protein N-myristoylation for new therapeutics.","['Wang B', 'Dai T', 'Sun W', 'Wei Y', 'Ren J', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang M', 'Zhou F']",2021,18,4,Cell Mol Immunol,"Wang B, et al.

The existence of multiple Salmonella and Shigella serotypes as well as the emergence of strains resistant to antibiotics requires the development of broadly protective therapies. Recently, the needle tip proteins of the type III secretion system of these bacteria were successfully utilized (SipD for Salmonella and IpaD for Shigella) as vaccine immunogens to provide good prophylactic cross-protection in murine models of infections. From these experiments, we have isolated a cross-protective monoclonal antibody directed against a conserved region of both proteins. Its conformational epitope determined by Deep Mutational Scanning is conserved among needle tip proteins of all pathogenic Shigella species and Salmonella serovars, and are well recognized by this antibody. Our study provides the first in vivo experimental evidence of the importance of this common region in the mechanism of virulence of Salmonella and Shigella and opens the way to the development of cross-protective therapeutic agents.","['Sierocki R', 'Jneid B', 'Orsini Delgado ML', 'Plaisance M', 'Maillère B', 'Nozach H', 'Simon S']",2021,15,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Sierocki R, et al.

Within the study period, biological confirmation was available in less than 1% of cases. A dozen dysentery outbreaks were confirmed in laboratories as shigellosis. In this study, our objective is to improve dysentery surveillance.
METHODS: A descriptive method based on epidemiological and biological data was applied, and a literature review was included.
RESULTS: According to historical research, the first dysentery epidemics occurred in the Mayombe Region in the early 1920s. Spatial dynamics show that the eastern part of the country experienced the highest number of attacks. Time series of bloody diarrhea in the country have revealed a decrease since 2005. No seasonality was found.
CONCLUSION: Shigellosis outbreaks have become rare and of low magnitude. Our results suggest a need for further exploration of the causes and determinants of high incidences of bloody diarrhea.

In this article, we review what is known about the burden of ""other STIs"" in the United States, including those where sexual transmission is not the primary transmission route of infection. Although the combined burden of these other STIs may be substantial, accurately estimating their burden due to sexual transmission is difficult due to diagnostic and surveillance challenges.

33485326,"Multiple drug resistance of Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella isolated from diarrhoeic children at Kapsabet County referral hospital, Kenya.","BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea is a common cause of mortality and morbidity in children under five years old. In Kenya, it has a 21% case fatality with Enteropathogenic E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. accounting for 50-60% of the cases. Sulphonamides, tetracycline, ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are typically used in the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases but have become ineffective in the face of emerging antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella species in children under five years of age presenting with diarrhoea at Kapsabet County Referral Hospital in Kenya.
METHODS: Faecal samples were collected from 139 children admitted with diarrhoea. Each sample was examined macroscopically for colour, texture, and presence of extraneous material. The samples were then cultured for bacterial growth. Observed bacterial growth was isolated and identified by a series of biochemical tests. Resistance patterns were also evaluated using the Kirby - Bauer Disk diffusion method. The chi - square test and Pearson Correlation Coefficient were used to establish statistical significance.
RESULTS: Approximately 33.1% of the total faecal samples tested were positive for enteric pathogens. Shigella spp. demonstrated resistance to erythromycin (91.7%), doxycyclin (83.3%), ampicillin (82.1%), cotrimoxazole (73.1%), minocycline (66.7%) and cefuroxime (54.2%). Campylobacter jejuni also exhibited resistance to erythromycin (87.5%), doxycyclin (75%), ampicillin (73.7%), cotrimoxazole (73.3%) and minocycline (68.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: The resistance patterns of Shigella spp. and Campylobacter jejuni reported in this study necessitates the need for a comprehensive multiregional investigation to evaluate the geographical prevalence and antimicrobial resistance distributions of these microorganisms. These findings also support the need for the discovery and development of effective therapeutic alternatives.

33452891,Identification and evaluation of novel vaccine candidates against Shigella flexneri through reverse vaccinology approach.,"Shigellosis is a significant type of diarrhea that causes 160,000 deaths annually in a global scale. The mortality occurs mainly in children less than 5 years of age. No licensed vaccine is available, and conventional efforts for developing an effective and safe vaccine against shigellosis have not been succeeded yet. The reverse vaccinology is a novel promising method that screens genome or proteome of an organism for finding new vaccine candidates. In this study, through reverse vaccinology approach, new vaccine candidates against Shigella flexneri were identified and experimentally evaluated. Proteomes of S. flexneri were obtained from UniProt, and then outer membrane and extracellular proteins were predicted and selected for the evaluation of transmembrane domains, protein conservation, host homology, antigenicity, and solubility. From 103 proteins, 7 high-scored proteins were introduced as novel vaccine candidates, and after B- and T-cell epitope prediction, the best protein was selected for experimental studies. Recombinant protein was expressed, purified, and injected to BALB/c mice. The adhesion inhibitory effect of sera was also studied. The immunized mice demonstrated full protection against the lethal dose challenge. The sera remarkably inhibited S. flexneri adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells. The results indicate that identified antigen can serve for vaccine development against shigellosis and support reverse vaccinology for discovering novel effective antigens. KEY POINTS: • Seven Shigella new antigens were identified by reverse vaccinology (RV) approach. • The best antigen experimented demonstrated full protection against lethal dose. • In vivo results verified RV analyses and suggest FimG as a new potent vaccine candidate.","['Hajialibeigi A', 'Amani J', 'Gargari SLM']",2021,105,3,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,"Hajialibeigi A, et al.

33441861,Dissecting the contribution of O-Antigen and proteins to the immunogenicity of Shigella sonnei generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA).,"GMMA are exosomes released from engineered Gram-negative bacteria resembling the composition of outer membranes. We applied the GMMA technology for the development of an O-Antigen (OAg) based vaccine against Shigella sonnei, the most epidemiologically relevant cause of shigellosis. S. sonnei OAg has been identified as a key antigen for protective immunity, and GMMA are able to induce anti-OAg-specific IgG response in animal models and healthy adults. The contribution of protein-specific antibodies induced upon vaccination with GMMA has never been fully elucidated. Anti-protein antibodies are induced in mice upon immunization with either OAg-negative and OAg-positive GMMA. Here we demonstrated that OAg chains shield the bacteria from anti-protein antibody binding and therefore anti-OAg antibodies were the main drivers of bactericidal activity against OAg-positive bacteria. Interestingly, antibodies that are not targeting the OAg are functional against OAg-negative bacteria. The immunodominant protein antigens were identified by proteomic analysis. Our study confirms a critical role of the OAg on the immune response induced by S. sonnei GMMA. However, little is known about OAg length and density regulation during infection and, therefore, protein exposure. Hence, the presence of protein antigens on S. sonnei GMMA represents an added value for GMMA vaccines compared to other OAg-based formulations.","['Mancini F', 'Gasperini G', 'Rossi O', 'Aruta MG', 'Raso MM', 'Alfini R', 'Biagini M', 'Necchi F', 'Micoli F']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Mancini F, et al.

33396622,"Effects of El Niño/La Niña on the Number of Imported Shigellosis Cases in the Republic of Korea, 2004-2017.","Shigellosis is a major diarrheal disease in low- and middle-income countries. Although the incidence of such diseases in South and Southeast Asia has been associated with climate fluctuations linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the impact of ENSO on shigellosis infections remains unknown. Data reported to being infected with shigellosis while traveling abroad from 2004 to 2017 were obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We investigated the relationship between the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) and Indian Ocean Dipole Mode Index and the relative risk of shigellosis in outbound travelers using distributed lag linear and non-linear models. From 2004 to 2017, 87.1% of imported shigellosis was infected in South and Southeast Asian countries. The relative risk of imported shigellosis infection in outbound travelers increased as the ONI decreased. In the association with the five-month cumulative ONI, the relative risk of infection continuously increased as the La Niña index gained strength. Climate fluctuations associated with the La Niña phenomenon in South and Southeast Asian countries can lead to issues in sanitation and water safety. Our findings suggest that the decreasing trend in the ONI is associated with an increased incidence of shigellosis in these countries.","['Kim JH', 'Sung J', 'Kwon HJ', 'Cheong HK']",2020,18,1,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Kim JH, et al.

33385650,The direct and interactive impacts of hydrological factors on bacillary dysentery across different geographical regions in central China.,"Previous studies found non-linear mutual interactions among hydrometeorological factors on diarrheal disease. However, the complex interactions of the hydrometeorological, topographical and human activity factors need to be further explored. This study aimed to reveal how hydrological and other factors jointly influence bacillary dysentery in different geographical regions. Using Anhui Province in China, consisted of Huaibei plain, Jianghuai hilly and Wannan mountainous regions, we integrated multi-source data (6 meteorological, 3 hydrological, 2 topographic, and 9 socioeconomic variables) to explore the direct and interactive relationship between hydrological factors (quick flow, baseflow and local recharge) and other factors by combining the ecosystem model InVEST with spatial statistical analysis. The results showed hydrological factors had significant impact powers (q = 0.444 (Huaibei plain) for local recharge, 0.412 (Jianghuai hilly region) and 0.891 (Wannan mountainous region) for quick flow, respectively) on bacillary dysentery in different regions, but lost powers at provincial level. Land use and soil properties have created significant interactions with hydrological factors across Anhui province. Particularly, percentage of farmland in Anhui province can influence quick flow across Jianghuai, Wannan regions and the whole province, and it also has significant interactions with the baseflow and local recharge across the plain as well as the whole province. Percentage of urban areas had interactions with baseflow and local recharge in Jianghuai and Wannan regions. Additionally, baseflow and local recharge could be interacted with meteorological factors (e.g. temperature and wind speed), while these interactions varied in different regions. In conclusion, it was evident that hydrological factors had significant impacts on bacillary dysentery, and also interacted significantly with meteorological and socioeconomic factors. This study applying ecosystem model and spatial analysis help reveal the complex and nonlinear transmission of bacillary dysentery in different geographical regions, supporting the development of precise public health interventions with consideration of hydrological factors.","['Zuo S', 'Yang L', 'Dou P', 'Ho HC', 'Dai S', 'Ma W', 'Ren Y', 'Huang C']",2021,764,,Sci Total Environ,"Zuo S, et al.

33360132,Real-time forecasting and early warning of bacillary dysentery activity in four meteorological and geographic divisions in China.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate and timely forecasts of bacillary dysentery (BD) incidence can be used to inform public health decision-making and response preparedness. However, our ability to detect BD dynamics and outbreaks remains limited in China.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the impacts of meteorological factors on BD transmission in four representative regions in China and to forecast weekly number of BD cases and outbreaks.
METHODS: Weekly BD and meteorological data from 2014 to 2016 were collected for Beijing (Northern China), Shenyang (Northeast China), Chongqing (Southwest China) and Shenzhen (Southern China). A boosted regression tree (BRT) model was conducted to assess the impacts of meteorological factors on BD transmission. Then a real-time forecast and early warning model based on BRT was developed to track the dynamics of BD and detect the outbreaks. The forecasting methodology was compared with generalized additive model (GAM) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA) that have been used to model the BD case data previously.
RESULTS: Ambient temperature was the most important meteorological factor contributing to the transmission of BD (80.81%-92.60%). A positive effect of temperature was observed when weekly mean temperature exceeded 4 °C, -3 °C, 9 °C and 16 °C in Beijing (Northern China), Shenyang (Northeast China), Chongqing (Southwest China) and Shenzhen (Southern China), respectively. BD incidence (Beijing and Shenyang) in temperate cities was more sensitive to high temperature than that in subtropical cities (Chongqing and Shenzhen). The dynamics and outbreaks of BD can be accurately forecasted and detected by the BRT model. Compared to GAM and SARIMA, BRT model showed more accurate forecasting for 1-, 2-, 3-weeks ahead forecasts in Beijing, Shenyang and Shenzhen.
CONCLUSIONS: Temperature plays the most important role in weather-attributable BD transmission. The BRT model achieved a better performance in comparison with GAM and SARIMA in most study cities, which could be used as a more accurate tool for forecasting and outbreak alert of BD in China.","['Wang S', 'Liu Z', 'Tong M', 'Xiang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu L', 'Jiang B', 'Bi P']",2021,761,,Sci Total Environ,"Wang S, et al.

Shigellosis is one of the substantial causative agents of microbial dysentery and still has a remarkable prevalence, particularly in areas with poor hygienic infrastructures. The probable existence of the deadly Shiga toxin (Stx) protein in some Shigella strains would manifest life-threatening clinical symptoms of the infection.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine the presence of Shigella toxin 1 (Stx1) in isolated from patients with diarrhea. Totally, 227 Shigella species, including 60 S. flexneri, 157 S. sonnei, and 10 S. boydii were collected from diarrheal patients in the tropical infectious diseases research center of Ahvaz, Iran, during 2013-2015. The isolates were collected mostly from the intensive care unit, infectious disease, and surgery settings. The isolates were identified, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the stx gene.
RESULTS: The results indicated that none of them encode the stx1 gene.
CONCLUSION: Isolates of this study were not capable of stx1 encoding.

At the moment, there are no reports showing the epidemiological status of this region that would allow to establish methods for prevention and control of these infections and to indicate of the prevalent pathogen that produces them. Therefore we carried out an epidemiological study of the gastroenteritis etiological agents and their incidence in the pediatric population. A total of 17 823 fecal samples were collected, 14 242 from HNJ-Tuc, 2,257 from CePSI-Stgo and 1,324 from HINEP-Cat. In 2,595 samples a bacterial agent was identified, the 93.64% corresponded to Shigella/Salmonella clinical isolates. Shigella genus was the prevalent pathogen, being Shigella flexneri 2 the most frequent serotype. Most of the Shigella clinical isolates presented themselves as multidrug-resistant (MDR), harboring 2 to 3 genetic resistance determinants. 50% of the affected patients were children under 4 years old. Here, we demonstrate that bacterial gastrointestinal diseases strongly affect the health of NWA population. The appearance of epidemic outbreaks, as happened during 2014, suggest that they may be related to the socio-economic poverty of NWA.

Microbiologic and clinical case definitions are needed for pediatric field vaccine efficacy trials.
METHODS: We compared characteristics of moderate to severe diarrhea (MSD) cases in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) between children with culture positive Shigella to those with culture-negative, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-attributable Shigella (defined by an ipaH gene cycle threshold <27.9). Among Shigella MSD cases, we determined risk factors for death and derived a clinical severity score.
RESULTS: Compared to culture-positive Shigella MSD cases (n = 745), culture-negative/qPCR-attributable Shigella cases (n = 852) were more likely to be under 12 months, stunted, have a longer duration of diarrhea, and less likely to have high stool frequency or a fever. There was no difference in dehydration, hospitalization, or severe classification from a modified Vesikari score. Twenty-two (1.8%) Shigella MSD cases died within the 14-days after presentation to health facilities, and 59.1% of these deaths were in culture-negative cases. Age <12 months, diarrhea duration prior to presentation, vomiting, stunting, wasting, and hospitalization were associated with mortality. A model-derived score assigned points for dehydration, hospital admission, and longer diarrhea duration but was not significantly better at predicting 14-day mortality than a modified Vesikari score.
CONCLUSIONS: A composite severity score consistent with severe disease or dysentery may be a pragmatic clinical endpoint for severe shigellosis in vaccine trials. Reliance on culture for microbiologic confirmation may miss a substantial number of Shigella cases but is currently required to measure serotype specific immunity.","['Pavlinac PB', 'Platts-Mills JA', 'Tickell KD', 'Liu J', 'Juma J', 'Kabir F', 'Nkeze J', 'Okoi C', 'Operario DJ', 'Uddin J', 'Ahmed S', 'Alonso PL', 'Antonio M', 'Becker SM', 'Breiman RF', 'Faruque ASG', 'Fields B', 'Gratz J', 'Haque R', 'Hossain A', 'Hossain MJ', 'Jarju S', 'Qamar F', 'Iqbal NT', 'Kwambana B', 'Mandomando I', 'McMurry TL', 'Ochieng C', 'Ochieng JB', 'Ochieng M', 'Onyango C', 'Panchalingam S', 'Kalam A', 'Aziz F', 'Qureshi S', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Roberts JH', 'Saha D', 'Sow SO', 'Stroup SE', 'Sur D', 'Tamboura B', 'Taniuchi M', 'Tennant SM', 'Roose A', 'Toema D', 'Wu Y', 'Zaidi A', 'Nataro JP', 'Levine MM', 'Houpt ER', 'Kotloff KL']",2021,73,3,Clin Infect Dis,"Pavlinac PB, et al.

33039932,Spatiotemporal variations in the incidence of bacillary dysentery and long-term effects associated with meteorological and socioeconomic factors in China from 2013 to 2017.,"Bacillary dysentery is a global public health problem that exhibits manifest spatiotemporal heterogeneity. However, long-term variations and regional determinant factors remain unclear. In this study, the Bayesian space-time hierarchy model was used to identify the long-term spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the incidence of bacillary dysentery and quantify the associations of meteorological factors with the incidence of bacillary dysentery in northern and southern China from 2013 to 2017. GeoDetector was used to quantify the determinant powers of socioeconomic factors in the two regions. The results showed that the incidence of bacillary dysentery peaked in summer (June to August), indicating temporal seasonality. Geographically, the hot spots (high-risk areas) were distributed in northwestern China (Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia) and northern China (including Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei), whereas the cold spots (low-risk areas) were concentrated in southeastern China (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong). Moreover, significant regional differences were found among the meteorological and socioeconomic factors. Average temperature was the dominant meteorological factor in both northern and southern China. In northern and southern China, a 1 °C increase in the average temperature led to an increase of 1.01% and 4.26% in bacillary dysentery risk, respectively. The dominant socioeconomic factors in northern and southern China were per capita gross domestic product and the number of health technicians, with q statistic values of 0.81 and 0.49, respectively. These findings suggest that hot, moist, and overcrowded environments or poor health conditions increase the risk of bacillary dysentery.

33021590,Association of Serotype With Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns Among Shigella flexneri Isolates From Pakistan: The Importance of Serotype 2b.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella flexneri is an emerging threat in low socioeconomic countries including Pakistan. No previous data is available on the association between S. flexneri serotypes and antimicrobial resistance in Pakistan.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to assess the association between serotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns among S. flexneri isolated from clinical and nonclinical samples.
METHODS: A total of 199 S. flexneri isolates were subjected to molecular serotyping and antibiotic resistance.
RESULTS: The most prevalent S. flexneri serotype was 2b (38%) followed by 1b (24%), 7a (20%), 2a (11%), 1d (5%) and Y (2%). The phylogenetic reconstruction showed 12 clades among which the clades II, III, V, VIII, IX and XI have consisted of serotypes that were found both in human population and environment samples. A high level of multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in serotype 2b (37.68%) followed by 1b (19.5%) and 7a (19.5%), 2a (11.5%), 1d (5%) and Y (2%). All isolates of serotype 2b showed high level of resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (100%) followed by quinolone (74.6%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (54.6%). Interestingly, none of the serotype was resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem and amikacin. The most frequently detected resistance genes among serotype 2b were blaOXA (100%) followed by qnrS (88%), cat (81%) and sul2 (63%).
CONCLUSION: The most frequent S. flexneri serotype was 2b while 1d and Y was first time reported in Pakistan. High frequency of MDR serotypes of S. flexneri is a serious threat in diarrhea endemic regions and thus require urgent strategies for its continuous monitoring and prevention.","['Nisa I', 'Haroon M', 'Qasim M', 'Driessen A', 'Nijland J', 'Yasin N', 'Jalal A', 'Ali N', 'Ullah W', 'Khan TA', 'Begum A', 'Rahman H']",2020,39,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Nisa I, et al.

32929595,Shigella sonnei: virulence and antibiotic resistance.,"Shigella sonnei is the emerging pathogen globally, as it is the second common infectious species of shigellosis (bloody diarrhoea) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and the leading one in developed world. The multifactorial processes and novel mechanisms have been identified in S. sonnei, that are collectively playing apart a substantial role in increasing its prevalence, while replacing the S. flexneri and other Gram-negative gut pathogens niche occupancy. Recently, studies suggest that due to improvement in sanitation S. sonnei has reduced cross-immunization from Plesiomonas shigelliodes (having same O-antigen as S. sonnei) and also found to outcompete the two major species of Enterobacteriaceae family (Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli), due to encoding of type VI secretion system (T6SS). This review aimed to highlight S. sonnei as an emerging pathogen in the light of recent research with pondering aspects on its epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenic mechanisms. Additionally, this paper aimed to review S. sonnei disease pattern and related complications, symptoms, and laboratory diagnostic techniques. Furthermore, the available treatment reigns and antibiotic-resistance patterns of S. sonnei are also discussed, as the ciprofloxacin and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. sonnei has already intensified the global spread and burden of antimicrobial resistance. In last, prevention and controlling strategies are briefed to limit and tackle S. sonnei and possible future areas are also explored that needed more research to unravel the hidden mysteries surrounding S. sonnei.","['Shad AA', 'Shad WA']",2021,203,1,Arch Microbiol,Shad AA and Shad WA.

32911076,Differential expression of cytokine genes in THP-1-derived macrophages infected with mild and virulence strains of Shigella flexneri 2a.,"Shigella is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes bacterial dysentery called shigellosis. The assessment of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators produced by immune cells against this bacteria are vital in identifying the effectiveness of the immune reaction in protecting the host. In Malaysia, Shigella is ranked as the third most common bacteria causing diarrheal disease among children below 5 years old. In the present study, we aim to examine the differential cytokine gene expressions of macrophages in response to two types of clinical strains of Shigella flexneri 2a (S. flexneri 2a) isolated from patients admitted in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia. THP-1-derived macrophages, as the model of human macrophages, were infected separately with S. flexneri 2a mild (SH062) and virulence (SH057) strains for 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. The gene expression level of inflammatory mediators was identified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The production of nitric oxide (NO) by the macrophages was measured by using a commercialized NO assay kit. The ability of macrophages to kill the intracellular bacteria was assessed by intracellular killing assay. Induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and NO, confirmed the pro-inflammatory reaction of the THP-1-derived macrophages in response to S. flexneri 2a, especially against the SH507 strain. The SH057 also induced a marked increase in the expression levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs at 12 h and 24 h post-infection. In the intracellular killing assay, both strains showed less viable, indicating the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the presence of iNOS and NO was crucial in the stimulation of macrophages for the host defense against shigellosis. Transcription analysis of THP-1-derived macrophages in this study identifies differentially expressed cytokine genes that correlated with the virulence factor of S. flexneri 2a.","['Shabani NRM', 'Mokhtar M', 'Leow CH', 'Lean QY', 'Chuah C', 'Singh KKB', 'Leow CY']",2020,85,,Infect Genet Evol,"Shabani NRM, et al.

32908585,Optimal Control of Shigellosis with Cost-Effective Strategies.,"In this paper, we apply optimal control theory to the model for shigellosis. It is assumed that education campaign, sanitation, and treatment are the main controls for this disease. The aim is to minimize the number of infections resulting from contact with careers, infectious population, and contaminated environments while keeping the cost of associated controls minimum. We achieve this aim through the application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Numerical simulations are carried out by using both forward and backward in time fourth-order Runge-Kutta schemes. We simulate the model under different strategies to investigate which option could yield the best results. The findings show that the strategy combining all three control efforts (treatment, sanitation, and education campaign) proves to be more beneficial in containing shigellosis than the rest. On the other hand, cost-effectiveness analysis is performed via incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The findings from the ICER show that a strategy incorporating all three controls (treatment, sanitation, and education campaign) is the most cost-effective of all strategies considered in the study.","['Edward S', 'Shaban N', 'Mureithi E']",2020,2020,,Comput Math Methods Med,"Edward S, et al.

32897426,Identification of the natural product berberine as an antiviral drug.,"Drugs targeting the fusion process of viral entry into host cells have been approved for clinical use in the treatment of AIDS. There remains a great need to improve the use of existing drugs for HIV therapy. Berberine is traditionally used to treat diarrhea, bacillary dysentery, and gastroenteritis in clinics, here our research shows that berberine is effective in inhibiting HIV-1 entry. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies reveal that berberine can directly bind to both N36 and C34 to form a novel N36-berberine-C34 complex and effectively block the six-helix bundle formation between the N-terminal heptad repeat peptide N36 and the C-terminal heptad repeat peptide C34. Circular dichroism experiments show that binding of berberine produces conformational changes that damages the secondary structures of 6-HB. Computer-aided molecular docking studies suggest a hydrogen bond with T-639 and two polar bonds with Q-563 and T-639 are established, involving the oxygen atom and the C=O group of the indole ring. Berberine completely inhibits six HIV-1 clade B isolates and exhibits antiviral activities in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values varying from 5.5 to 10.25 µg/ml. This compound-peptide interaction may represent a mechanism of action of antiviral activities of berberine. As a summary, these studies successfully identify compound berberine as a potential candidate drug for HIV-1 treatment. As a summary, antiviral activity of berberine in combination with its use in clinical practice, this medicine can be used as a potential clinically anti-HIV drug.","['Shao J', 'Zeng D', 'Tian S', 'Liu G', 'Fu J']",2020,10,1,AMB Express,"Shao J, et al.

Phylogenomic analysis clustered antibiotic-sensitive and resistant S. sonnei into two distinct groups while pan-genome analysis reveals the presence and absence of unique genes in each group. Screening of 31 classes of virulence factors found out that type 2 secretion system is doubled in resistant strains. Further principle component analysis based on the interactions between virulence and resistance indicated that abundant virulence factors are associated with higher levels of antibiotic resistance. The result present here is based on statistical analysis of a small sample size and serves basically as a guidance for further experimental and theoretical studies.","['Zhu Z', 'Wang L', 'Qian H', 'Gu F', 'Li Y', 'Zhang H', 'Chen Y', 'Shi J', 'Ma P', 'Bao C', 'Gu B']",2021,24,1,Int Microbiol,"Zhu Z, et al.

In this issue, Ashida et al (2020) have elucidated the role of two such factors from Shigella flexneri-OspC1 and OspD3-that together counteract apoptotic and necroptotic death pathways in colonised epithelial cells. As a result, Shigella can replicate to high levels within the colonic epithelium, leading to the substantial epithelial damage in shigellosis and efficient bacterial release for faecal transmission.","['Thygesen SJ', 'Pliego-Zamora A', 'Stacey KJ']",2020,39,17,EMBO J,"Thygesen SJ, et al.

32866204,Shigella hijacks the exocyst to cluster macropinosomes for efficient vacuolar escape.,"Shigella flexneri invades host cells by entering within a bacteria-containing vacuole (BCV). In order to establish its niche in the host cytosol, the bacterium ruptures its BCV. Contacts between S. flexneri BCV and infection-associated macropinosomes (IAMs) formed in situ have been reported to enhance BCV disintegration. The mechanism underlying S. flexneri vacuolar escape remains however obscure. To decipher the molecular mechanism priming the communication between the IAMs and S. flexneri BCV, we performed mass spectrometry-based analysis of the magnetically purified IAMs from S. flexneri-infected cells. While proteins involved in host recycling and exocytic pathways were significantly enriched at the IAMs, we demonstrate more precisely that the S. flexneri type III effector protein IpgD mediates the recruitment of the exocyst to the IAMs through the Rab8/Rab11 pathway. This recruitment results in IAM clustering around S. flexneri BCV. More importantly, we reveal that IAM clustering subsequently facilitates an IAM-mediated unwrapping of the ruptured vacuole membranes from S. flexneri, enabling the naked bacterium to be ready for intercellular spread via actin-based motility. Taken together, our work untangles the molecular cascade of S. flexneri-driven host trafficking subversion at IAMs to develop its cytosolic lifestyle, a crucial step en route for infection progression at cellular and tissue level.","['Chang YY', 'Stévenin V', 'Duchateau M', 'Giai Gianetto Q', 'Hourdel V', 'Rodrigues CD', 'Matondo M', 'Reiling N', 'Enninga J']",2020,16,8,PLoS Pathog,"Chang YY, et al.

32804926,Epidemiology of Shigella infections and diarrhea in the first two years of life using culture-independent diagnostics in 8 low-resource settings.,"Culture-independent diagnostics have revealed a larger burden of Shigella among children in low-resource settings than previously recognized. We further characterized the epidemiology of Shigella in the first two years of life in a multisite birth cohort. We tested 41,405 diarrheal and monthly non-diarrheal stools from 1,715 children for Shigella by quantitative PCR. To assess risk factors, clinical factors related to age and culture positivity, and associations with inflammatory biomarkers, we used log-binomial regression with generalized estimating equations. The prevalence of Shigella varied from 4.9%-17.8% in non-diarrheal stools across sites, and the incidence of Shigella-attributable diarrhea was 31.8 cases (95% CI: 29.6, 34.2) per 100 child-years. The sensitivity of culture compared to qPCR was 6.6% and increased to 27.8% in Shigella-attributable dysentery. Shigella diarrhea episodes were more likely to be severe and less likely to be culture positive in younger children. Older age (RR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.70, 1.81 per 6-month increase in age), unimproved sanitation (RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.29), low maternal education (<10 years, RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.26), initiating complementary foods before 3 months (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.20), and malnutrition (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.95 per unit increase in weight-for-age z-score) were risk factors for Shigella. There was a linear dose-response between Shigella quantity and myeloperoxidase concentrations.

32790793,Combining physicochemical properties and microbiome data to evaluate the water quality of South African drinking water production plants.,"Anthropogenic activities in catchments used for drinking water production largely contaminates source waters, and this may impact the quality of the final drinking water product. These contaminants may also affect taxonomic and functional profiles of the bacterial communities in the drinking water. Here, we report an integrated insight into the microbiome and water quality of four water treatment plants (NWC, NWE, WCA and NWG) that supply portable water to communities in South Africa. A new scoring system based on combined significant changes of physicochemical parameters and microbial abundance from raw to treated water was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment plants at water purification. Physicochemical parameters which include total soluble solids, turbidity, pH, nitrites and phosphorus among others, were measured in source, treated, and distributed water. There were general statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences between raw and treated water, demonstrating the effectiveness of the purification process. Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used for taxonomic profiling of the microbial communities and this data was used to infer functional attributes of the communities. Structure and composition of the bacterial communities differed significantly (P < 0.05) among the treatment plants, only NWE and NWG showed no significant differences (P > 0.05), this correlated with the predicted functional profile of the microbial communities obtained from Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Observed States (PICRUSt), as well as the likely pollutants of source water. Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi and Fibrobacteres significantly differed (P < 0.05) between raw and distributed water. PICRUSt inferred a number of pathways involved in the degradation of xenobiotics such as Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. More worryingly, was the presence of pathways involved in beta-lactam resistance, potential pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, Vibrio cholerae infection, and Shigellosis. Also present in drinking and treated water were OTUs associated with a number of opportunistic pathogens.","['Maguvu TE', 'Bezuidenhout CC', 'Kritzinger R', 'Tsholo K', 'Plaatjie M', 'Molale-Tom LG', 'Mienie CM', 'Coertze RD']",2020,15,8,PLoS One,"Maguvu TE, et al.

32788427,Factors Associated With Mortality in Toxic Encephalopathy Due to Shigellosis in Children.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics and factors associated with mortality among children with Shigella encephalopathy.
METHODS: The data collection was done prospectively from January, 2018 to May, 2019 with retrospective data from June, 2016 to December, 2017. The study cohort consisted of 58 children <12 years of age with Shigella encephalopathy admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Shigella encephalopathy was confirmed if culture or real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a stool sample or rectal swab was positive, with temporal association of diarrhea with seizures, altered sensorium or both. Association of mortality with risk factors was tested using chi square test, and the strength of association was estimated in terms of relative risk (RR) and 95% CI.
RESULTS: Seizures and altered sensorium were the predominant neurological symptoms. Shock occurred in 32 (55%) children, while blood in stools was a feature in only 6 (10%) children. S. sonnei was the commonest species identified on stool culture (19;33%). On univariate analysis, prolonged seizures, shock, prolonged altered sensorium, multi-organ dysfunction, lymphocytopenia at admission and need for mechanical ventilation were significantly associated with mortality. On multivariate regression, delayed presentation (presentation to the hospital 48 hours after the onset of symptoms) and prolonged altered sensorium (>12 hours) were found to be independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Recognition of factors associated with mortality in Shigella encephalopathy may assist in better monitoring of sicker children and improved outcomes.","['Jayakrishnan MP', 'Geeta MG', 'Krishnakumar P', 'Gireeshan VK', 'George B', 'Prathiksha P', 'Arunkumar G', 'Anitha PM']",2020,57,11,Indian Pediatr,"Jayakrishnan MP, et al.

32727466,Case report on a swift shift in uropathogens from Shigella flexneri to Escherichia coli: a thin line between bacterial persistence and reinfection.,"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are mostly caused by bacteria. Urine cultures are usually a definitive measure to select the appropriate antibiotics for the elimination of a uropathogen and subsequent recovery from the infection. However, the preferred antibiotics as determined by urine culture and sensitivity may still not eliminate the infection and would require further examination to ascertain the cause of treatment failure which could be unresolved bacteriuria, bacterial persistence, immediate reinfection with a different uropathogen or misdiagnosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-years 7 months-old female was admitted in the Regional hospital of Buea following persistent fever. An auto medication with amoxicillin was reported. Urinalysis was done on the first day and the sediment of the cloudy urine revealed many bacteria and few pus cells. Ceftriaxone was prescribed as empirical treatment and a request for urine and blood culture was made. Three days after admission, the temperature and CRP were 39.0 °C and 96 mg/l, respectively. The urine culture results (> 10
CONCLUSION: Antibiotics tailored towards the elimination of a particular bacterial species may as well provide a favorable environment for other bacterial species that are resistant to it in the course of treating a UTI episode. This apparent treatment failure may first of all require a second urine culture for confirmation rather than considering the possibilities of a misdiagnosis.","['Tufon KA', 'Fokam DPY', 'Kouanou YS', 'Meriki HD']",2020,19,1,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,"Tufon KA, et al.

32719207,Generating mucosal and systemic immune response following vaccination of vibrio cholerae adhesion molecule against shigella flexneri infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown 37.8 kDa pili subunit protein of Vibrio cholerae and 49.8 kDa pili subunit protein of Shigella flexneri can act as an adhesion molecule to initiate infection. These molecules also have the ability to agglutinate blood. The present study assessed mucosal and systemic immunity following vaccination using 37.8 kDa V. cholerae and protection against S. flexneri.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Haemagglutination test was performed after purification of V. cholerae protein, followed by an anti-haemagglutination test. The intestinal weight and colony count were used to validate the protective effect on balb/c mice which were divided into the naive group, Shigella-positive control group, Vibrio-positive control group, V. cholerae infected-Vibrio-vaccinated group and S. flexneri-infected-Vibrio-vaccinated group. Th17, Treg, interleukin (IL) IL-17A, β-defensin and secretory-immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) were also measured to determine the systemic and mucosal immunity after vaccination.
RESULTS: The haemagglutination and anti-haemagglutination tests showed that the 37.8 kDa protein could inhibit 49.8 kDa of the S. flexneri pili subunit. Decreased intestinal weight and colony count of vaccinated group compared to naive group also support cross reaction findings. Vaccination also generates higher level of Th17, Treg, IL-17A, β-defensin and s-IgA significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: 37.8 kDa subunit pili can act as a homologous vaccine candidate to prevent V. cholerae and S. flexneri infection.","['Prawiro SR', 'Poeranto S', 'Amalia A', 'Widyani EL', 'Indraswari G', 'Soraya M', 'Dwi Pradipto SR', 'Prasetya A', 'Hidayat GR', 'Alitha Putri SN']",2020,38,1,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Prawiro SR, et al.

32710175,A high number of multidrug-resistant and predominant genetically related cluster of Shigella flexneri strains isolated over 34 years in Brazil.,"Shigella flexneri has been a major public health problem in developing countries. This work analyzed the frequency of 16 virulence genes, the genotypic diversity, and the antimicrobial resistance profiles of 130 S. flexneri strains isolated in Brazil. The ipaH gene was found in all the 130 strains. The frequencies of the other genes were variable ial (88.5%), sigA (82.3%), iuc (74.6%), virA (73%), pic (72.3%), virF (57.7%), sat (48.5%), ipaBCD (37%), sen (36%), set1A (35.4%), sepA (30%), set1B (30%), virB (14%), icsA (10%), and ipgD (5.4%). A total of 57 (43.8%) strains were multidrug-resistant. ERIC-PCR grouped 96 of the strains into a single cluster with ≥ 70.4% of similarity, 75 of these strains presented a similarity ≥ 80.9%. PFGE grouped 120 of the strains into a single cluster with 57.4% of similarity and 82 of these strains presented a similarity ≥ 70.6%. In conclusion, the high frequency of some virulence genes reinforces the pathogenic potential of the strains studied. The high rates of MDR strains are alarming once it may lead to failure when antimicrobial treatment is necessary. Genotype techniques reveled a major cluster with high genetic similarity including S. flexneri strains from the different Brazilian states and distinct years of isolation, showing that they probably emerged from a common ancestor.","['Gonzales JC', 'Seribelli AA', 'Gomes CN', 'Dos Prazeres Rodrigues D', 'Campioni F', 'Passaglia J', 'da Silva P', 'Falcão JP']",2020,51,4,Braz J Microbiol,"Gonzales JC, et al.

32636430,MTFMT deficiency correlates with reduced mitochondrial integrity and enhanced host susceptibility to intracellular infection.,"Mitochondria behave as functional and structural hubs for innate defense against intracellular infection. While the mitochondrial membrane serves as a platform for the assembly of signaling complexes activated by intracellular infection, various danger molecules derived from impaired mitochondria activate innate signaling pathways. Using methionyl-tRNA formyl transferase (MTFMT)-deficient cells, which exhibit impaired mitochondrial activity, we examined the role of mitochondrial integrity in regulating innate defense against infection. Since MTFMT functions at the early steps of mitochondrial translation, its loss was expected to cause defects in mitochondrial activity. Under transient MTFMT gene silencing conditions, we observed shortened mitochondria along with reduced activity. MTFMT-silenced cells were more susceptible to intracellular infection, as examined by infection with RNA viruses and the intracellular bacterium Shigella flexneri. In support of this observation, MTFMT-silenced cells possessed lowered basal NF-κB activity, which remained low after S. flexneri infection. In addition, the mitochondrial accumulation of evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathway (ECSIT), an adaptor protein for NF-κB activation, was significantly decreased in MTFMT-silenced cells, explaining the reduced NF-κB activity observed in these cells. Since impaired mitochondria likely release mitochondrial molecules, we evaluated the contribution of mitochondrial N-formyl peptides to the regulation of bacterial infection. Transient transfection of mitochondrial-derived N-formyl peptides favored S. flexneri infection, which was accompanied by enhanced bacterial survival, but did not affect host cell viability. However, transient transfection of mitochondrial-derived N-formyl peptides did not affect basal NF-κB activity. Altogether, these data suggest that the integrity of mitochondria is essential to their proper function in protecting against infection, as intact mitochondria not only block the release of danger molecules but also serve as signaling hubs for the downstream NF-κB pathway.","['Seo JH', 'Hwang CS', 'Yoo JY']",2020,10,1,Sci Rep,"Seo JH, et al.

32624341,"A shigellosis outbreak associated with a sports festival at a kindergarten in Kitakyushu City, Japan.","INTRODUCTION: Shigellosis cases have decreased gradually in Japan in recent years, but indigenous shigellosis outbreaks sometimes occur in childcare facilities. From national surveillance data, we identified a shigellosis outbreak involving a kindergarten.
METHODS: After detecting Shigella sonnei in Kitakyushu City, we conducted active case finding and epidemiological investigation in Kindergarten Z, including stool specimen collection and interviews. The stool specimens were cultured, and isolated strains were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA).
RESULTS: Between September 1 and December 31, 2014, we identified 19 cases: 14 confirmed, 2 suspected, and 3 asymptomatic. Of the 19 cases, 16 were epidemiologically associated with Kindergarten Z (10 pupils, 5 family members, and 1 teacher). On October 19, a pupil with gastrointestinal illness participated in the kindergarten's sports festival, in which the pupils were split into ""red"" and ""white"" teams; the pupil in question belonged to the red team. Attack rates of the red and white teams were 8% (7/82) and 0% (0/108), respectively (relative risk, 10.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-82.1). PFGE patterns were identical or similar for the isolates in all 17 cases; 7 isolates were identical, and the others had one locus difference on MLVA.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that contact during the sports festival could have been responsible for spread of the shigellosis outbreak at the kindergarten, although the infection source was not determined. It is vital to inform guardians immediately after detection of shigellosis cases that symptomatic pupils should not participate in activities such as sports festivals.","['Kato H', 'Yahata Y', 'Hori Y', 'Fujita K', 'Ooura N', 'Kido T', 'Yoshimoto K', 'Matsui T', 'Izumiya H', 'Ohnishi M', 'Oishi K']",2020,26,11,J Infect Chemother,"Kato H, et al.

32569257,"Shigellosis Among Gay and Bisexual Men: A Qualitative Assessment to Examine Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices.","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is a highly contagious enteric bacterial disease transmitted through the fecal-oral route. It is primarily transmitted through person-to-person contact and via contaminated food and water. Outbreaks of shigellosis among men who have sex with men (MSM) attributed to sexual person-to-person contact have been reported. These outbreaks are of concern because they are often caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Shigella. Little is known about shigellosis-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices among gay, bisexual, and other MSM.
METHODS: Six focus groups were conducted among self-identified gay or bisexual men in Atlanta, GA, in Fall 2017. Participants were asked about shigellosis-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Focus groups were audio recorded, and the transcribed audio was analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic coding.
RESULTS: Among the 24 focus group participants, most perceived that diarrheal illness was caused by contaminated food. Knowledge of shigellosis and Shigella was low, with most never having heard of the disease or bacteria. Participants did not perceive shigellosis to be a serious health concern, especially when compared with HIV; however, they did perceive gay and bisexual men to be at risk of Shigella infection. Participants reported mixed intentions to change sexual behaviors to prevent shigellosis or talk with sexual partners about diarrhea.
CONCLUSIONS: Health communication and education efforts could be used to increase knowledge about shigellosis and shift perceptions about the severity of shigellosis among gay, bisexual, and other MSM. Additional work is needed to identify effective ways to promote shigellosis-related prevention behaviors among gay, bisexual, and other MSM.","['Caruso E', 'Wright ER', 'Respress ET', 'Evener SL', 'Jacobson K', 'Bowen A', 'Kachur R', 'Garcia-Williams A']",2020,47,9,Sex Transm Dis,"Caruso E, et al.

This study investigated the prevalence of EHI, its temporal trends, and associated factors among newly diagnosed PLWH in Taiwan. Medical records of newly diagnosed PLWH at six medical centers in Taiwan between 2009 and 2018 were reviewed. The annual prevalence of invasive amoebiasis and seroprevalence of E. histolytica were determined and examined by the Cochran-Armitage test. The clinical characteristics associated with invasive amoebiasis and seropositivity for E. histolytica were analyzed in multivariable regression models. Among 5362 patients seeking HIV care at six medical centers in Taiwan during the 10-year study period, 119 (2.2%) had invasive amoebiasis at the time or within six months of their HIV diagnosis. Among 3499 who had indirect hemagglutination antibody (IHA) determined, 284 (8.1%) had positive IHA (≥1:32) and 205 (5.9%) had high-titre IHA (≥1:128). The prevalence of invasive amoebiasis increased from 1.3% in 2012 to 3.3% in 2018 (p = 0.024). Invasive amoebiasis was independently associated with a greater age, men who have sex with men, rapid plasma reagin titre ≥1:4, and concurrent shigellosis and giardiasis. Increasing prevalence of invasive amoebiasis among newly diagnosed PLWH in Taiwan calls for strategies to prevent ongoing transmission in this population.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest among all cancers. The role of bacteria as an anticancer agent dates back to almost 100 years ago. The microbiome has recently become a focus of research in carcinogenesis and even pancreatic cancer. Shigella flexneri is a gram-negative bacterium, which causes shigellosis with symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps in human. Shigella flexneri may play a very important role in the internal pathways of apoptosis and may induce apoptosis in some of the cancerous cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this experiment bacteria were cultured on Salmonella-Shigella agar, then inoculated into BHI Broth medium. After sonication, the protein concentration of the bacterium was measured by using the ZellBio Sensitive Protein Bradford Assay kit. MTT assay was performed to obtain IC
RESULTS: The results showed that Shigella flexneri has the potential anti-proliferative effect in pancreatic cancer. The inhibitory concentration, pro-apoptotic amount to upregulate Bax, and meanwhile also to downregulate the bcl-2 found to be 10 μl.
CONCLUSION: In general, due to defects in the apoptotic pathway in cancer cells and the existence of drug-resistant cells, the detection of new apoptotic inducers such as Shigella flexneri cell extract can be used for further studies on cancer therapy.","['Khodavirdipour A', 'Jamshidi F', 'Nejad HR', 'Zandi M', 'Zarean R']",2021,52,2,J Gastrointest Cancer,"Khodavirdipour A, et al.

32512665,"Major enteropathogens in humans, domestic animals, and environmental soil samples from the same locality: prevalence and transmission considerations in coastal Odisha, India.","OBJECTIVES: Regions with limited sanitation facilities have higher rates of infections with various enteric pathogens. It is therefore important to identify different hosts and their relative contribution to pathogen shedding into the environment, and to assess the subsequent health risks to humans.
METHODS: In this study, human faecal (n=310), animal faecal (n=150), and environmental (soil) samples (n=40) were collected from the same locality and screened for selected enteric pathogens by immunochromatography and/or polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: At least 1 microbial agent was detected in 49.0%, 44.7%, and 40.0% of the samples from human, animals, and soil, respectively. Among humans, rotavirus was predominantly detected (17.4%) followed by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (15.4%), Shigella (13.8), and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) (9.7%). Among animals, STEC was detected most frequently (28.0%), and EPEC was the major enteric pathogen detected in soil (30.0%). The detection rate of rotavirus was higher among younger children (≤2 years) than among older children. Single infections were more commonly detected than multiple infections in humans (p<0.01), unlike the observations in animal and soil samples. For diarrhoeagenic E. coli and Shigella, most of the human and animal isolates showed close relatedness, suggesting possible cross-infection between humans and domesticated animals in the area studied.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides an improved understanding of the distribution of major enteric pathogens coexisting in humans and animals in the region, thereby suggesting a high potential for possible transmission among livestock and communities residing in the studied locality.","['Shrivastava AK', 'Mohakud NK', 'Panda S', 'Patra SD', 'Kumar S', 'Sahu PS']",2020,42,,Epidemiol Health,"Shrivastava AK, et al.

Intimate adherence of E. coli O157 and invasion of S. flexneri in the host intestinal epithelial cells is mainly mediated by Intimin and IpaB proteins, respectively. In this study, we have synthesized chimera of immunodominant regions of Intimin (eae) and IpaB (ipaB) designated as EI and expressed it in Lactococcus lactis (LL-EI) to develop a combinatorial oral vaccine candidate. Immune parameters and protective efficacy of orally administered LL-EI were assessed in the murine model. Significant EI-specific serum IgG, IgA, and fecal IgA antibody titer were observed in the LL-EI group. Considerable increase in EI-specific splenocyte proliferation and a concurrent upregulation of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines was observed in LL-EI immunized mice. Flow cytometry analysis also revealed a significant increase in CD4 and CD8 cell counts in LL-EI immunized group compared to PBS, LL control group.In vitro studies using LL-EI immunized mice sera showed substantial protection against bacterial adhesion and invasion caused by E. coli O157 and Shigella flexneri¸ respectively. LL-EI immunized group challenged with E. coli O157 ceased fecal shedding within 6 days, and mice challenged with S. flexneri showed 93% survival with minimal bacterial load in the lungs. Our results indicate that LL-EI immunization elicits systemic, mucosal and cell-mediated immune responses, and can be a promising candidate for oral vaccine development against these pathogens.","['Sagi S', 'Konduru B', 'Parida M']",2020,85,,Int Immunopharmacol,"Sagi S, et al.

32463817,SipD and IpaD induce a cross-protection against Shigella and Salmonella infections.,"Salmonella and Shigella species are food- and water-borne pathogens that are responsible for enteric infections in both humans and animals and are still the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the emerging countries. The existence of multiple Salmonella and Shigella serotypes as well as the emergence of strains resistant to antibiotics require the development of broadly protective therapies. Those bacteria utilize a Type III Secretion System (T3SS), necessary for their pathogenicity. The structural proteins composing the T3SS are common to all virulent Salmonella and Shigella spp., particularly the needle-tip proteins SipD (Salmonella) and IpaD (Shigella). We investigated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of SipD and IpaD administered by intranasal and intragastric routes, in a mouse model of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) intestinal challenge. Robust IgG (in all immunization routes) and IgA (in intranasal and oral immunization routes) antibody responses were induced against both proteins. Mice immunized with SipD or IpaD were protected against lethal intestinal challenge with S. Typhimurium or Shigella flexneri (100 Lethal Dose 50%). We have shown that SipD and IpaD are able to induce a cross-protection in a murine model of infection by Salmonella and Shigella. We provide the first demonstration that Salmonella and Shigella T3SS SipD and IpaD are promising antigens for the development of a cross-protective Salmonella-Shigella vaccine.

32446727,High rate of resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin among Shigella spp. isolates at three children's referral hospitals in Northeast Iran.,"Acute dysentery is a prevalent case of hospital admission in developing countries, whose most common cause is believed to be Shigella species. Treatment failure employing oral or intravenous antibiotics is an increasing problem among children with dysentery. This is a prospective descriptive study that aims to find the antibiotic resistance pattern of Shigella spp. isolates from children with acute diarrhea in three children's referral hospitals in Mashhad, northeast-Iran. Between February 2018 to September 2019, a total of 233 stool samples were collected from children with inflammatory diarrhea. Shigella spp. were identified by culture and biochemical standard tests. Moreover, polyvalent Shigella antisera were used for serogrouping. The antibiotic susceptibility was performed by disk diffusion method. During the 9-month study period, a total of 94 non-duplicate clinical Shigella spp. were identified by culture and biochemical tests. Based on slide agglutination with appropriate group-specific polyvalent antisera, Shigella sonnei (70.2%) was found to be the most prevalent Shigella spp. followed by S. flexeneri (23.4%), S. dysentery (1%). Among isolates, S. boydii was not detected and five isolates (5.3%) were nonserotypable isolates. The resistance rate of Shigella spp. to azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, doxycycline and cefixime was 25.5%, 43.6%, 3.8%, 82.9%, 15.9%, 26.6%, 40.4%, 57.4%, 41.4%, 22.3%, respectively. The results revealed that the resistance of Shigella spp. to the three most commonly utilized antibiotics (azithromycin, ceftriaxone and, cefixime) is too high to recommend them as empirical therapy for children with acute dysentery in this city.","['Salimiyan Rizi K', 'Farsiani H', 'Sasan MS']",2020,26,9,J Infect Chemother,"Salimiyan Rizi K, et al.

METHOD: This was a prospective case-control study with follow-up, conducted in a sentinel facility of Global Enteric Multicenter Study in Mirzapur, a rural community of Bangladesh between 2007 and 2010. Children aged 0-59 months who presented with MSD and seizure constituted the cases whereas those who did not have seizure comprised the controls. MSD was defined if the episodes were associated with dehydration or dysentery or required hospitalisation with diarrhoea or dysentery. All enrolled children were followed up at home within 50-90 days of enrolment. A total of 64 cases and 128 randomly selected controls formed the analysable dataset.
RESULTS: The result of logistic regression analysis after adjusting for potential confounders revealed that shigellosis (Shigella species, OR = 5.34, 95% CI = 2.37-12.04) particularly S. flexneri (OR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.48-7.57), S. flexneri 6 (OR = 23.24, 95% CI = 2.79-193.85), S. sonnei (OR = 6.90, 95% CI = 2.34-19.85); norovirus (OR = 6.77, 95% CI = 1.69-27.11), fever (OR = 16.75, 95% CI = 1.81-154.70) and loss of consciousness (OR = 35.25, 95% CI = 1.71-726.20) were the independent risk factors for seizure in MSD children. At enrolment, cases had lower WHZ (P = 0.006) compared to their peers, follow-up anthropometrics showed significant improvement in WHZ (P < 0.001) and WAZ (P < 0.05), whereas deterioration in HAZ (P < 0.001) in both cases and controls.
CONCLUSION: Childhood MSD episodes particularly due to Shigella and norovirus are often associated with seizure. Prompt identification and appropriate management of children with shigellosis may reduce occurrence and adverse consequences of seizure linked with MSD.","['Afroze F', 'Das SK', 'Ahmed S', 'Sarmin M', 'Shaly NJ', 'Khan SH', 'Shahid ASMSB', 'Shahrin L', 'Saha H', 'Alam T', 'Faruque ASG', 'Shahunja KM', 'Chisti MJ', 'Ahmed T']",2020,25,8,Trop Med Int Health,"Afroze F, et al.

Species identification, phylogenetic typing of 44 previously diagnosed Shigella isolates, and frequency of virulence genes and loci, virA, virB, virF, ipaBCD, ial, sen, and set1A were investigated through performing several PCR assays. Distribution of virulence genes among Shigella phylogenetic clades and species was determined by the statistical analysis. The identities of 40 isolates out of 44 were confirmed as Shigella, and these isolates were classified in four phylogenetic clades, S1 (7.5%), S2 (52.5%), S3 (20%), and S5 (20%) and 4 species, S. sonnei (52.5%), S. flexneri (22.5%), S. dysenteriae (20%), and S. boydii (5%).

A significant statistically association was also determined between set1A and Shigella phylogenetic clades. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of invasion-associated locus (ial) was determined and mapped on Shigella genome through in silico analysis. The current study shows the distribution of Shigella isolates and its key virulence genes within the five recently described phylogenetic clades for the first time in the Asia.

32326929,Burden of laboratory-confirmed shigellosis infections in Guatemala 2007-2012: results from a population-based surveillance system.,"BACKGROUND: We describe the epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of culture-confirmed Shigella infections in facility-based surveillance sites in Guatemala. Current studies using quantitative molecular diagnostics suggest Shigella may contribute most to the global diarrheal disease burden. Since identification of Shigella requires culturing techniques using stool specimens and few laboratories in Guatemala routinely culture for this pathogen, little is known about the true burden of Shigella in Guatemala or, importantly, the antimicrobial resistance patterns.
METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data were collected on 5399 patients with acute diarrhea (≥3 loose stools in 24 h) from June 2007-August 2012. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
RESULTS: Five percent (261) of stool specimens yielded Shigella spp. The annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed infections ranged from 5.0 to 24.1 per 100,000 persons in Santa Rosa and 0.3 to 6.2 per 100,000 in Quetzaltenango; 58% of cases occurred in children < 5 years of age. Thirty patients were hospitalized; one patient died. Oral rehydration or intravenous solution was used to treat 72% of hospitalized and 15% of ambulatory cases. Fifty-nine percent of cases were S. flexneri and 51% of cases were MDR.
CONCLUSIONS: Shigella is an important cause of bacterial diarrhea in children and prevalence of MDR highlights the importance of appropriate treatment regimens. This study demonstrates that strengthening laboratory capacity in Guatemala can help determine causes which can lead to prevention of diarrheal diseases, particularly in children. Such capacity building is also critical for rapid detection and control of public health threats at their source and therefore for global health security.","['Hegde S', 'Benoit SR', 'Arvelo W', 'Lindblade K', 'López B', 'McCracken JP', 'Bernart C', 'Roldan A', 'Bryan JP']",2019,19,Suppl 3,BMC Public Health,"Hegde S, et al.

Owing to the different incidences in males and females, this study aims to analyze the features involved in the transmission of shigellosis among male (subscript m) and female (subscript f) individuals using a newly developed sex-based model.
METHODS: The data of reported shigellosis cases were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2017. A sex-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious/Asymptomatic-Recovered (SEIAR) model was applied to explore the dataset, and a sex-age-based SEIAR model was applied in 2010 to explore the sex- and age-specific transmissions.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2017, 130 770 shigellosis cases (including 73 981 male and 56 789 female cases) were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model exhibited a significant fitting effect with the shigellosis data (P <  0.001). The median values of the shigellosis transmission were 2.3225 × 10
CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of shigellosis differed among male and female individuals. The transmissibility between the genders was higher than that within the genders, particularly female-to-male transmission. The most important route in children (age ≤ 5 years) was transmission from the elderly (age ≥ 60 years).

We adapted a human in vitro M cell model to physiological bacterial infections, expression of fluorescent localization reporters and long-term three-dimensional time-lapse microscopy. This approach allows following key steps of M cell infection dynamics at subcellular resolution, from the apical onset to basolateral epithelial dissemination. We focused on the intracellular pathogen Shigella flexneri, classically reported to transcytose through M cells to initiate bacillary dysentery in humans, while eliciting poorly protective immune responses. Our workflow was critical to reveal that S. flexneri develops a bimodal lifestyle within M cells leading to rapid transcytosis or delayed vacuolar rupture, followed by direct actin motility-based propagation to neighboring enterocytes. Moreover, we show that Listeria monocytogenes, another intracellular pathogen sharing a tropism for M cells, disseminates in a similar manner and evades M cell transcytosis completely. We established that actin-based M cell-to-enterocyte spread is the major dissemination pathway for both pathogens and avoids their exposure to basolateral compartments in our system. Our results challenge the notion that intracellular pathogens are readily transcytosed by M cells to inductive immune compartments in vivo, providing a potential mechanism for their ability to evade adaptive immunity.","['Rey C', 'Chang YY', 'Latour-Lambert P', 'Varet H', 'Proux C', 'Legendre R', 'Coppée JY', 'Enninga J']",2020,16,4,PLoS Pathog,"Rey C, et al.

32256968,Development of Silica-Immobilized Vaccines for Improving Thermo-Tolerance and Shelf-Life.,"INTRODUCTION: It is estimated that 50% of vaccines produced annually are wasted because effectivity is dependent on protein structure and heat exposure disrupts the intermolecular interactions that maintain this structure. Since 90% of vaccines require a temperature-controlled supply chain, it is necessary to create a cold chain system to minimize vaccine waste. We have developed a more sustainable technology via the adsorption of Invasion Plasmid Antigen D (IpaD) onto mesoporous silica gels, improving the thermal stability of protein-based therapeutics.
METHODS: The solution depletion method using UV-Vis was utilized to study the adsorption of IpaD onto silica gels. The silica-IpaD complex is heated above the denaturing temperature of the protein and then the IpaD is removed using N,N-Dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (LDAO) and their secondary structure is tested using circular dichroism (CD).
RESULTS: Pore diameter, pore volume and surface area were characterized for seven different silica gels. Silica gels designated as 6389, 6378, and 6375 had an adsorption percentage above 95% at pore volumes of 2.2, 2.8 and 3.8 cm
CONCLUSION: We have successfully increased the thermo-tolerance for IpaD using mesoporous silica and continue to further optimize mesoporous silica's physiochemical properties to improve adsorption and desorption yields.","['Montoya N', 'Barr K', 'Kirchhoff B', 'Reyes E', 'Umana J', 'Nichol K', 'Hartman E', 'Picking W', 'Gao FP', 'Corbin DR', 'Shiflett MB']",2020,13,Suppl 2,Kans J Med,"Montoya N, et al.

32252626,Complete genome sequence and annotation of the laboratory reference strain Shigella flexneri serotype 5a M90T and genome-wide transcriptional start site determination.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery in humans. Shigella invades cells of the colonic mucosa owing to its virulence plasmid-encoded Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS), and multiplies in the target cell cytosol. Although the laboratory reference strain S. flexneri serotype 5a M90T has been extensively used to understand the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, its complete genome sequence is not available, thereby greatly limiting studies employing high-throughput sequencing and systems biology approaches.
RESULTS: We have sequenced, assembled, annotated and manually curated the full genome of S. flexneri 5a M90T. This yielded two complete circular contigs, the chromosome and the virulence plasmid (pWR100). To obtain the genome sequence, we have employed long-read PacBio DNA sequencing followed by polishing with Illumina RNA-seq data. This provides a new hybrid strategy to prepare gapless, highly accurate genome sequences, which also cover AT-rich tracks or repetitive sequences that are transcribed. Furthermore, we have performed genome-wide analysis of transcriptional start sites (TSS) and determined the length of 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) at typical culture conditions for the inoculum of in vitro infection experiments. We identified 6723 primary TSS (pTSS) and 7328 secondary TSS (sTSS). The S. flexneri 5a M90T annotated genome sequence and the transcriptional start sites are integrated into RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx) and RSAT (http://embnet.ccg.unam.mx/rsat/) databases to use their analysis tools in the S. flexneri 5a M90T genome.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first complete genome for S. flexneri serotype 5a, specifically the laboratory reference strain M90T. Our work opens the possibility of employing S. flexneri M90T in high-quality systems biology studies such as transcriptomic and differential expression analyses or in genome evolution studies. Moreover, the catalogue of TSS that we report here can be used in molecular pathogenesis studies as a resource to know which genes are transcribed before infection of host cells. The genome sequence, together with the analysis of transcriptional start sites, is also a valuable tool for precise genetic manipulation of S. flexneri 5a M90T. Further, we present a new hybrid strategy to prepare gapless, highly accurate genome sequences. Unlike currently used hybrid strategies combining long- and short-read DNA sequencing technologies to maximize accuracy, our workflow using long-read DNA sequencing and short-read RNA sequencing provides the added value of using non-redundant technologies, which yield distinct, exploitable datasets.","['Cervantes-Rivera R', 'Tronnet S', 'Puhar A']",2020,21,1,BMC Genomics,"Cervantes-Rivera R, et al.

32239137,Clinical Outcomes of Drug-resistant Shigellosis Treated With Azithromycin in Bangladesh.,"BACKGROUND: Azithromycin is frequently used to treat shigellosis; however, clinical outcomes are uncertain.
METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study in Bangladesh of patients with invasive diarrhea treated empirically with azithromycin. Susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution and disk diffusion post hoc on all Shigella isolates and clinical response was correlated with in vitro susceptibility.
RESULTS: There were 149 Shigella culture-positive patients in the primary analysis. Infection with Shigella with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin was significantly associated with persistence of diarrhea at day 5 (31% vs 12%; relative risk [RR], 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-5.28), culture positivity at day 5 or 6 (35% vs 5%; RR, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.84-14.85), and a higher rate of overnight hospitalization (58% vs 39%; RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.06-2.09). Shigella flexneri was more common than Shigella sonnei (58% vs 36%); however, S. sonnei constituted most of the isolates with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin (67%) and most of the multidrug-resistant strains (54%); thus, poor clinical outcomes were associated with S. sonnei. The current epidemiological cutoff for S. flexneri of ≥16 µg/mL to define decreased susceptibility to azithromycin was clinically predictive of poor outcome. Patients with S. sonnei and a low MIC (4 µg/mL) still had elevated rates of persistent diarrhea and culture positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documents worse clinical outcomes for S. flexneri with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin, as well as S. sonnei, and supports the utility of susceptibility testing and clinical breakpoints for azithromycin. S. sonnei is an emerging drug-resistant threat.

32213334,The forgotten tale of Brazilian phage therapy.,"The use of bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections (known as phage therapy) is considered a possible solution to the antimicrobial resistance crisis. However, phage therapy is not a new concept. The discovery of phages in the early 20th century was closely tied to clinical practice, and phage therapy quickly spread around the world. The use of phage therapy in South America in the previous century is still shrouded in mystery and has been mentioned only briefly in recent scientific literature. Research on Brazilian reference collections of medical texts showed that Brazil was an important, but so far little-known, player of phage therapy, uncovering interesting priority claims and missing pieces of phage therapy history. Of note, there is the widespread use of phages against bacillary dysentery and staphylococcal infections, with José da Costa Cruz from the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) as Brazil's leading expert and pioneer. This Historical Review about historical phage use in Brazil fills the gaps in our knowledge about the so-called golden years of phage therapy, providing information about successful experiences that can be useful against dangerous pathogens in our time.","['Almeida GMF', 'Sundberg LR']",2020,20,5,Lancet Infect Dis,Almeida GMF and Sundberg LR.

32163758,"In silico design of a vaccine candidate based on autotransporters and HSP against the causal agent of shigellosis, Shigella flexneri.","Shigellosis is a diarrheal disease that causes high mortality every year, especially in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. Recently, resistance strains to antibiotic therapy are in the rise and the World Health Organization prioritizes the development of a safe vaccine against the most common causal agent of shigellosis, Shigella flexneri. This pathogen uses autotransporter proteins such as SigA, Pic and Sap to increase virulence and some of them have been described as highly immunogenic proteins. In this study, we used immune-informatics analysis to identify the most antigenic epitope as a vaccine candidate on three passenger domains of auto-transporter proteins encoded on the pathogenic island SHI-1, to induce immunity against S. flexneri. Epitope identification was done using various servers such as Bepipred, Bcepred, nHLAPRED, NetMHCII, Rankpep and IEDB and the final selection was done based on its antigenicity using the VaxiJen server. Moreover, to enhance immunity, the GroEL adjuvant was added to the final construct as a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist. On the other hand, to predict the tertiary structure, the I-TASSER server was used, and the best model was structurally validated using the ProSA-web software and the Ramachandran plot. Subsequently, the model was refined and used for docking and molecular dynamics analyses with TLR2, which demonstrated an appropriate and stable interaction. In summary, a potential subunit vaccine candidate, that contains B and T cell epitopes with proper physicochemical properties was designed. This multiepitope vaccine is expected to elicit robust humoral and cellular immune responses and vest protective immunity against S. flexneri.","['León Y', 'Zapata L', 'Salas-Burgos A', 'Oñate A']",2020,121,,Mol Immunol,"León Y, et al.

32120067,"Investigation of a foodborne outbreak of Shigella sonnei in Ireland and Northern Ireland, December 2016: the benefits of cross-border collaboration and commercial sales data.","OBJECTIVES: To describe a cross-border foodborne outbreak of Shigella sonnei that occurred in Ireland and Northern Ireland (NI) in December 2016 whilst also highlighting the valuable roles of sales data and international collaboration in the investigation and control of this outbreak.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-border outbreak control team was established to investigate the outbreak.
METHODS: Epidemiological, microbiological, and environmental investigations were undertaken. Traditional analytical epidemiological studies were not feasible in this investigation. The restaurant chain provided sales data, which allowed assessment of a possible increased risk of illness associated with exposure to a particular type of heated food product (product A).
RESULTS: Confirmed cases demonstrated sole trimethoprim resistance: an atypical antibiogram for Shigella isolates in Ireland. Early communication and the sharing of information within the outbreak control team facilitated the early detection of the international dimension of this outbreak. A joint international alert using the European Centre for Disease Control's confidential Epidemic Intelligence Information System for Food- and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses (EPIS-FWD) did not reveal further cases outside of the island of Ireland. The outbreak investigation identified that nine of thirteen primary case individuals had consumed product A from one of multiple branches of a restaurant chain located throughout the island of Ireland. Product A was made specifically for this chain in a food production facility in NI. S. sonnei was not detected in food samples from the food production facility. Strong statistical associations were observed between visiting a branch of this restaurant chain between 5 and 9 December 2016 and eating product A and developing shigellosis.

31957253,Shigella impairs human T lymphocyte responsiveness by hijacking actin cytoskeleton dynamics and T cell receptor vesicular trafficking.,"Strategies employed by pathogenic enteric bacteria, such as Shigella, to subvert the host adaptive immunity are not well defined. Impairment of T lymphocyte chemotaxis by blockage of polarised edge formation has been reported upon Shigella infection. However, the functional impact of Shigella on T lymphocytes remains to be determined. Here, we show that Shigella modulates CD4+ T cell F-actin dynamics and increases cell cortical stiffness. The scanning ability of T lymphocytes when encountering antigen-presenting cells (APC) is subsequently impaired resulting in decreased cell-cell contacts (or conjugates) between the two cell types, as compared with non-infected T cells. In addition, the few conjugates established between the invaded T cells and APCs display no polarised delivery and accumulation of the T cell receptor to the contact zone characterising canonical immunological synapses. This is most likely due to the targeting of intracellular vesicular trafficking by the bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors IpaJ and VirA. The collective impact of these cellular reshapings by Shigella eventually results in T cell activation dampening. Altogether, these results highlight the combined action of T3SS effectors leading to T cell defects upon Shigella infection.","['Samassa F', 'Ferrari ML', 'Husson J', 'Mikhailova A', 'Porat Z', 'Sidaner F', 'Brunner K', 'Teo TH', 'Frigimelica E', 'Tinevez JY', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Thoulouze MI', 'Phalipon A']",2020,22,5,Cell Microbiol,"Samassa F, et al.

The overall prevalence of Shigella species was found to be 7.9% (n = 160). The predominant Shigella specie was S. flexneri (n = 155, 96.8%) followed by S. boydii (n = 5, 3.1%). Interestingly, no sample was found positive for S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae. The majority of Shigellosis cases occurred from June to September. Potential risk factors related with Shigellosis were unhygienic latrine usage, bad hand washing, and consumption of unhygienic food and water, and pipe leakage in the sewage system. In this study, we have observed a high number of Shigellosis cases especially those caused by S. flexneri.

31923724,Designing and evaluation of an antibody-targeted chimeric recombinant vaccine encoding Shigella flexneri outer membrane antigens.,"Shigellosis is one of the most common diseases found in the developing countries, especially those countries that are prone flood. The causative agent for this disease is the Shigella species. This organism is one of the third most common enteropathogens responsible for childhood diarrhea. Since Shigella can survive gastric acidity and is an intracellular pathogen, it becomes difficult to treat. Also, uncontrolled use of antibiotics has led to development of resistant strains which poses a threat to public health. Therefore, there is a need for long term control of Shigella infection which can be achieved by designing a proper and effective vaccine. In this study, emphasis was made on designing a candidate that could elicit both B-cell and T-cell immune response. Hence B- and T-cell epitopes of outer membrane channel protein (OM) and putative lipoprotein (PL) from S. flexneri 2a were computationally predicted using immunoinformatics approach and a chimeric construct (chimeric-OP) containing the immunogenic epitopes selected from OM and PL was designed, cloned and expressed in E. coli system. The immunogenicity of the recombinant chimeric-OP was assessed using Shigella antigen infected rabbit antibody. The result showed that the chimeric-OP was a synthetic peptide candidate suitable for the development of vaccine and immunodiagnostics against Shigella infection.","['Kazi A', 'Hisyam Ismail CMK', 'Anthony AA', 'Chuah C', 'Leow CH', 'Lim BH', 'Banga Singh KK', 'Leow CY']",2020,80,,Infect Genet Evol,"Kazi A, et al.

31877366,Antimicrobial mechanism of strictinin isomers extracted from the root of Rosa roxburghii Tratt (Ci Li Gen).,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The root of Rosa roxburghii Tratt (Ci Li Gen) is a kind of Chinese ethnomedicine in Gui Zhou province, used for the treatment of abdominal pain, acute bacillary dysentery, gastroenteritis and other diseases in human and livestock.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to isolate and identify the effective antimicrobial components from the ethyl acetate extract of the Ci Li Gen and to investigate its antimicrobial mechanism afterwards.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective antimicrobial components in the ethyl acetate extract from the Ci Li Gen were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) measured by microdilution technique. The antibacterial mechanism was investigated by the time-kill curve, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) combined with NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS, intracellular esterase activity detected by Flow cytometry, and the ultrastructural changes of the Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM).
RESULTS: The effective antimicrobial component (peak 4) was identified as strictinin isomers by HRMS and NMR. The MIC of strictinin isomers against E. coli was 0.125 mg/mL. With respect to the negative control group, the results of SDS-PAGE and NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS showed that the up-regulated proteins of the strictinin isomers treated group were Metal-binding protein ZinT, 30S ribosomal protein S4 and 50S ribosomal protein L4, while the down-regulated protein was hydroperoxide reductase subunit C. Moreover, in the strictinin isomers treated group, the esterase activity in the E. coli cells was reduced and the bacteria E. coli became atrophied, pitted and contorted, and the surface of E. coli was rough and blurred.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the above results, the antimicrobial mechanism of strictinin isomers against E. coli were oxidative stress and protein synthesis disorder, which inhibited the activity of the enzymes required for bacterial growth and metabolism. These findings reflected the pleiotropic effects of strictinin isomers, making it a promising antimicrobial agent for pharmaceutical research.","['Ma Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang H', 'Sun W', 'Li Z', 'Zhang F', 'Zhang H', 'Chen F', 'Zhang H', 'An J', 'He C']",2020,250,,J Ethnopharmacol,"Ma Y, et al.

31818261,"Incidence, clinical implications and impact on public health of infections with Shigella spp. and entero-invasive Escherichia coli (EIEC): results of a multicenter cross-sectional study in the Netherlands during 2016-2017.","BACKGROUND: Shigella spp. and entero-invasive E. coli (EIEC) use the same invasive mechanism to cause diarrheal diseases. Public health regulations apply only to Shigella spp. infections, but are hampered by the lack of simple methods to distinguish them from EIEC. In the last decades, molecular methods for detecting Shigella spp. and EIEC were implemented in medical microbiological laboratories (MMLs). However, shigellosis cases identified with molecular techniques alone are not notifiable in most countries. Our study investigates the impact of EIEC versus Shigella spp. infections and molecular diagnosed shigellosis versus culture confirmed shigellosis for re-examination of the rationale for the current public health regulations.
METHODS: In this multicenter cross-sectional study, fecal samples of patients suspected for gastro-enteritis, referred to 15 MMLs in the Netherlands, were screened by PCR for Shigella spp. or EIEC. Samples were cultured to discriminate between the two pathogens. We compared risk factors, symptoms, severity of disease, secondary infections and socio-economic consequences for (i) culture-confirmed Shigella spp. versus culture-confirmed EIEC cases (ii) culture positive versus PCR positive only shigellosis cases.
RESULTS: In 2016-2017, 777 PCR positive fecal samples with patient data were included, 254 of these were culture-confirmed shigellosis cases and 32 were culture-confirmed EIEC cases. EIEC cases were more likely to report ingestion of contaminated food and were less likely to be men who have sex with men (MSM). Both pathogens were shown to cause serious disease although differences in specific symptoms were observed. Culture-negative but PCR positive cases were more likely report travel or ingestion of contaminated food and were less likely to be MSM than culture-positive cases. Culture-negative cases were more likely to suffer from multiple symptoms. No differences in degree of secondary infections were observed between Shigella spp. and EIEC, and culture-negative and culture-positive cases.
CONCLUSIONS: No convincing evidence was found to support the current guidelines that employs different measures based on species or detection method. Therefore, culture and molecular detection methods for Shigella spp. and EIEC should be considered equivalent for case definition and public health regulations regarding shigellosis. Differences were found regarding risks factors, indicating that different prevention strategies may be required.","['van den Beld MJC', 'Warmelink E', 'Friedrich AW', 'Reubsaet FAG', 'Schipper M', 'de Boer RF', 'Notermans DW', 'Petrignani MWF', 'van Zanten E', 'Rossen JWA', 'Friesema IHM', 'Kooistra-Smid AMDM', 'IBESS working group']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"van den Beld MJC, et al.

31816068,Consensus Report on Shigella Controlled Human Infection Model: Conduct of Studies.,"Shigella causes morbidity and mortality worldwide, primarily affecting young children living in low-resource settings. It is also of great concern due to increasing antibiotic resistance, and is a priority organism for the World Health Organization. A Shigella vaccine would decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with shigellosis, improve child health, and decrease the need for antibiotics. Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) are useful tools in vaccine evaluation for early up- or down-selection of vaccine candidates and potentially useful in support of licensure. Over time, the methods employed in these models have become more uniform across sites performing CHIM trials, although some differences in conduct persist. In November 2017, a Shigella CHIM workshop was convened in Washington, District of Columbia. Investigators met to discuss multiple aspects of these studies, including study procedures, clinical and immunological endpoints, and shared experiences. This article serves as a uniform procedure by which to conduct Shigella CHIM studies.","['Talaat KR', 'Bourgeois AL', 'Frenck RW', 'Chen WH', 'MacLennan CA', 'Riddle MS', 'Suvarnapunya AE', 'Brubaker JL', 'Kotloff KL', 'Porter CK']",2019,69,Suppl 8,Clin Infect Dis,"Talaat KR, et al.

31816067,Consensus Report on Shigella Controlled Human Infection Model: Immunological Assays.,"Moderate to severe diarrhea caused by Shigella is a global health concern due to its substantial contribution to morbidity and mortality in children aged <5 years in low- and middle-income countries. Although antibiotic treatment can be effective, emerging antimicrobial resistance, limited access, and cost affirm the role of vaccines as the most attractive countermeasure. Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) represent a valuable tool for assessing vaccine efficacy and potentially accelerating licensure. Currently, immunological analysis during CHIM studies is customized based on vaccine type, regimen, and administration route. Additionally, differences in type of immunoassays and procedures used limit comparisons across studies. In November 2017, an expert working group reviewed Shigella CHIM studies performed to date and developed consensus guidelines on prioritization of immunoassays, specimens, and collection time points. Immunoassays were ranked into 3 tiers, with antibodies to Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) being the highest priority. To facilitate comparisons across clinical studies, a second workshop was conducted in December 2017, which focused on the pathway toward a recognized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine serum immunoglobulin G titers against Shigella LPS. The consensus of the meeting was to establish a consortium of international institutions with expertise in Shigella immunology that would work with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control to establish a harmonized ELISA, produce a reference sera, and identify a reliable source of Shigella LPS for global utilization. Herein we describe efforts toward establishing common procedures to advance Shigella vaccine development, support licensure, and ultimately facilitate vaccine deployment and uptake.","['Kaminski RW', 'Pasetti MF', 'Aguilar AO', 'Clarkson KA', 'Rijpkema S', 'Bourgeois AL', 'Cohen D', 'Feavers I', 'MacLennan CA']",2019,69,Suppl 8,Clin Infect Dis,"Kaminski RW, et al.

31816065,Consensus Report on Shigella Controlled Human Infection Model: Clinical Endpoints.,"The Shigella controlled human infection model (CHIM) is valuable for assessing candidate Shigella vaccine efficacy and potentially accelerating regulatory approval. The Shigella CHIM is currently being conducted at 3 sites in the United States using Shigella flexneri 2a strain 2457T and Shigella sonnei strain 53G. Shigellosis can present variably as watery diarrhea alone or with dysentery, and can be accompanied by manifestations including fever, abdominal cramps, tenesmus, and malaise. For comparability, it is important to harmonize the primary clinical endpoint. An expert working group was convened on 2 February 2018 to review clinical data from Shigella CHIM studies performed to date and to develop a consensus primary endpoint. The consensus endpoint enabled ""shigellosis"" to present as severe diarrhea or moderate diarrhea or dysentery. The latter 2 criteria are met when concurrent with fever of 38.0°C and/or vomiting, and/or a constitutional/enteric symptom graded at least as ""moderate"" severity. The use of a blinded independent committee to adjudicate the primary endpoint by subject was also regarded as important. As safety of volunteers in challenge studies is of paramount importance and treatment timing can affect primary outcomes, a standard for early antibiotic administration was established as follows: (1) when the primary endpoint is met; (2) if a fever of ≥39.0°C develops; or (3) if the study physician deems it appropriate. Otherwise, antibiotics are given at 120 hours postinfectious challenge. The working group agreed on objective and subjective symptoms to be solicited, and standardized methods for assessing subject-reported severity of symptoms.","['MacLennan CA', 'Riddle MS', 'Chen WH', 'Talaat KR', 'Jain V', 'Bourgeois AL', 'Frenck R', 'Kotloff K', 'Porter CK']",2019,69,Suppl 8,Clin Infect Dis,"MacLennan CA, et al.

31804202,PECULIARITIES OF CYTOKINE RESPONSE IN CHILDREN WITH SHIGELLOSIS AND CONCOMITANT CYTOMEGALOVIRUS INFECTION.,"The article presents the results of a comparative analysis of the level of interleukins of children with Shigellosis in different periods of the disease depending on the presents of CMV-infection in patients. To achieve the goal, 63 children aged from three to eight years old with Shigellosis were examined, who were treated at the Regional Children's Infectious Clinical Hospital of Kharkiv, Ukraine. It has been established that the presence of CMV in patients with Shigellosis leads to the development of cytokine imbalance which persists until the period of early convalescence. In the acute period of Shigellosis in children with CMV infection, the level of IL-1β significantly increases with unreliable fluctuations in the indices of TNF-α and IL-4. In children with Shigellosis without comorbidities, an increase in the level of all cytokines is recorded. In children with monoinfection to the period of convalescence, a significant dynamics of decrease in the levels of all interleukins was observed with their indicators approaching the physiological norm. In case of Shigellosis in children with CMV, the content of IL-1β and IL-4 was still significantly high. Violation of the normalization of the cytokine profile of patients with Shigellosis on the background of CMV infection may be one of the leading factors in the torpid clinical recovery, the formation of an unfavorable course of the disease. In our opinion, these features of the cytokine response of patients must be considered during the period of rehabilitation and follow-up.","['Bukiy S', 'Olkhovskaya О', 'Kucherenko O', 'Olkhovsky E', 'Ogienko V']",2019,,295,Georgian Med News,"Bukiy S, et al.

31734154,"Heterogeneity in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and shigella infections in children under 5 years of age from 11 African countries: a subnational approach quantifying risk, mortality, morbidity, and stunting.","BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea, a global cause of child mortality and morbidity, is linked to adverse consequences including childhood stunting and death from other diseases. Few studies explore how diarrhoeal mortality varies subnationally, especially by cause, which is important for targeting investments. Even fewer examine indirect effects of diarrhoeal morbidity on child mortality. We estimated the subnational distribution of mortality, morbidity, and childhood stunting attributable to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and shigella infection in children younger than 5 years from 11 eastern and central African countries. These pathogens are leading causes of diarrhoea in young children and have been linked to increased childhood stunting.
METHODS: We combined proxy indicators of morbidity and mortality risk from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys with published relative risks to estimate the potential distribution of diarrhoeal disease risk. To estimate subnational burden, we used country-specific or WHO region-specific morbidity and mortality estimates and distributed them subnationally by three indices that integrate relevant individual characteristics (ie, underweight, probability of receiving oral rehydration treatment of diarrhoea, and receiving vitamin A supplementation) and household characteristics (ie, type of drinking water and sanitation facilities).
FINDINGS: Characterising ETEC and shigella subnational estimates of indirect morbidity (infection-attributable stunting) and indirect mortality (stunting-related deaths from other infectious diseases) identified high-risk areas that could be missed by traditional metrics. Burundi and Democratic Republic of the Congo had the highest ETEC-associated and shigella-associated mortality and stunting rates. Mozambique, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zimbabwe had the greatest subnational heterogeneity in most ETEC and shigella mortality measures. Inclusion of indirect ETEC and shigella mortality in burden estimates resulted in a 20-30% increase in total ETEC and shigella mortality rates in some subnational areas.
INTERPRETATION: Understanding the indirect mortality and morbidity of diarrhoeal pathogens on a subnational level will strengthen disease control strategies and could have important implications for the relative impact and cost-effectiveness of new enteric vaccines. Because our methods rely on publicly available data, they could be employed for national planning.

31725799,Activation of Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion requires a host-induced conformational change to the translocon pore.,"Type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs) are conserved bacterial nanomachines that inject virulence proteins (effectors) into eukaryotic cells during infection. Due to their ability to inject heterologous proteins into human cells, these systems are being developed as therapeutic delivery devices. The T3SS assembles a translocon pore in the plasma membrane and then docks onto the pore. Docking activates effector secretion through the pore and into the host cytosol. Here, using Shigella flexneri, a model pathogen for the study of type 3 secretion, we determined the molecular mechanisms by which host intermediate filaments trigger docking and enable effector secretion. We show that the interaction of intermediate filaments with the translocon pore protein IpaC changed the pore's conformation in a manner that was required for docking. Intermediate filaments repositioned residues of the Shigella pore protein IpaC that are located on the surface of the pore and in the pore channel. Restricting these conformational changes blocked docking in an intermediate filament-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that a host-induced conformational change to the pore enables T3SS docking and effector secretion, providing new mechanistic insight into the regulation of type 3 secretion.","['Russo BC', 'Duncan JK', 'Wiscovitch AL', 'Hachey AC', 'Goldberg MB']",2019,15,11,PLoS Pathog,"Russo BC, et al.

Until now, there is no approved vaccine against the disease. Therefore, the present study was planned to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine against Shigella spp., the causative agents of the disease based on the immunoinformatic tools. For this end, firstly seven conserved antigens of the bacteria, including IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, IpaD, OmpC, OmpF and VirG were selected. Then, linear B-cell epitope mapping of these proteins was carried out and top-ranked and shared epitopes were selected based on antigenicity, allergenicity, stability, toxicity and physicochemical properties for further analysis. In next step, B-cell derived T-cell epitopes were determined and appropriate epitopes were selected for incorporation into the final construct. Moreover, the selected epitopes and two mucosal adjuvants including ctxB and LT-IIc were joined using appropriate linkers. The three dimensional structure of the final construct was modeled and evaluated in term of structural quality and presence of conformational B-cell epitopes. Furthermore, binding affinity of the proposed vaccine to MHC I and II molecules were evaluated through molecular docking method using Hex 8.0. as well as the stability of the vaccine-MHC complexes was monitored by molecular dynamics method using the NAMD graphical user interface embedded in visual molecular dynamics. Finally, to evaluate the immunogenicity of the designed protein, the protein was administered to BALB/c mice and the serum IgG was determined by ELISA. The results indicated that the proposed vaccine has high structural quality and binding affinity to both MHC I and II molecules. Moreover, molecular dynamics studies confirmed that the vaccine-MHC docked complexes were stable during simulation time. Animal study showed that the proposed protein is able to evoke mice's humoral immune response. In sum, the results suggested that the proposed candidate vaccine could be considered as a promising anti-shigellosis vaccine.","['Nosrati M', 'Hajizade A', 'Nazarian S', 'Amani J', 'Namvar Vansofla A', 'Tarverdizadeh Y']",2019,116,,Mol Immunol,"Nosrati M, et al.

Although azithromycin is recommended for treatment of shigellosis, there are currently no CLSI susceptibility breakpoints, accordingly no routine antimicrobial susceptibility test is performed in the clinical laboratory. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence, resistance profile and molecular epidemiology of azithromycin non-susceptible Shigella strains in Israel during a three year period. Shigella isolates (n = 1,170) referred to the National Reference Center during 2014-2016, were included in this study. Serotyping was performed by slide agglutination. Resistance genes, mph(A) and erm(B), were identified by PCR and the phenotype profile was determined by broth microdilution (BMD). Genetic relatedness was assessed by wgMLST. Decreased susceptibility to azithromycin (DSA) phenotype and genotype were detected in various Shigella species and serotypes related to diverse genetic backgrounds and antimicrobial profiles: 6% (26/423) of Shigella flexneri and 2% (16/747) of Shigella sonnei displayed DSA (MIC16 mg/L). Correlation of this phenotype with the presence of mph(A) and erm(B) genes was confirmed. All DSA-strains displayed resistance to ≥3 different antimicrobial classes. Among DSA-strains, 14% were resistant to quinolones and 5% displayed resistance to ceftriaxone. Most of these strains (32/42) were isolated from children in the southern and central regions of Israel. Clonality and significant relatedness was confirmed by PFGE and wgMLST. The presence of macrolide resistance genes among the different species and lineages reflects the transmissible nature of these genes. The emergence of DSA-Shigella reinforces the necessity to establish clinical breakpoints that would warrant routine testing, reporting and surveillance for this drug of choice.","['Ezernitchi AV', 'Sirotkin E', 'Danino D', 'Agmon V', 'Valinsky L', 'Rokney A']",2019,14,10,PLoS One,"Ezernitchi AV, et al.

31578543,Mapping of Shigella flexneri's tissue distribution and type III secretion apparatus activity during infection of the large intestine of guinea pigs.,"Shigella spp. are bacterial pathogens that invade the human colonic mucosa using a type III secretion apparatus (T3SA), a proteinaceous device activated upon contact with host cells. Active T3SAs translocate proteins that carve the intracellular niche of Shigella spp. Nevertheless, the activation state of the T3SA has not been addressed in vivo. Here, we used a green fluorescent protein transcription-based secretion activity reporter (TSAR) to provide a spatio-temporal description of S. flexneri T3SAs activity in the colon of Guinea pigs. First, we observed that early mucus release is triggered in the vicinity of luminal bacteria with inactive T3SA. Subsequent mucosal invasion showed bacteria with active T3SA associated with the brush border, eventually penetrating into epithelial cells. From 2 to 8 h post-challenge, the infection foci expanded, and these intracellular bacteria displayed homogeneously high-secreting activity, while extracellular foci within the lamina propria featured bacteria with low secretion activity. We also found evidence that within lamina propria macrophages, bacteria reside in vacuoles instead of accessing the cytosol. Finally, bacteria were cleared from tissues between 8 and 24 h post-challenge, highlighting the hit-and-run colonization strategy of Shigella. This study demonstrates how genetically encoded reporters can contribute to deciphering pathogenesis in vivo.","['Nigro G', 'Arena ET', 'Sachse M', 'Moya-Nilges M', 'Marteyn BS', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Campbell-Valois FX']",2019,77,7,Pathog Dis,"Nigro G, et al.

Many immunogenic antigens have been introduced as candidate vaccines against Shigella, including N-terminal region of IpaD antigen (NIpaD).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of O-metylated free trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (TMC NPs) in the oral delivery of NIpaD.
METHODS: TMC was synthesized by a two-step method from high molecular weight chitosan. The recombinant NIpaD protein was used as the immunogen. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and characterized by gel electrophoresis. The NIpaD-loaded TMC NPs were synthesized by ionic gelation method and were characterized by electron microscopy. NPs were orally administered to guinea pigs and specific humoral and mucosal immune responses were assessed by serum IgG and secretory IgA, respectively. The protectivity of the formulation was assessed by keratoconjunctivitis (Sereny) test.
RESULTS: The immunized guinea pigs showed a significant raise in rNIpaD-specific serum IgG and faecal IgA titers. Specific secretory IgA was detected in eye-washes. Sereny test results showed that immunized animals vaccinated with IpaD-loaded TMC NPS tolerated the wild type of Shigella flexneri 2a in Sereny test. However, in the group immunized with NIpaD antigen and non-immunized group, no increase was observed in antibody titer against NIpaD. These animals were infected following the challenge with Shigella flexneri 2a (p<0.0152).
CONCLUSION: The recombinant rNIpaD formulated with TMC obtained from high molecular weight chitosan, can be considered as a mucosal vaccine against Shigella flexneri through oral route.","['Akbari MR', 'Saadati M', 'Honari H', 'Ghorbani HM']",2019,16,3,Iran J Immunol,"Akbari MR, et al.

Using X-ray surface scattering, we observed that bacterial Shiga toxin compresses lipid packing in a gel phase monolayer upon binding to its cellular receptor, the glycolipid Gb3. This toxin-induced reorganization of lipid packing reached beyond the immediate membrane patch that the protein was bound to, and linkers separating the Gb3 carbohydrate and ceramide moieties modulated the toxin's capacity to compress the membrane. Within a natural membrane, asymmetric compression of the toxin-bound leaflet could provide a mechanism to initiate narrow membrane bending, as observed upon toxin entry into cells. Such lipid compression and long-range membrane reorganization by glycolipid-binding proteins represent novel concepts in membrane biology that have direct implications for the construction of endocytic pits in clathrin-independent endocytosis.","['Watkins EB', 'Majewski J', 'Chi EY', 'Gao H', 'Florent JC', 'Johannes L']",2019,19,10,Nano Lett,"Watkins EB, et al.

This paper describes the development of robust in vitro and in vivo tools to study antibiotic efficacy against Shigella flexneri. A novel bioluminescent S. flexneri strain (S. flexneri lux1) was generated, which can be used in a mammalian epithelial cell co-culture assay to evaluate antibiotic intracellular and extracellular efficacy. In addition, the S. flexneri lux1 strain was used with an intraperitoneal (IP) murine model of shigellosis to test the efficacy of ciprofloxacin and ampicillin. Both antibiotics significantly reduced the observed radiance from the gastrointestinal tissue of infected mice compared to vehicle control. Furthermore, plated gastrointestinal tissue homogenate confirmed antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the S. flexneri infection. However, in contrast to the results generated with tissue homogenate, the radiance data was not able to distinguish between the efficacy of ampicillin and ciprofloxacin. Compared to traditional methods, these models can be utilized for efficient screening of novel antibiotics aiding in the discovery of new treatments against shigellosis.","['McCloskey MC', 'Shaheen S', 'Rabago L', 'Hulverson MA', 'Choi R', 'Barrett LK', 'Arnold SLM']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"McCloskey MC, et al.

Sixty pigs were housed in 20 pens each containing three pigs: pigs in four pens received 2 kg/tonne of a product containing kitasamycin (3.1% active) prophylactically in their food starting 4 days before B. hyodysenteriae challenge (group 1); pigs in four pens were challenged and received the same dose therapeutically once one pig in a pen showed diarrhoea (group 2); four pens were challenged and received 4 kg/tonne of the product therapeutically (group 3); four pens were challenged but not medicated (group 4); two pens were unmedicated and unchallenged (group 5) and two pens received 2 kg/tonne and were unchallenged (group 6). Pigs were monitored for B. hyodysenteriae excretion and disease.
RESULTS: Macrolide resistance was widespread, and mutations in the 23S rRNA gene were identified in 23 isolates. Four isolates with kitasamycin MICs < 5 μg/mL were considered susceptible. Following experimental challenge, 10 of 12 unmedicated pigs developed SD. No pigs receiving kitasamycin prophylactical or therapeutically developed SD. Medicated pigs shed low numbers of B. hyodysenteriae in their faeces.
CONCLUSIONS: Kitasamycin can help control SD in pigs infected with susceptible isolates of B. hyodysenteriae.","['La T', 'Phillips ND', 'Dunlop H', 'Lugsomya K', 'Coiacetto F', 'Hampson DJ']",2019,97,11,Aust Vet J,"La T, et al.

31529306,Rapid culture-based identification of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and Shigella spp./Enteroinvasive E. coli using the eazyplex® EHEC complete assay.,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) are common diarrheagenic bacteria that cause sporadic diseases and outbreaks. Clinical manifestations vary from mild symptoms to severe complications. For microbiological diagnosis, culture confirmation of a positive stool screening PCR test is challenging because of time-consuming methods for isolation of strains, wide variety of STEC pathotypes, and increased emergence of non-classical strains with unusual serotypes. Therefore, molecular assays for the rapid identification of suspect colonies growing on selective media are very useful. In this study, the performance of the newly introduced eazyplex® EHEC assay based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was evaluated using 18 representative STEC and Shigella strains and 31 isolates or positive-enrichment broths that were collected from clinical stool samples following screening by BD MAX™ EBP PCR. Results were compared to real-time PCR as a reference standard. Overall, sensitivities and specificities of the eazyplex® EHEC were as follows: 94.7% and 100% for Shiga toxin 1 (stx1), 100% and 100% for stx2, 93.3% and 97.1% for intimin (eae), 100% and 100% for enterohemolysin A (ehlyA), and 100% and 100% for invasion-associated plasmid antigen H (ipaH) as Shigella spp./EIEC target, respectively. Sample preparation for LAMP took only some minutes, and the time to result of the assay ranged from 8.5 to 13 min. This study shows that eazyplex® EHEC is a very fast and easy to perform molecular assay that provides reliable results as a culture confirmation assay for the diagnosis of STEC and Shigella spp./EIEC infections.","['Penzel A', 'Schützler K', 'Dröge J', 'Mellmann A', 'Ehricht R', 'Engelmann I', 'Braun SD', 'Schleenvoigt BT', 'Löffler B', 'Rödel J']",2020,39,1,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Penzel A, et al.

31492657,Bioengineered Human Organ-on-Chip Reveals Intestinal Microenvironment and Mechanical Forces Impacting Shigella Infection.,"Intestinal epithelial cells are constantly exposed to pathogens and mechanical forces. However, the impact of mechanical forces on infections leading to diarrheal diseases remains largely unknown. Here, we addressed whether flow and peristalsis impact the infectivity of the human pathogen Shigella within a 3D colonic epithelium using Intestine-Chip technology. Strikingly, infection is significantly increased and minimal bacterial loads are sufficient to invade enterocytes from the apical side and trigger loss of barrier integrity, thereby shifting the paradigm about early stage Shigella invasion. Shigella quickly colonizes epithelial crypt-like invaginations and demonstrates the essential role of the microenvironment. Furthermore, by modulating the mechanical forces of the microenvironment, we find that peristalsis impacts Shigella invasion. Collectively, our results reveal that Shigella leverages the intestinal microenvironment by taking advantage of the microarchitecture and mechanical forces to efficiently invade the intestine. This approach will enable molecular and mechanistic interrogation of human-restricted enteric pathogens.","['Grassart A', 'Malardé V', 'Gobaa S', 'Sartori-Rupp A', 'Kerns J', 'Karalis K', 'Marteyn B', 'Sansonetti P', 'Sauvonnet N']",2019,26,3,Cell Host Microbe,"Grassart A, et al.

31482407,Effects of Curcumin and Silymarin on the Shigella dysenteriae and Campylobacter jejuni In vitro.,"OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial properties of silymarin and curcumin have been assessed against several infectious agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic and antibacterial effects of both compounds on the expression of genes among Shigella dysenteriae ATCC 12022 and Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni strain ATCC 33560 standard strains.
METHODS: S. dysenteriae and C. jejuni standard strains were prepared from reference laboratory. Additionally, two clinical multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates were adopted. Silymarin and curcumin stocks were purchased from Sigma Corporation (USA), and after preparation of dilutions (0.5-512 μg/ml), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. Furthermore, the effect of 100 μg/ml of each compound was also evaluated on the expression of two gyrB and 16S rRNA housekeeping genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
RESULTS: Silymarin MIC and MBC were 512 μg/ml and > 512 μg/ml against S. dysenteriae and > 512μg/ml against C. jejuni standard strains, respectively. Moreover, curcumin MIC and MBC concentrations were 256 μg/ml and 512 μg/ml, respectively for ATCC strains. Silymarin down-expressed the expression of gyrB gene in S. dysenteriae and gyrB and 16srRNA gene in C. jejuni significantly (p < 0.05) compared with unexposed strains. In addition, curcumin could down-express the both gyrB and 16S rRNA genes in both strains significantly (p < 0.05). For two MDR clinical isolates, both MIC and MBC of compounds were > 512 μg/ml. Addition of 100 μg/ml curcumin and silymarin to ampicillin (10 μg/ml) lowered the MIC of MDR S. dysenteriae to 256 μg/ml and 512 μg/ml, respectively. However, no MIC change was observed with regard to C. jejuni.
CONCLUSION: In this study, curcumin and silymarin could inhibit the growth of S. dysenteriae and C. jejuni and 100 μg/ml sub-MIC levels exhibited the suppression of housekeeping genes. Combating pathogenic bacteria by compounds alternative to antibiotics in the era of antibiotic resistance is a proper strategy, though more studies using combinations of them are needed.","['Kareem SM', 'Mahmood SS', 'Hindi NK']",2020,51,3,J Gastrointest Cancer,"Kareem SM, et al.

31441879,Epidemiologic features of shigellosis and associated climatic factors in Taiwan.,"The consistent, sporadic transmission of shigellosis in Taiwan necessitates an exploration of risk factors for the occurrence of shigellosis. The purpose of this study was to study the epidemiologic characteristics and the relationship between climatic factors and the incidence of shigellosis in Taiwan. We collected data from cases of shigellosis reported to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) from 2001 to 2016. Climatic data were obtained from the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. The relationships between weather variability and the incidence of shigellosis in Taiwan were determined via Poisson regression analyses. During the 16-year study period, a total of 4171 clinical cases of shigellosis were reported to the Taiwan CDC. Among them, 1926 (46.2%) were classified as confirmed cases. The incidence of shigellosis showed significant seasonality, with the majority of cases occurring in summertime (for oscillation, P < .001). The number of shigellosis cases started to increase when temperatures reached 21°C (r = 0.88, P < .001). Similarly, the number of shigellosis cases began to increase at a relative humidity of 70-74% (r = 0.75, P < .005). The number of shigellosis cases was positively associated with the mean temperature and relative humidity in the period preceding the infection. In conclusion, the occurrence of shigellosis is significantly associated with increasing temperature and relative humidity in Taiwan. Therefore, these factors could be regarded as warning signals indicating the need to implement preventive measures.","['Chen CC', 'Lin CY', 'Chen KT']",2019,98,34,Medicine (Baltimore),"Chen CC, et al.

31414511,WIPF2 promotes Shigella flexneri actin-based motility and cell-to-cell spread.,"Shigella flexneri is an intracellular pathogen that disseminates in colonic epithelial cells through actin-based motility and formation of membrane protrusions at cell-cell contacts, that project into adjacent cells and resolve into vacuoles, from which the pathogen escapes, thereby achieving cell-to-cell spread. Actin nucleation at the bacterial pole relies on the recruitment of the nucleation-promoting factor N-WASP, which activates the actin nucleator ARP2/3. In cells, the vast majority of N-WASP exists as a complex with WIP. The involvement of WIP in N-WASP-dependent actin-based motility of various pathogens, including vaccinia virus and S. flexneri, has been highly controversial. Here, we show that WIPF2 was the only WIP family member expressed in the human colonic epithelial cell line HT-29, and its depletion impaired S. flexneri dissemination. WIPF2 depletion increased the number of cytosolic bacteria lacking actin tails (non-motile) and decreased the velocity of motile bacteria. This correlated with a decrease in the recruitment of N-WASP to the bacterial pole, and among N-WASP-positive bacteria, a decrease in actin tail-positive bacteria, suggesting that WIPF2 is required for N-WASP recruitment and activation at the bacterial pole. In addition, when motile bacteria formed protrusions, WIPF2 depletion decreased the number of membrane protrusions that successfully resolved into vacuoles.","['Michard C', 'Yum LK', 'Agaisse H']",2019,21,12,Cell Microbiol,"Michard C, et al.

31374081,Characterizing Shigella species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid in Latin America between 2000-2015.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is the second leading cause of diarrheal death globally. The global burden has been complicated by the emergence of Shigella strains resistant to first line antibiotic treatments such as ciprofloxacin. This study aims to describe the epidemiologic distribution of the most common Shigella species, and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (NA) in Latin America.
METHODS: Laboratory data from 19 countries were obtained through the Latin American Network for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (ReLAVRA) from 2000-2015. The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute reduced susceptibility breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae was used to interpret the disc diffusion tests for Shigella susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and NA. Negative binominal regression was used to analyze longitudinal trends of Shigella isolates antimicrobial susceptibility.
RESULTS: 79,548 Shigella isolates were tested and reported between 2000-2015. The most common isolated species were S. flexneri (49%), and S. sonnei (28%). There was a steady increase in the proportion of S. sonnei isolates within the region(p<0.001). The average annual percentage increase (AAPI) in nonsusceptibility was 18.4% (p<0.001) for ciprofloxacin (baseline = 0.3); and 13.2%(p<0.001) for NA (baseline = 3). AAPI nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin was 13.3% for S. flexneri (p<0.04); and 39.9% for S. sonnei (p<0.001). Honduras, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Chile reported the highest increase in nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin among all Shigella isolates.
CONCLUSION: There is an increasing trend in Shigella nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin and NA, including among the most common shigella species, in Latin America. This rise of nonsusceptibility among Shigella species to commonly used treatments such as ciprofloxacin is alarming and threatens the control and management of this currently treatable infection. Improved data quality, collection and reporting is needed in Latin America to respond effectively to the rising trends observed. This includes the need for quality isolate level epidemiological data; molecular data, and data on antibiotic consumption and use.","['Sati HF', 'Bruinsma N', 'Galas M', 'Hsieh J', 'Sanhueza A', 'Ramon Pardo P', 'Espinal MA']",2019,14,8,PLoS One,"Sati HF, et al.

This study aimed to explore the epidemiological characteristics of the main infectious diseases in Sichuan, a province with a high frequency of natural disasters.
METHODS: Data were collected from the local Centers for Disease Control infectious disease reports from Lu, Shifang and Yuexi counties from 2011 to 2015 and from the baseline survey of the Disaster Mitigation Demonstration Area in Western China in 2016. Principal component regression was used to explore the main influencing factors of respiratory infectious diseases (RIDs).
RESULTS: The incidence rates of RIDs and intestinal infectious diseases (IIDs) in 2015 were 78.99/100,000, 125.53/100,000, 190.32/100,000 and 51.70/100,000, 206.00/100,000, 69.16/100,000 in Lu, Shifang and Yuexi respectively. The incidence rates of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was the highest among RIDs in the three counties. The main IIDs in Lu and Shifang were hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and other infectious diarrhea; however, the main IIDs in Yuexi was bacillary dysentery. The proportions of illiterate and ethnic minorities and per capita disposable income were the top three influencing factors of RIDs.
CONCLUSIONS: TB was the key point of RIDs prevention among the three counties. The key preventable IIDs in Lu and Shifang were HFMD and other infectious diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery was the major IIDs in Yuexi. The incidence rates of RIDs was associated with the population composition, the economy and personal hygiene habits.","['Xue Z', 'Yang Z', 'Sun H', 'Ren J', 'Sun M', 'Li J', 'Zhang A', 'Zheng P', 'Pan P', 'Dou J', 'Shen L', 'Chen Y', 'Li K', 'Feng T', 'Lv Y', 'Bi C', 'Jin L', 'Wang Z', 'Yao Y']",2019,7,,PeerJ,"Xue Z, et al.

Results were presented in forest plot, tables and figures with 95% CI. The Cochrane Q test and I
RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of Shigella species in Ethiopia was 6.6% (95% CI 4.7-8.8). In the subgroup analysis, the highest prevalence was observed among patients in Health facility (8.5%, 95% CI 6.2-11.5) whereas the lowest prevalence was observed in Community based studies (1.6%, 95% CI 0.8-3.4). In addition, Shigella species were highly resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin and multi-drug resistant (MDR) with the pooled resistance proportions of 83.1% (95% CI 75.7-88.6), 84.1% (95% CI 75.6-90.1), 86.5% (95% CI 70.9-94.4) and 83.2% (95% CI 77.1-87.9), respectively.

Subgroup analyses indicated that study years were associated with a decreasing Shigella prevalence over time (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: The pooled estimate showed high burden of Shigella infection and its high proportion of drug resistance pattern to ampicillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin in Ethiopia. Therefore, initiating and scale up of performing drug susceptibility test for each shigellosis case, educate the community and health care providers on appropriate use of antibiotics need to be considered and strengthened.","['Hussen S', 'Mulatu G', 'Yohannes Kassa Z']",2019,18,1,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,"Hussen S, et al.

31276953,Prevalence and molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant Shigella species of food origins and their inactivation by specific lytic bacteriophages.,"Shigella spp. can be isolated from various food sources and is responsible for many outbreaks and sporadic cases of foodborne diseases worldwide. Although Shigella species are known as one of the major foodborne pathogens, a few studies have characterized the prevalence and molecular basis of antibiotic resistance of Shigella spp. isolated from food origins. This study investigated the prevalence of Shigella spp. in a wide range of food samples (1400 samples), and the phenotypic and genotypic basis of antimicrobial resistance of the isolates. In addition, the potential of two Shigella specific phages (vB_SflS-ISF001 and vB_SsoS-ISF002) to control the growth of the isolates in food was tested. Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri were detected in 11 (0.8%) and 8 (0.6%) samples, respectively. The highest prevalence of Shigella spp. was observed in vegetables. Multidrug resistance phenotypes were noticeably frequent and observed in 17 isolates (89.5%) out of 19 isolates. Moreover, 13 (68.4%), 9 (47.4%) and 17 (89.5%) isolates were positive for β-lactamase-encoding, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and tetracycline resistance genes, respectively. Treatment with the phages reduced bacterial counts up to 3 and 4 log when used individually or in cocktail form, respectively. The findings of this study indicate the prevalence of Shigella spp. in food sources and also provide useful information for a better understanding of the molecular aspects of antimicrobial resistance in Shigella spp.. The results also suggest that the combination of vB_SflS-ISF001 and vB_SsoS-ISF002 phages can effectively reduce contamination of two important species of Shigella in food.","['Shahin K', 'Bouzari M', 'Wang R', 'Yazdi M']",2019,305,,Int J Food Microbiol,"Shahin K, et al.

31268120,Antimicrobial-resistance pattern of Shigella species in children: a six-year study in an Iranian referral Hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella species are a frequent cause of shigellosis and shigellosis is considered as one of the most common causes of diarrhea in children. This disease is endemic in many developing countries such as Iran. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and pattern of antimicrobial resistance of Shigella species among pediatric patients with acute diarrhea in Children Medical Center (CMC) Hospital, with a diagnosis of acute diarrhea to CMC Hospital from March 2011 through March 2016. Isolation and identification techniques, as well as the susceptibility tests are described in detail.
RESULTS: Of the 46,795 stool specimens that were sent to the microbiology laboratory of the CMC Hospital for culture and susceptibility testing, 573 (1.2%) were positive for Shigella species. The most common species of Shigella were S. sonnei (n= 335, 58.4%) and S. flexneri (n=229, 40%), followed by S. boydii (n=8, 1.4%) and S. dysenteriae (n=1, 0.2%). S. flexneri was most sensitive to gentamicin (n=17/19, 89%) and amikacin (n=15/18, 83%), while high frequency of resistance to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (n=204/224, 91%) and ampicillin (n=216/228, 95%) was seen. S. boydii was most sensitive to ampicillin (n=5 out of 7, 71%) and cefotaxime (n=6/7, 86%) and the high frequency of resistance was seen against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n=5/7, 71%). For S. sonnei, the highest sensitivity was reported against amikacin and gentamicin (87% and 80%, respectively), while the highest resistance to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (n=325/331, 98%) and ciprofloxacin (n= 66 out of 76, 87%) was reported. Ciprofloxacin was examined on 115 out of 573 isolates and 84 isolates were resistant (73%). Multidrug-resistance (MDR), (i.e. resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobial agents) was classified into 11 distinct patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, S. sonnei was the predominant Shigella species. High frequency of resistance to common antimicrobials such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin limits the empirical therapy for the management of shigellosis in Iran. On the other hand, it should be noted that third-generation cephalosporins can be convenient replacing drugs.","['Mamishi S', 'Arab Yazdi Z', 'Mahmoudi S', 'Moradzadeh M', 'Taghi Haghi Ashtiani M', 'Pourakbari B']",2019,31,4,Ann Ig,"Mamishi S, et al.

31257480,Circular RNA sequencing reveals the molecular mechanism of the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on endometrial receptivity in patients undergoing infertility treatment.,"The present study aimed to determine the profile of differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) in infertile patients treated with acupuncture and moxibustion and verify the role of acupuncture and moxibustion in altering endometrial receptivity (ER). High‑throughput RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of samples from six pairs of patients treated with or without acupuncture and moxibustion were conducted. The reliability of high‑throughput RNA sequencing was validated using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The most significant circRNA functions and pathways were selected by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A circRNA‑miR‑mRNA interaction network was constructed to determine the connection between circRNAs, microRNAs (miRs), and mRNAs. High‑throughput RNA sequencing identified 2,653 circRNAs. A total of 86 circRNAs was differentially expressed, of which 57 were upregulated and 29 were downregulated, between the acupuncture and moxibustion group and the control group. In the GO analysis, the identified BP terms were chromatin modification, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter involved in unfolded protein response, oxidative DNA demethylation, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to hypoxia, and regulation of smooth muscle cell differentiation. The identified CC terms were nucleoplasm, nucleolus, nucleus, histone acetyltransferase complex, and annulate lamellae. The identified MF terms were methylcytosine dioxygenase activity, chromatin binding, zinc ion binding, histone binding, and protein binding. In the KEGG pathway analysis, the identified pathways were protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, degradation of aromatic compounds, shigellosis, mTOR signaling pathway, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and prostate cancer. Circ‑SFMBT2, circ‑BACH1, and circ‑LPAR1 were significantly upregulated (P<0.05) and associated with numerous miRs and mRNAs. Acupuncture and moxibustion could impact ER by regulating the expression of circRNAs.","['Shen J', 'Chen L', 'Cheng J', 'Jin X', 'Mu Y', 'Li Q', 'Xia L', 'Gao Y', 'Xia Y']",2019,20,2,Mol Med Rep,"Shen J, et al.

31250458,A human pathogenic bacterium Shigella proliferates in plants through adoption of type III effectors for shigellosis.,"Shigella, which infects primates, can be transmitted via fresh vegetables; however, its molecular interactions with plants have not been elucidated. Here, we show that four Shigella strains, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri 2a, and S. flexneri 5a, proliferate at different levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. Microscopic studies revealed that these bacteria were present inside leaves and damaged plant cells. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged S. boydii and S. flexneri 5a colonized leaves only, whereas S. flexneri 2a colonized both leaves and roots. Using Shigella mutants lacking type III secretion systems (T3SSs), we found that T3SSs that regulate the pathogenesis of shigellosis in humans also play a central role in bacterial proliferation in Arabidopsis. Strikingly, the immunosuppressive activity of two T3S effectors, OspF and OspG, was required for proliferation of Shigella in Arabidopsis. Of note, delivery of OspF or OspG effectors inside plant cells upon Shigella inoculation was confirmed using a split GFP system. These findings demonstrate that the human pathogen Shigella can proliferate in plants by adapting immunosuppressive machinery used in the original host human.","['Jo SH', 'Lee J', 'Park E', 'Kim DW', 'Lee DH', 'Ryu CM', 'Choi D', 'Park JM']",2019,42,11,Plant Cell Environ,"Jo SH, et al.

31230883,"Role of antigen specific T and B cells in systemic and mucosal immune responses in ETEC and Shigella infections, and their potential to serve as correlates of protection in vaccine development.","The generation of robust systemic and mucosal antibody and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses that are protective, long-lasting, and can quickly be recalled upon subsequent re-exposure to the cognate antigen is the key to the development of effective vaccine candidates. These responses, whether they represent mechanistic or non-mechanistic immunological correlates of protection, usually entail the activation of T cell memory and effector subsets (T-CMI) and induction of long-lasting memory B cells. However, for ETEC and Shigella, the precise role of these key immune cells in primary and secondary (anamnestic) immune responses remains ill-defined. A workshop to address immune correlates for ETEC and Shigella, in general, and to elucidate the mechanistic role of T-cell subsets and B-cells, both systemically and in the mucosal microenvironment, in the development of durable protective immunity against ETEC and Shigella was held at the recent 2nd Vaccines against Shigella and ETEC (VASE) conference in June 2018.

31218775,Critical determinants of human neutrophil peptide 1 for enhancing host epithelial adhesion of Shigella flexneri.,"Human neutrophil peptides (HNPs), also known as human myeloid α-defensins degranulated by infiltrating neutrophils at bacterial infection loci, exhibit broad antomicrobial activities against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. We have made a surprising recent finding that Shigella, a highly contagious, yet poorly adhesive enteric pathogen, exploits human α-defensins including HNP1 to enhance its adhesion to and invasion of host epithelial cells. However, the critical molecular determinants responsible for HNP1-enhanced Shigella adhesion and invasion have yet to be investigated. Using cultured epithelial cells and polarised Caco2 cells as an in vitro infection model, we demonstrated that HNP1 promoted Shigella infection in a structure- and sequence-dependent manner, with two bulky hydrophobic residues, Trp26 and Phe28 important for HNP1 self-assembly, being most critical. The functional importance of hydrophobicity for HNP1-enhanced Shigella infection was further verified by substitutions for Trp26 of a series of unnatural amino acids with straight aliphatic side chains of different lengths. Dissection of the Shigella infection process revealed that bacteria-rather than host cells-bound HNP1 contributed most to the enhancement. Further, mutagenesis analysis of bacterial surface components, while precluding the involvement of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the interaction with HNP1, identified outer membrane proteins and the Type 3 secretion apparatus as putative binding targets of HNP1 involved in enhanced Shigella adhesion and invasion. Our findings provide molecular and mechanistic insights into the mode of action of HNP1 in promoting Shigella infection, thus showcasing another example of how innate immune factors may serve as a double-edged sword in health and disease.","['Liao C', 'Fang K', 'Xiao J', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang B', 'Yuan W', 'Lu W', 'Xu D']",2019,21,10,Cell Microbiol,"Liao C, et al.

31206156,Characterization and immunogenicity of a Shigella flexneri 2a O-antigen bioconjugate vaccine candidate.,"Shigellosis remains a major cause of diarrheal disease in developing countries and causes substantial morbidity and mortality in children. Vaccination represents a promising preventive measure to fight the burden of the disease, but despite enormous efforts, an efficacious vaccine is not available to date. The use of an innovative biosynthetic Escherichia coli glycosylation system substantially simplifies the production of a multivalent conjugate vaccine to prevent shigellosis. This bioconjugation approach has been used to produce the Shigella dysenteriae type O1 conjugate that has been successfully tested in a phase I clinical study in humans. In this report, we describe a similar approach for the production of an additional serotype required for a broadly protective shigellosis vaccine candidate. The Shigella flexneri 2a O-polysaccharide is conjugated to introduced asparagine residues of the carrier protein exotoxin A (EPA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa by co-expression with the PglB oligosaccharyltransferase. The bioconjugate was purified, characterized using physicochemical methods and subjected to preclinical evaluation in rats. The bioconjugate elicited functional antibodies as shown by a bactericidal assay for S. flexneri 2a. This study confirms the applicability of bioconjugation for the S. flexneri 2a O-antigen, which provides an intrinsic advantage over chemical conjugates due to the simplicity of a single production step and ease of characterization of the homogenous monomeric conjugate formed. In addition, it shows that bioconjugates are able to raise functional antibodies against the polysaccharide antigen.","['Ravenscroft N', 'Braun M', 'Schneider J', 'Dreyer AM', 'Wetter M', 'Haeuptle MA', 'Kemmler S', 'Steffen M', 'Sirena D', 'Herwig S', 'Carranza P', 'Jones C', 'Pollard AJ', 'Wacker M', 'Kowarik M']",2019,29,9,Glycobiology,"Ravenscroft N, et al.

31162724,Interfacial amino acids support Spa47 oligomerization and shigella type three secretion system activation.,"Like many Gram-negative pathogens, Shigella rely on a type three secretion system (T3SS) for injection of effector proteins directly into eukaryotic host cells to initiate and sustain infection. Protein secretion through the needle-like type three secretion apparatus (T3SA) requires ATP hydrolysis by the T3SS ATPase Spa47, making it a likely target for in vivo regulation of T3SS activity and an attractive target for small molecule therapeutics against shigellosis. Here, we developed a model of an activated Spa47 homo-hexamer, identifying two distinct regions at each protomer interface that we hypothesized to provide intermolecular interactions supporting Spa47 oligomerization and enzymatic activation. Mutational analysis and a series of high-resolution crystal structures confirm the importance of these residues, as many of the engineered mutants are unable to form oligomers and efficiently hydrolyze ATP in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo evaluation of Shigella virulence phenotype uncovered a strong correlation between T3SS effector protein secretion, host cell membrane disruption, and cellular invasion by the tested mutant strains, suggesting that perturbation of the identified interfacial residues/interactions influences Spa47 activity through preventing oligomer formation, which in turn regulates Shigella virulence. The most impactful mutations are observed within the conserved Site 2 interface where the native residues support oligomerization and likely contribute to a complex hydrogen bonding network that organizes the active site and supports catalysis.

31142259,"Antimicrobial resistance and genetic characterization of Shigella spp. in Shanxi Province, China, during 2006-2016.","BACKGROUND: Shigella spp., facultative anaerobic bacilli of the family Enterobacteriaceae, are one of the most common causes of diarrheal diseases in human worldwide which have become a significant public health burden. So, we aimed to analyze the antimicrobial phenotypes and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in Shigella isolates from patients with diarrhea in Shanxi Province.
RESULTS: During 2006-2016, we isolated a total of 474 Shigella strains (including 337 S. flexneri and 137 S. sonnei). The isolates showed high rates of resistance to traditional antimicrobials, and 26, 18.1 and 3.0% of them exhibited resistance to cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and co-resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, respectively. Notably, 91.1% of these isolates, including 22 isolates that showed an ACTSuT profile, exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). The resistance rates to cephalosporins in S. sonnei isolates were higher than those in S. flexneri. Conversely, the resistance rates to fluoroquinolones were considerably higher in S. flexneri isolates. Among the 123 cephalosporins-resistant isolates, the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was bla
CONCLUSIONS: Coexistence of diverse resistance genes causing the emergence and transmission of MDR might render the treatment of shigellosis difficult. Therefore, continuous surveillance might be needed to understand the actual disease burden and provide guidance for shigellosis.","['Wang Y', 'Ma Q', 'Hao R', 'Zhang Q', 'Yao S', 'Han J', 'Ren B', 'Fan T', 'Chen L', 'Xu X', 'Qiu S', 'Yang H']",2019,19,1,BMC Microbiol,"Wang Y, et al.

31125598,Transcriptional response of Caenorhabditis elegans when exposed to Shigella flexneri.,"In recent years, researchers have begun to use Caenorhabditis elegans as a potential animal model to study Shigella pathogenesis. This study aims to further develop this model using RNA-sequencing to understand which pathways/cellular characteristics are affected and potentially cause death in Shigella-exposed worms. We identified 1631 differentially expressed genes in Shigella-exposed worms (6 h exposure). A number of these genes encode proteins involved in fatty-acid β-oxidation (FAO), antioxidant defense and autophagy. The down-regulation of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases would impede FAO, reducing the overall energy to combat Shigella in the worm's intestinal tract. This is potentially coupled with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may not be fully quenched by antioxidant defense proteins, leading to damaged cellular organelles in the worm's intestinal cells. These cells may undergo autophagy to remove the mounting damage, but may eventually undergo cell death.","['Somasiri P', 'Behm CA', 'Adamski M', 'Wen J', 'Verma NK']",2020,112,1,Genomics,"Somasiri P, et al.

31099740,Use of whole genome sequencing in surveillance for antimicrobial-resistant Shigella sonnei infections acquired from domestic and international sources.,"Shigella species are a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, and Shigella sonnei is the most common species isolated within the United States. Previous surveillance work in Pennsylvania documented increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in S. sonnei associated with reported illnesses. The present study examined a subset of these isolates by whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the relationship between domestic and international isolates, to identify genes that may be useful for identifying specific Global Lineages of S. sonnei and to test the accuracy of WGS for predicting AMR phenotype. A collection of 22 antimicrobial-resistant isolates from patients infected within the United States or while travelling internationally between 2009 and 2014 was chosen for WGS. Phylogenetic analysis revealed both international and domestic isolates were one of two previously defined Global Lineages of S. sonnei, designated Lineage II and Lineage III. Twelve of 17 alleles tested distinguish these two lineages. Lastly, genome analysis was used to identify AMR determinants. Genotypic analysis was concordant with phenotypic resistance for six of eight antibiotic classes. For aminoglycosides and trimethoprim, resistance genes were identified in two and three phenotypically sensitive isolates, respectively.

31039338,Development of FAcE (Formulated Alhydrogel competitive ELISA) method for direct quantification of OAg present in Shigella sonnei GMMA-based vaccine and its optimization using Design of Experiments approach.,"Many formulated vaccines, including 1790GAHB Shigella sonnei GMMA-based vaccine, contain Alhydrogel (aluminum hydroxide), consequently the antigen content must be determined in the formulated final vaccine product, as required by regulatory authorities. The direct quantification of antigens adsorbed on aluminum salts is difficult, and antigens may need to be extracted using laborious and often ineffective desorption procedures. To directly quantify the sugar vaccine target in the LPS of 1790GAHB, we have developed a new FAcE (Formulated Alhydrogel competitive ELISA) method. FAcE is an immunoassay based on the competition between S. sonnei LPS, coated on the ELISA plate, and the LPS in formulated S. sonnei GMMA, in binding a specific monoclonal antibody. To optimize the method, which is as easy to perform as a standard ELISA, we have applied a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach. A model was found to define the significant assay variables and to predict their impact on the output responses. Results obtained using the DOE optimized FAcE assay showed that the method is sensitive (0.02 μg/mL lower detection limit), precise, reproducible and can accurately quantify independently formulated drug products, making it a useful tool in routine tests of Alhydrogel-based vaccines. We are currently using this method to determine S. sonnei vaccine potency, stability and lot-to-lot variations, and are broadening its applicability to quantify active ingredients of other Alhydrogel GMMA-vaccines and in multivalent vaccines formulations.","['Necchi F', 'Carducci M', 'Pisoni I', 'Rossi O', 'Saul A', 'Rondini S']",2019,471,,J Immunol Methods,"Necchi F, et al.

31035948,Plasmids of Shigella flexneri serotype 1c strain Y394 provide advantages to bacteria in the host.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella flexneri has an extremely complex genome with a significant number of virulence traits acquired by mobile genetic elements including bacteriophages and plasmids. S. flexneri serotype 1c is an emerging etiological agent of bacillary dysentery in developing countries. In this study, the complete nucleotide sequence of two plasmids of S. flexneri serotype 1c strain Y394 was determined and analysed.
RESULTS: The plasmid pINV-Y394 is an invasive or virulence plasmid of size 221,293 bp composed of a large number of insertion sequences (IS), virulence genes, regulatory and maintenance genes. Three hundred and twenty-eight open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in pINV-Y394, of which about a half (159 ORFs) were identified as IS elements. Ninety-seven ORFs were related to characterized genes (majority of which are associated with virulence and their regulons), and 72 ORFs were uncharacterized or hypothetical genes. The second plasmid pNV-Y394 is of size 10,866 bp and encodes genes conferring resistance against multiple antibiotics of clinical importance. The multidrug resistance gene cassette consists of tetracycline resistance gene tetA, streptomycin resistance gene strA-strB and sulfonamide-resistant dihydropteroate synthase gene sul2.
CONCLUSIONS: These two plasmids together play a key role in the fitness of Y394 in the host environment. The findings from this study indicate that the pathogenic S. flexneri is a highly niche adaptive pathogen which is able to co-evolve with its host and respond to the selection pressure in its environment.","['Parajuli P', 'Rajput MI', 'Verma NK']",2019,19,1,BMC Microbiol,"Parajuli P, et al.

31020303,Tyrosine based cationic acrylates as potent antimicrobial agents against shigellosis.,"Incorporation of tyrosine within synthetic macromolecules via the controlled radical polymerization technique is of particular interest due to the presence of a phenolic group in tyrosine imparting high inhibition potential. Tyrosine incorporation is also fascinating from a medicinal point of view since this particular amino acid is present in several natural antimicrobial peptides as a key constituent. This study describes a facile strategy to integrate the naturally occurring proteinogenic amino acid tyrosine within a polyacrylate system via the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization technique to construct potent bioactive macromolecules against the microbial strain S. flexneri 2a causing shigellosis. The cationic charge and amphiphilic features inherited from the amino acid tyrosine mimic the function of natural antimicrobial peptides. A library of tyrosine polyacrylates has been synthesized to investigate the effect of molecular weight on antimicrobial activity. The time-dependent morphological switching observed via FESEM measurement revealed membrane rupture followed by leakage of cellular constituents as an effective mechanism of action of the biomimetic tyrosine-based polymers. The details of membrane disintegration and depolarization due to alteration in membrane potential have been evaluated via flow cytometric and fluorescence microscopic measurements. Most importantly, the side chain tyrosine-based polymers show fascinating biocidal features against the Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacterial strain, the major causative agent of nosocomial infections. The broad spectrum nature of the polymers has been further investigated against the fungus Aspergillus niger and another Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli.","['Datta LP', 'Dutta D', 'Chakraborty A', 'Das TK']",2019,7,6,Biomater Sci,"Datta LP, et al.

31015451,Critical role of bacterial dissemination in an infant rabbit model of bacillary dysentery.,"The bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri causes 270 million cases of bacillary dysentery (blood in stool) worldwide every year, resulting in more than 200,000 deaths. A major challenge in combating bacillary dysentery is the lack of a small-animal model that recapitulates the symptoms observed in infected individuals, including bloody diarrhea. Here, we show that similar to humans, infant rabbits infected with S. flexneri experience severe inflammation, massive ulceration of the colonic mucosa, and bloody diarrhea. T3SS-dependent invasion of epithelial cells is necessary and sufficient for mediating immune cell infiltration and vascular lesions. However, massive ulceration of the colonic mucosa, bloody diarrhea, and dramatic weight loss are strictly contingent on the ability of the bacteria to spread from cell to cell. The infant rabbit model features bacterial dissemination as a critical determinant of S. flexneri pathogenesis and provides a unique small-animal model for research and development of therapeutic interventions.","['Yum LK', 'Byndloss MX', 'Feldman SH', 'Agaisse H']",2019,10,1,Nat Commun,"Yum LK, et al.

Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms underlying its nuclear translocation and signaling remain unclear. In the following study, we constructed series of OspF truncated mutants to identify the OspF nuclear localization signals which mapped to the amino acids 209-239. Moreover, we found that this sequence was essential to bind the canonical nuclear import adaptor importin α1. Additionally, the 209-239 residues deletion mutant could not bind the importin α1. Consistent with this observation, our results revealed that OspF can inhibit the MAPK signals in the nucleus. Moreover, OspF translocate to the nucleus through Ran-GTPase and importin α1-dependent manner. These results can provide new avenues for depicting the biological functions of OspF during Shigella infection.","['Zhao H', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu P', 'Wang J', 'Li H']",2019,35,5,World J Microbiol Biotechnol,"Zhao H, et al.

A workshop was conducted to review clinical endpoints from controlled human challenge studies, field studies in naïve adult travelers and pediatric studies in low-middle income countries and to develop a consensus on clinical endpoints for future vaccine trials. Following sequential presentations on different study designs (CHIM, travelers' efficacy and pediatric efficacy), workshop participants broke into three simultaneous workgroups focused on those study designs to discuss a number of topics key to clinical endpoints specific to each study design. Previously utilized endpoints were reviewed with an eye towards potentially novel endpoints for future studies and consideration of the disease parameters and spectrum of disease targeted for prevention. The strength of support among workshop participants for the use of various endpoints is summarized as are recommendations for additional endpoints to be considered in future studies.

30928856,The impact of climate variability on infectious disease transmission in China: Current knowledge and further directions.,"BACKGROUND: Climate change may lead to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and pose public health challenges to human health and the already overloaded healthcare system. It is therefore important to review current knowledge and identify further directions in China, the largest developing country in the world.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the relationship between climate variability and infectious disease transmission in China in the new millennium. Literature was identified using the following MeSH terms and keywords: climatic variables [temperature, precipitation, rainfall, humidity, etc.] and infectious disease [viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases].
RESULTS: Fifty-eight articles published from January 1, 2000 to May 30, 2018 were included in the final analysis, including bacterial diarrhea, dengue, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, HFRS, HFMD, Schistosomiasis. Each 1 °C rise may lead to 3.6%-14.8% increase in the incidence of bacillary dysentery disease in south China. A 1 °C rise was corresponded to an increase of 1.8%-5.9% in the weekly notified HFMD cases in west China. Each 1 °C rise of temperature, 1％ rise in relative humidity and one hour rise in sunshine led to an increase of 0.90%, 3.99% and 0.68% in the monthly malaria cases, respectively. Climate change with the increased temperature and irregular patterns of rainfall may affect the pathogen reproduction rate, their spread and geographical distribution, change human behavior and influence the ecology of vectors, and increase the rate of disease transmission in different regions of China.
CONCLUSION: Exploring relevant adaptation strategies and the health burden of climate change will assist public health authorities to develop an early warning system and protect China's population health, especially in the new 1.5 °C scenario of the newly released IPCC special report.","['Yi L', 'Xu X', 'Ge W', 'Xue H', 'Li J', 'Li D', 'Wang C', 'Wu H', 'Liu X', 'Zheng D', 'Chen Z', 'Liu Q', 'Bi P', 'Li J']",2019,173,,Environ Res,"Yi L, et al.

30924299,Shifting national surveillance of Shigella infections toward geno-serotyping by the development of a tailored Luminex assay and NGS workflow.,"The phylogenetically closely related Shigella species and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) are responsible for millions of episodes of bacterial dysenteriae worldwide. Given its distinct epidemiology and public health relevance, only Shigellae are subject to mandatory reporting and follow-up by public health authorities. However, many clinical laboratories struggle to differentiate non-EIEC, EIEC, and Shigella in their current workflows, leading to inaccuracies in surveillance and rising numbers of misidentified E. coli samples at the National Reference Centre (NRC). In this paper, we describe two novel tools to enhance Shigella surveillance. First, we developed a low-cost Luminex-based multiplex assay combining five genetic markers for species identification with 11 markers for serotype prediction for S. sonnei and S. flexneri isolates. Using a test panel of 254 clinical samples, this assay has a sensitivity of 100% in differentiation of EIEC/Shigella pathotype from non-EIEC strains, and 68.7% success rate in distinction of Shigella and EIEC. A novel, and particularly successful marker was a Shigella-specific deletion in the spermidine acetyltransferase gene speG, reflecting its metabolic decay. For Shigella serotype prediction, the multiplex assay scored a sensitivity and specificity of 96.6% and 98.4%, respectively. All discrepancies were analyzed with whole-genome sequencing and shown to be related to causative mutations (stop codons, indels, and promoter mutations) in glycosyltransferase genes. This observation spurred the development of an in silico workflow which extracts the Shigella serotype from Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, taking into account gene functionality.

30831222,Burden and risk factors of Shigella sonnei shigellosis among children aged 0-59 months in hyperendemic communities in Israel.,"OBJECTIVES: Ultraorthodox Jewish populations living in towns with good sanitary infrastructure but with conditions of crowding have been the epicenter of Shigella sonnei shigellosis outbreaks. In this study, the incidence and risk factors of S. sonnei shigellosis in children living in an ultraorthodox community were determined.
METHODS: Data for the years 2000-2013 for all reported culture-proven S. sonnei shigellosis cases in children aged 0-59 months in the city of Elad were compared with data for the rest of the sub-district. Environmental factors obtained through parental interviews were evaluated for 78 incident cases of S. sonnei shigellosis and 141 community controls, matched by age, sex, and neighborhood. Conditional logistic regression models were performed.
RESULTS: Cyclic epidemics of S. sonnei shigellosis occurred every 2 years. The mean annual incidence was 10.0 per 1000 children in Elad (95% confidence interval 7.9-12.6) vs. 3.8 per 1000 children (95% confidence interval 3.3-4.4) in the sub-district (p<0.001). Concurrent diarrheal disease in family members, having the same person in the daycare center responsible for food handling and changing diapers, and more rooms and sinks in the center, were positively associated with S. sonnei shigellosis, while children's hand-washing before meals was inversely associated.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of S. sonnei shigellosis in ultraorthodox communities is high. Enhanced hygiene interventions are required for epidemic control.","['Cohen D', 'Korin H', 'Bassal R', 'Perry Markovich M', 'Sivan Y', 'Goren S', 'Muhsen K']",2019,82,,Int J Infect Dis,"Cohen D, et al.

30824790,Mutational convergence acts as a major player in adaptive parallel evolution of Shigella spp.,"Shigella spp., emerging from multiple origins of Escherichia coli, poses a significant health threat as a causative agent of bacillary dysentery. While multiple serotypes of four different species have evolved via independent lineages, Shigella spp. are designated as a single pathotype, primarily because of their common mode of pathogenesis. Convergent horizontal transfer events have so far been attributed to the commonalities in the evolution of virulence across diverse lineages. However, the role of mutational convergence in such parallel evolution is not yet well understood. Here we have carried out a genome-wide analysis of Shigella strains from all four species to detect the core genes (i.e. the ones present in all analyzed strains) acquiring convergent mutations of evolutionarily recent origin. Simulation studies show non-neutral accumulation of these convergent mutations across species, suggesting their adaptive role in the evolution of Shigella virulence. S. dysenteriae strain 197, representing highly virulent type 1 (Sd1) clone, carries excessively high number of core genes with recent convergent mutations compared to other analyzed strains. We propose that this high frequency of adaptive convergence in S. dysenteriae strain 197 could be linked to recent re-emergence of the Sd1 clone and its increased resistance to antimicrobials.","['Thomas AK', 'Preetha S', 'Omanakuttan A', 'Vidyullata L', 'Ashokan A', 'Rajachandran V', 'Chattopadhyay S']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Thomas AK, et al.

30791948,A small RNA decreases the sensitivity of Shigella sonnei to norfloxacin.,"OBJECTIVES: Shigella is a human pathogen that causes shigellosis, an acute invasive intestinal infection. Recent studies in the model bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) provided evidence that small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) can contribute to antimicrobial resistance or susceptibility. One of the sRNAs is SdsR, which increases sensitivity of E. coli against fluoroquinolone by repressing the drug efflux pump, TolC. However, no reports exist about the effect of SdsR on fluoroquinolone resistance in Shigella sonnei (S. sonnei). In this study, we established the effect of SdsR on the sensitivity of S. sonnei to norfloxacin.
DATA DESCRIPTION: We tested the effects of SdsR and SdsRv2 on fluoroquinolone resistance in S. sonnei in vivo. SdsRv2 is a synthetic version which promotes higher binding stability to tolC mRNA. Overexpression of either SdsR or SdsRv2 lowers the expression of tolC mRNA. Interestingly, SdsR and SdsRv2 promote the growth of S. sonnei in the presence of a sub-inhibitory concentration of norfloxacin. Mutant carrying SdsRv2 showed the highest growth advantage. This phenotype is opposite to the effect of SdsR reported in E. coli. This study is an example that demonstrates the difference in the phenotypic effect of a highly conserved sRNA in two closely related bacteria.","['Gan IN', 'Tan HS']",2019,12,1,BMC Res Notes,Gan IN and Tan HS.

30782131,Evaluation of the impact of shigellosis exclusion policies in childcare settings upon detection of a shigellosis outbreak.,"BACKGROUND: In the event of a shigellosis outbreak in a childcare setting, exclusion policies are typically applied to afflicted children to limit shigellosis transmission. However, there is scarce evidence of their impact.
METHODS: We evaluated five exclusion policies: Children return to childcare after: i) two consecutive laboratory tests (either PCR or culture) do not detect Shigella, ii) a single negative laboratory test (PCR or culture) does not detect Shigella, iii) seven days after beginning antimicrobial treatment, iv) after being symptom-free for 24 h, or v) 14 days after symptom onset. We also included four treatments to assess the policy options: i) immediate, effective treatment; ii) effective treatment after laboratory diagnosis; iii) no treatment; iv) ineffective treatment. Relying on published data, we calculated the likelihood that a child reentering childcare would be infectious, and the number of childcare-days lost per policy.
RESULTS: Requiring two consecutive negative PCR tests yielded a probability of onward transmission of < 1%, with up to 17 childcare-days lost for children receiving effective treatment, and 53 days lost for those receiving ineffective treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the policies analyzed, requiring negative PCR testing before returning to childcare was the most effective to reduce the risk of shigellosis transmission, with one PCR test being the most effective for the least childcare-days lost.","['Carias C', 'Undurraga EA', 'Hurd J', 'Kahn EB', 'Meltzer MI', 'Bowen A']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Carias C, et al.

We have sequenced, for the first time, the complete genome of S. flexneri serotype 3b (strain SFL1520). We used a hybrid sequencing method--both long-read MinION Flow (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and short-read MiSeq (Illumina) sequencing to generate a high-quality reference genome. The SFL1520 chromosome was found to be ∼4.58 Mb long, with 4,729 coding sequences. Despite sharing a substantial number of genes with other publicly available S. flexneri genomes (2,803), the SFL1520 strain contains 1,926 accessory genes. The phage-related genes accounted for 8% of the SFL1520 genome, including remnants of the Sf6 bacteriophage with an intact O-acetyltransferase gene specific to serotype 3b. The SFL1520 chromosome was also found to contain a multiple-antibiotic resistance cassette conferring resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline, which was potentially acquired from a plasmid via transposases. The phylogenetic analysis based on core genes showed a high level of similarity of SFL1520 with other S. flexneri serotypes; however, there were marked differences in the accessory genes of SFL1520. In particular, a large number of unique genes were identified in SFL1520 suggesting significant horizontal gene acquisition in a relatively short time period. The major virulence traits of SFL1520 (such as serotype conversion and antimicrobial resistance) were associated with horizontal gene acquisitions highlighting the role of horizontal gene transfer in S. flexneri diversity and evolution.","['Parajuli P', 'Deimel LP', 'Verma NK']",2019,11,3,Genome Biol Evol,"Parajuli P, et al.

In addition, few studies have been conducted to quantify the lag and cumulative risk of diarrheal disease due to floods in Guangxi, China. Our study aimed to identify different types of diarrheal diseases that were sensitive to floods and to quantify their lag and cumulative impact. A matched analysis based on time series data of floods and infectious disease from 2006 to 2010 was conducted in Guangxi, China. Each flood day was treated as an independent unit in our study. A simplified assumption that each day of the flood confers the same risk was adopted before analysis. Each flood day was matched to a non-flood day by city and time. Log-linear mixed-effects regression models were used to quantify the association between different types of diarrheal diseases and floods. Lag and cumulative effects were also calculated to get delayed and overall effects. A total of 45,131 diarrhea cases were notified in the study area over the study period. After controlling for the long-term trend, seasonality, and meteorological factors, floods caused a significantly increased risk of total diarrheal diseases. The RR was highest at lag 2 days (RR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.11-1.40). Floods caused a significantly increased risk in bacillary dysentery and in other infectious diarrhea, but not in typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever. Floods were significantly associated with total diarrheal diseases and other infectious diarrhea for both cumulative lag 0-7 and 0-14 days. Our study provides strong evidence of a positive association between floods and diarrheal diseases including bacillary dysentery and other infectious diarrhea in study area. Public health interventions should be taken to prevent a potential risk of these flood-sensitive diarrheal diseases according to the different lag period after floods.","['Liu Z', 'Ding G', 'Zhang Y', 'Lao J', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang J', 'Lu L', 'Liu Q', 'Jiang B']",2019,170,,Environ Res,"Liu Z, et al.

The antibacterial properties of O barrelieri aqueous extract (WOb) against Shigella dysenteriae type 1 were investigated in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: None
RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of WOb were, respectively, 6 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL. The mean minimal bactericidal concentration/minimal inhibitory concentration ratio for WOb against S dysenteriae type 1 was high (˃4); WOb could be classified as a bacteriostatic drug. WOb significantly (P < .01) reduced bacterial density and diarrheal stool weight. WOb decreased nitric oxide production (P < .01) in the large intestine and protected the mucosa of the colon from bacterial destruction.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that O barrelieri aqueous extract possesses bacteriostatic and antidiarrheal activities and reduces damages caused to intestinal mucosa barrier by pathogenic mechanisms of Shigella.

Using in vitro and in vivo models of shigellosis, we found that S. flexneri induces the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) through the nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. Congruently, abrogation of NOD2 or EGFR compromises the ability of S. flexneri to induce IDO1 expression. We observed that the loss of IDO1 function in vivo exacerbates shigellosis by skewing the inflammatory cytokine response, disrupting colon epithelial barrier integrity and consequently limiting the host life-span. Interestingly, administration of recombinant EGF rescued mice from IDO1 inhibition-driven aggravated shigellosis by restoring the cytokine balance and subsequently restricting bacterial growth. This is the first study that underscores the direct implication of the NOD2-EGFR axis in IDO1 production and its crucial homeostatic contributions during shigellosis.

30615105,Co-circulation of Multidrug-resistant Shigella Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in Australia.,"BACKGROUND: In urban Australia, the burden of shigellosis is either in returning travelers from shigellosis-endemic regions or in men who have sex with men (MSM). Here, we combine genomic data with comprehensive epidemiological data on sexual exposure and travel to describe the spread of multidrug-resistant Shigella lineages.
METHODS: A population-level study of all cultured Shigella isolates in the state of Victoria, Australia, was undertaken from 1 January 2016 through 31 March 2018. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses of 545 Shigella isolates were performed at the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory. Risk factor data on travel and sexual exposure were collected through enhanced surveillance forms or by interviews.
RESULTS: Rates of antimicrobial resistance were high, with 17.6% (95/541) and 50.6% (274/541) resistance to ciprofloxacin and azithromycin, respectively. There were strong associations between antimicrobial resistance, phylogeny, and epidemiology. Specifically, 2 major MSM-associated lineages were identified: a Shigellasonnei lineage (n = 159) and a Shigella flexneri 2a lineage (n = 105). Of concern, 147/159 (92.4%) of isolates within the S. sonnei MSM-associated lineage harbored mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to recommended oral antimicrobials: namely, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. Long-read sequencing demonstrated global dissemination of multidrug-resistant plasmids across Shigella species and lineages, but predominantly associated with MSM isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our contemporary data highlight the ongoing public health threat posed by resistant Shigella, both in Australia and globally. Urgent multidisciplinary public health measures are required to interrupt transmission and prevent infection.","['Ingle DJ', 'Easton M', 'Valcanis M', 'Seemann T', 'Kwong JC', 'Stephens N', 'Carter GP', 'Gonçalves da Silva A', 'Adamopoulos J', 'Baines SL', 'Holt KE', 'Chow EPF', 'Fairley CK', 'Chen MY', 'Kirk MD', 'Howden BP', 'Williamson DA']",2019,69,9,Clin Infect Dis,"Ingle DJ, et al.

30602087,Functional Prediction of Hypothetical Proteins from Shigella flexneri and Validation of the Predicted Models by Using ROC Curve Analysis.,"Shigella spp. constitutes some of the key pathogens responsible for the global burden of diarrhoeal disease. With over 164 million reported cases per annum, shigellosis accounts for 1.1 million deaths each year. Majority of these cases occur among the children of the developing nations and the emergence of multi-drug resistance Shigella strains in clinical isolates demands the development of better/new drugs against this pathogen. The genome of Shigella flexneri was extensively analyzed and found 4,362 proteins among which the functions of 674 proteins, termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs) had not been previously elucidated. Amino acid sequences of all these 674 HPs were studied and the functions of a total of 39 HPs have been assigned with high level of confidence. Here we have utilized a combination of the latest versions of databases to assign the precise function of HPs for which no experimental information is available. These HPs were found to belong to various classes of proteins such as enzymes, binding proteins, signal transducers, lipoprotein, transporters, virulence and other proteins. Evaluation of the performance of the various computational tools conducted using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and a resoundingly high average accuracy of 93.6% were obtained. Our comprehensive analysis will help to gain greater understanding for the development of many novel potential therapeutic interventions to defeat Shigella infection.","['Gazi MA', 'Mahmud S', 'Fahim SM', 'Kibria MG', 'Palit P', 'Islam MR', 'Rashid H', 'Das S', 'Mahfuz M', 'Ahmeed T']",2018,16,4,Genomics Inform,"Gazi MA, et al.

32237697,Shigellosis in Poland in 2013-2017.,"AIM: The purpose of this study evaluation of the epidemiological situation of shigellosis in Poland in years 2013-2017.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation was based on analysis of : data gathered and sent to Department of Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases and Surveillance in NIPH-NIH by local and voivodeship sanitary stations in the form of epidemiological questionnaires. It was also based on aggregated data from annual bulletins “Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland” as well as data from shigellosis outbreaks acquired through ROE system (an electronic system created for uploading, transfer and analysis of data from the outbreak investigations). All cases were reported according to the Decision 2008/426/WE.
RESULTS: In the years 2013-2017 in Poland 140 shigellosis cases were reported. Mean incidence per 100 000 was 0.05. A decrease of incidence median for years 2013-2017 was observed comparing to preceding, 5- year period by 0,03. Slightly over half of cases (51%) belonged to the age group 20-44. Majority of cases were males (57.1%). In each year from described period percentage of hospitalizations was over 70%. Imported cases amounted for 28% of all cases reported in that period- most of them being imported from countries from outside UE/ EFTA. In years 2013-2017 there were 10 outbreaks of shigellosis registered, in which 47 persons got ill.
CONCLUSIONS: In years 2013-2017 no clear increasing or decreasing trend in shigellosis cases was observed, however in years when epidemic outbreaks occurred there was a significant increase in the number of cases reported yearly. Because of low number of cases being reported every year, an occurrence of large outbreak may result in seasonal peak of cases shifting, which was the situation in 2017 when most cases onset was in October, while in other years it was in September. High percentage of hospitalizations in cases could mean that severe cases are more readily reported, and in the same time that other cases are underreported. Because the date on shigellosis cases are acquired through general, not shigella-specific questionnaire it may result in incomplete or missing data on exposure (e.g. information on risk group affiliation), and therefore impairs the epidemiological situation assessment. It points the need of introduction Shigella- specific questionnaire.","['Księżak E', 'Polański P', 'Sadkowska-Todys M']",2019,73,4,Przegl Epidemiol,"Księżak E, et al.

30555135,Molecular epidemiology and genetic characterization of Shigella in pediatric patients in Iran.,"Infection with Shigella is considered a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with diarrhea in developing countries, especially in Iran. Due to the importance of country-level epidemiological data, molecular characterization of genetic determinants of Shigella spp. is a necessity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of integron types, bla-CTX-M, bla-SHV and blaTEM β-lactamase genes of Shigella isolates in pediatric patients in Tehran, Iran. In a time period of 18 months from May 2015 to August 2017, 75 Shigella spp. were isolated from non-duplicative diarrheal stool specimens in six different hospitals in Tehran. The isolates from patients were further analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for amplification of the integrons (I, II, III), TEM, SHV, CTX-M15. The prevalence of S. sonnei, S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae and S. boydii were 40 (53.3%), 33 (44%), 1 (1.3%) and 1 (1.3%), respectively. The results of an antimicrobial resistance test showed that the high percentage of resistance to nalidixic acid (NA), ampicillin (AMP) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) included 38 (50.6%), 59 (81.3%) and 64 (88%) isolates, respectively. Further results revealed that 52% and 76% of Shigella isolates carried intI and intII genes, respectively. In this study, the rates of CTX-M (10.7%), SHV (28%) and TEM (21.3%) were determined, all of which were positive for blaCTX-M15. This study showed the high prevalence of multidrug resistant S. sonnei and S. flexneri. Furthermore, it highlighted the increasing integrons (intI and intII) and ESBL genes, especially blaCTX-M15, in Shigella isolates.","['Soltan Dallal MM', 'Ranjbar R', 'Yaghoubi S', 'Rajabi Z', 'Aminharati F', 'Adeli Behrooz H']",2018,26,4,Infez Med,"Soltan Dallal MM, et al.

30532257,Role of a fluid-phase PRR in fighting an intracellular pathogen: PTX3 in Shigella infection.,"Shigella spp. are pathogenic bacteria that cause bacillary dysentery in humans by invading the colonic and rectal mucosa where they induce dramatic inflammation. Here, we have analyzed the role of the soluble PRR Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), a key component of the humoral arm of innate immunity. Mice that had been intranasally infected with S. flexneri were rescued from death by treatment with recombinant PTX3. In vitro PTX3 exerts the antibacterial activity against Shigella, impairing epithelial cell invasion and contributing to the bactericidal activity of serum. PTX3 is produced upon LPS-TLR4 stimulation in accordance with the lipid A structure of Shigella. In the plasma of infected patients, the level of PTX3 amount only correlates strongly with symptom severity. These results signal PTX3 as a novel player in Shigella pathogenesis and its potential role in fighting shigellosis. Finally, we suggest that the plasma level of PTX3 in shigellosis patients could act as a biomarker for infection severity.","['Ciancarella V', 'Lembo-Fazio L', 'Paciello I', 'Bruno AK', 'Jaillon S', 'Berardi S', 'Barbagallo M', 'Meron-Sudai S', 'Cohen D', 'Molinaro A', 'Rossi G', 'Garlanda C', 'Bernardini ML']",2018,14,12,PLoS Pathog,"Ciancarella V, et al.

30519925,Aspherical and Spherical InvA497-Functionalized Nanocarriers for Intracellular Delivery of Anti-Infective Agents.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of polymeric spherical and aspherical invasive nanocarriers, loaded with antibiotic, to access and treat intracellular bacterial infections.
METHODS: Aspherical nanocarriers were prepared by stretching of spherical precursors, and both aspherical and spherical nanocarriers were surface-functionalized with the invasive protein InvA497. The relative uptake of nanocarriers into HEp-2 epithelial cells was then assessed. Nanocarriers were subsequently loaded with a preparation of the non-permeable antibiotic gentamicin, and tested for their ability to treat HEp-2 cells infected with the enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri.
RESULTS: InvA497-functionalized nanocarriers of both spherical and aspherical shape showed a significantly improved rate and extent of uptake into HEp-2 cells in comparison to non-functionalized nanocarriers. Functionalized and antibiotic-loaded nanocarriers demonstrated a dose dependent killing of intracellular S. flexneri. A slight but significant enhancement of intracellular bacterial killing was also observed with aspherical as compared to spherical functionalized nanocarriers at the highest tested concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: InvA497-functionalized, polymer-based nanocarriers were able to efficiently deliver a non-permeable antibiotic across host cell membranes to affect killing of intracellular bacteria. Functionalized nanocarriers with an aspherical shape showed an interesting future potential for intracellular infection therapy.","['Castoldi A', 'Empting M', 'De Rossi C', 'Mayr K', 'Dersch P', 'Hartmann R', 'Müller R', 'Gordon S', 'Lehr CM']",2018,36,1,Pharm Res,"Castoldi A, et al.

30420041,Towards a subunit vaccine from a Shigella flexneri ΔtolR mutant.,"Disruption of one or more components of the Tol-Pal system, involved in maintaining the integrity of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, has been proposed as a method to increase the yield obtained from natural production of outer membrane vesicles (OMV). We present a new OMV-based product, obtained from genetically modified Shigella flexneri 2a with a non-polar deletion in tolR and heat-inactivated (HT-ΔtolR). The S. flexneri ΔtolR strain lead to a higher release of vesicles, more than 8-times when compared to the yield obtained from chemically inactivated wild type strain. S. flexneri mutant strain appeared to be more sensitive to different chemical compounds, including antibiotics, bile salts or human complement and it was also less virulent in both in vitro and in vivo assays. The mutation produced some changes in the LPS O-chain and protein expression. S. flexneri ΔtolR was enriched in long and very long LPS O-chain and expressed a different pattern of surface proteins or lipoproteins. In vitro toxicity and activation properties were determined in Raw 267.4 macrophage cell line. HT-ΔtolR antigenic complex was non-cytotoxic and activation markers, such as MHC-II or CD40, were highly expressed during incubation with this product. Finally, preliminary studies on the antibody response elicited by HT-ΔtolR demonstrated a robust and diverse response in mice. Considering these promising results, HT-ΔtolR antigenic extract appears as a new potential vaccine candidate to face shigellosis.","['Pastor Y', 'Camacho AI', 'Zúñiga-Ripa A', 'Merchán A', 'Rosas P', 'Irache JM', 'Gamazo C']",2018,36,49,Vaccine,"Pastor Y, et al.

30361807,Comparison of Multiplex Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel and Conventional Stool Testing for Evaluation of Diarrhea in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gastrointestinal pathogen panels (GPPs) are increasingly being used for evaluation of diarrhea. The impact of these tests on patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is unknown. We performed a time-interrupted cohort study comparing GPPs and conventional stool evaluation in patients with IBD with diarrhea.
METHODS: We included 268 consecutive patients with IBD who underwent GPP (BioFire Diagnostics
RESULTS: Overall, 41/134 (30.6%) patients tested positive on GPP (18 C. difficile, 17 other bacterial infections, and 6 viral pathogens) versus 14/134 patients (10.4%, all C. difficile) testing positive on conventional testing. Rate of IBD treatment modification in response to stool testing was lower in GPP group as compared conventional stool testing group (35.1 vs. 64.2%, p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, diagnostic evaluation with GPP was associated with three times higher odds of IBD-related hospitalization/surgery/ED visit (95% CI, 1.27-7.14), as compared to conventional stool testing. This negative impact was partly mediated by differences in ordering provider specialty, with non-gastroenterologists more likely to order GPP as compared to gastroenterologists.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected flare of IBD, GPPs have higher pathogen detection rate and lead to lower rate of IBD treatment modification. A diagnostic testing strategy based on GPPs is associated with higher hospital-related healthcare utilization as compared to conventional stool testing, particularly when utilized by non-gastroenterologists.","['Ahmad W', 'Nguyen NH', 'Boland BS', 'Dulai PS', 'Pride DT', 'Bouland D', 'Sandborn WJ', 'Singh S']",2019,64,2,Dig Dis Sci,"Ahmad W, et al.

30307807,"Fluoroquinolone Resistance Mechanisms in Shigella Isolates in Shanghai, China, Between 2010 and 2015.","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of Shigella isolated in Shanghai, China and to determine the genetic basis of its resistance to fluoroquinolones.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 402 strains of Shigella, including 145 Shigella flexneri and 257 Shigella sonnei isolates, were analyzed. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used to determine the susceptibility of the strains to 13 antimicrobials. Minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin was determined by E-test. Mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA and parC and in the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes, including qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac (6')-Ib-cr, were detected by polymerase chain reaction. All the products were then sequenced.
RESULTS: Most of the Shigella isolates were found to be resistant to nalidixic acid (96.4%), streptomycin (96.4%), ampicillin (86.2%), tetracycline (79.8%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (80.6%). S. flexneri isolates showed a significantly higher resistance to cefepime (33.6%), ciprofloxacin (54.2%), norfloxacin (34.1%), and levofloxacin (12.1%) compared with that observed for the S. sonnei strains (χ
CONCLUSIONS: The mutation percentage within the QRDR of S. flexneri was as high as 98.6 in gyrA and 97.9 in parC. The significant abundance of mutations within QRDRs conferred high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance. Moreover, the PMQR genes, particularly qnrS, played an important role in the decreased susceptibility of Shigella to fluoroquinolones.","['Zhang WX', 'Chen HY', 'Tu LH', 'Xi MF', 'Chen M', 'Zhang J']",2019,25,2,Microb Drug Resist,"Zhang WX, et al.

30287127,"Use of quantitative molecular diagnostic methods to assess the aetiology, burden, and clinical characteristics of diarrhoea in children in low-resource settings: a reanalysis of the MAL-ED cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Optimum management of childhood diarrhoea in low-resource settings has been hampered by insufficient data on aetiology, burden, and associated clinical characteristics. We used quantitative diagnostic methods to reassess and refine estimates of diarrhoea aetiology from the Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) cohort study.
METHODS: We re-analysed stool specimens from the multisite MAL-ED cohort study of children aged 0-2 years done at eight locations (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Vellore, India; Bhaktapur, Nepal; Naushero Feroze, Pakistan; Venda, South Africa; Haydom, Tanzania; Fortaleza, Brazil; and Loreto, Peru), which included active surveillance for diarrhoea and routine non-diarrhoeal stool collection. We used quantitative PCR to test for 29 enteropathogens, calculated population-level pathogen-specific attributable burdens, derived stringent quantitative cutoffs to identify aetiology for individual episodes, and created aetiology prediction scores using clinical characteristics.
FINDINGS: We analysed 6625 diarrhoeal and 30 968 non-diarrhoeal surveillance stools from 1715 children. Overall, 64·9% of diarrhoea episodes (95% CI 62·6-71·2) could be attributed to an aetiology by quantitative PCR compared with 32·8% (30·8-38·7) using the original study microbiology. Viral diarrhoea (36·4% of overall incidence, 95% CI 33·6-39·5) was more common than bacterial (25·0%, 23·4-28·4) and parasitic diarrhoea (3·5%, 3·0-5·2). Ten pathogens accounted for 95·7% of attributable diarrhoea: Shigella (26·1 attributable episodes per 100 child-years, 95% CI 23·8-29·9), sapovirus (22·8, 18·9-27·5), rotavirus (20·7, 18·8-23·0), adenovirus 40/41 (19·0, 16·8-23·0), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (18·8, 16·5-23·8), norovirus (15·4, 13·5-20·1), astrovirus (15·0, 12·0-19·5), Campylobacter jejuni or C coli (12·1, 8·5-17·2), Cryptosporidium (5·8, 4·3-8·3), and typical enteropathogenic E coli (5·4, 2·8-9·3). 86·2% of the attributable incidence for Shigella was non-dysenteric. A prediction score for shigellosis was more accurate (sensitivity 50·4% [95% CI 46·7-54·1], specificity 84·0% [83·0-84·9]) than current guidelines, which recommend treatment only of bloody diarrhoea to cover Shigella (sensitivity 14·5% [95% CI 12·1-17·3], specificity 96·5% [96·0-97·0]).
INTERPRETATION: Quantitative molecular diagnostics improved estimates of pathogen-specific burdens of childhood diarrhoea in the community setting. Viral causes predominated, including a substantial burden of sapovirus; however, Shigella had the highest overall burden with a high incidence in the second year of life. These data could improve the management of diarrhoea in these low-resource settings.

30266330,Morbidity and mortality due to shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2016.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are bacterial pathogens that are frequently associated with diarrhoeal disease, and are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study 2016 (GBD 2016) is a systematic, scientific effort to quantify the morbidity and mortality due to over 300 causes of death and disability. We aimed to analyse the global burden of shigella and ETEC diarrhoea according to age, sex, geography, and year from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: We modelled shigella and ETEC-related mortality using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling platform that evaluates a wide range of covariates and model types on the basis of vital registration and verbal autopsy data. We used a compartmental meta-regression tool to model the incidence of shigella and ETEC, which enforces an association between incidence, prevalence, and remission on the basis of scientific literature, population representative surveys, and health-care data. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
FINDINGS: Shigella was the second leading cause of diarrhoeal mortality in 2016 among all ages, accounting for 212 438 deaths (95% UI 136 979-326 913) and about 13·2% (9·2-17·4) of all diarrhoea deaths. Shigella was responsible for 63 713 deaths (41 191-93 611) among children younger than 5 years and was frequently associated with diarrhoea across all adult age groups, increasing in elderly people, with broad geographical distribution. ETEC was the eighth leading cause of diarrhoea mortality in 2016 among all age groups, accounting for 51 186 deaths (26 757-83 064) and about 3·2% (1·8-4·7) of diarrhoea deaths. ETEC was responsible for about 4·2% (2·2-6·8) of diarrhoea deaths in children younger than 5 years.
INTERPRETATION: The health burden of bacterial diarrhoeal pathogens is difficult to estimate. Despite existing prevention and treatment options, they remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Additional emphasis by public health officials is needed on a reduction in disease due to shigella and ETEC to reduce disease burden.

30244396,"Constructing and transient expression of a gene cassette containing edible vaccine elements and shigellosis, anthrax and cholera recombinant antigens in tomato.","Shigella dysenteriae causing shigellosis is one of the diseases that threaten the health of human society in the developing countries. In Shigella, IpaD gene is one of the key pathogenic genes causing strong mucosal immune system reactions. Anthrax disease is caused by Bacillus anthracis. PA protective antigen is one of the subunits in anthrax toxin complex responsible for the transfer of other subunits into the cytosol of host cells. The 20 kDa subunit of PA (PA20) has the property of immunogenicity. CTxB or B subunit of Vibrio cholerae toxin (CT) is a non-toxic protein and has the function to transfer toxic subunit into cytosol of the host cells by binding to GM1 receptor. The aim of this study was to fuse PA20, ipaD and CTxB and transform tomato plants by this cassette in order to produce an oral vaccine against shigellosis, anthrax and cholera. CTxB was used for these two antigens as an immune adjuvant. IpaD and PA20 genes were cloned in pBI121 containing the CTxB gene and Extensin signal peptide. In order to evaluate the transient expression of Shigellosis, Anthrax and Cholera antigens, agro-infiltrated tomato tissues were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the gene cassette. Cloning was confirmed by PCR, enzymatic digestion and sequencing techniques. Expression of the antigens was examined by SDS-PAGE, dot blot and ELISA. Maturate green fruits demonstrated the highest expression of the recombinant proteins. The first phase of this study was carried out for cloning and expressing of CtxB, ipaD and PA20 antigens in tomato. In the next phase, we aim to analyze the immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate in laboratory animals.","['Davod J', 'Fatemeh DN', 'Honari H', 'Hosseini R']",2018,45,6,Mol Biol Rep,"Davod J, et al.

30218158,Shigella and Enteroinvasive Escherichia Coli.,"Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) are gram-negative bacteria responsible for bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) in humans, which is characterized by invasion and inflammatory destruction of the human colonic epithelium. Different EIEC and Shigella subgroups rose independently from commensal E. coli through patho-adaptive evolution that included loss of functional genes interfering with the virulence and/or with the intracellular lifestyle of the bacteria, as well as acquisition of genetic elements harboring virulence genes. Among the latter is the large virulence plasmid encoding for a type three secretion system (T3SS), which enables translocation of virulence proteins (effectors) from the bacterium directly into the host cell cytoplasm. These effectors enable the pathogen to subvert epithelial cell functions, promoting its own uptake, replication in the host cytosol, and dissemination to adjacent cells while concomitantly inhibiting pro-inflammatory cell death. Furthermore, T3SS effectors are directly involved in Shigella manipulation of immune cells causing their dysfunction and promoting cell death. In the current chapter, we first describe the evolution of the enteroinvasive pathovars and then summarize the overall knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of these bacteria, with a particular focus on Shigella flexneri. Subversion of host cell functions in the human gut, both epithelial and immune cells, by different virulence factors is especially highlighted.","['Belotserkovsky I', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2018,416,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Belotserkovsky I and Sansonetti PJ.

30142163,Characterization of a serologically atypical Shigella flexneri Z isolated from diarrheal patients in Bangladesh and a proposed serological scheme for Shigella flexneri.,"BACKGROUND: Atypical Shigella flexneri Z variant, that agglutinate with E1037 group factor specific monoclonal antisera against Shigella flexneri IV-I but not with other group or type specific antisera, has continuously being isolated in Bangladesh since 1997. Later this serotype has been reported in Indonesia, China and Argentina. Despite being a provisional serotype, continuous isolation of these strains in diverse geographical regions implicated a great necessity to study the overall characteristics of these strains. Therefore, we extensively characterized S. flexneri Z strains using various phenotypic and molecular tools.
METHOD: Of 3569 S. flexneri isolated between 1997 and 2015, 95 strains were identified as S. flexneri Z using a panel of polyvalent absorbed antisera and monoclonal antisera of S. flexneri (MASF). Of them, randomly selected 65 strains were molecular O-serotyped using multiplex PCR and characterized using different phenotypic and molecular techniques (i.e.biotyping, plasmid profile, virulence marker and PFGE) to determine relationship with other subserotypes of S. flexneri.
RESULTS: All these atypical S. flexneri Z strains were agglutinated with MASF B and IV-I antisera. Concordantly, these strains were positive to opt-gene, responsible for MASF IV-I sero-positive phenotype. However, molecular O-serotyping of all 65 strains could not differentiate between Z and Yb giving similar amplification products (wzx1-5 and opt). Contrarily, MASF based serotypic scheme distinguished among Z and Yb as well as Ya. All these S. flexneri Z showed typical biochemical reaction of S. flexneri, harboured a 140 MDa virulence plasmid and virulence markers namely ipaH, ial, sen, sigA and sepA genes. Along with the virulence plasmid, small plasmids (2.6, 1.8 and 1.6 MDa) were present as core plasmid. Moreover, a middle ranged plasmid and a 4.0 MDa sized plasmid were observed in 65% and 20% strains, respectively. Analysis of PFGE on XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA of Bangladeshi strains showed that S. flexneri Z had a close relatedness with Ya and Yb but completely different than the strains of Xa, Xb, 2a and 2b. This observation was found to be unequivocal while the overall result of biotyping, plasmid profile, and virulence factors was compared. Therefore, we conclude that these atypical serotype Z isolated in Bangladesh had a clonal relationship with Ya and Yb of Bangladesh and the opt gene played an important role in serotypic switching among them. Current serotyping scheme of S. flexneri strains fails to place many such atypical strains (1c, 1c+6, 1d, type 4, and 4c) including S. flexneri Z isolated from different parts of the world. Therefore, an updated serotyping scheme for identification of subserotypes of S. flexneri has been proposed to avoid multiple naming of the same subserotype having similar agglutination pattern.","['Shahnaij M', 'Latif HA', 'Azmi IJ', 'Amin MB', 'Luna SJ', 'Islam MA', 'Talukder KA']",2018,13,8,PLoS One,"Shahnaij M, et al.

30075254,Distribution and characterization of Shiga toxin converting temperate phages carried by Shigella flexneri in Hispaniola.,"Shigella infections account for a considerable burden of acute diarrheal diseases worldwide and remain a major cause of childhood mortality in developing countries. Although, all four species of Shigella (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei) cause bacillary dysentery, historically only S. dysenteriae type 1 has been recognized as carrying the genes for Shiga toxin (stx). Recent epidemiological data, however, have suggested that the emergence of stx carrying S. flexneri strains may have originated from bacteriophage-mediated inter-species horizontal gene transfer in one specific geographical area, Hispaniola. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whole genome sequences of stx-encoding phages carried by S. flexneri strains isolated in Haiti and S. flexneri S. boydii and S. dysenteriae strains isolated from international travelers who likely acquired the infection in Haiti or the Dominican Republic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that phage sequences encoded in the Shigella strains from Hispaniola were bacteriophage φPOC-J13 and they were all closely related to a phage isolated from a USA isolate, E. coli 2009C-3133 serotype O119:H4. In addition, despite the low genetic heterogeneity of phages from different Shigella spp. circulating in the Caribbean island between 2001 and 2014, two distinct clusters emerged in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Each cluster possibly originated from phages isolated from S. flexneri 2a, and within each cluster several instances of horizontal phage transfer from S. flexneri 2a to other species were detected. The implications of the emergence of stx-producing non-S. dysenteriae type 1 Shigella species, such as S. flexneri, spans not only the basic science behind horizontal phage spread, but also extends to medical treatment of patients infected with this pathogen.","['Fogolari M', 'Mavian C', 'Angeletti S', 'Salemi M', 'Lampel KA', 'Maurelli AT']",2018,65,,Infect Genet Evol,"Fogolari M, et al.

Here, we present the complete genome of the clinical multidrug resistant (MDR) strain 866, which is highly susceptible to bacteriophage infections. The strain has a circular chromosome of 4.85 Mb and carries a 113 kb MDR plasmid. This IncB/O/K/Z-type plasmid, termed p866, confers resistance to five different classes of antibiotics including ß-lactamase, sulfonamide, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and trimethoprim. Comparative analysis of the plasmid architecture and gene inventory revealed that p866 shares its plasmid backbone with previously described IncB/O/K/Z-type Shigella spp. and Escherichia coli plasmids, but is differentiated by the insertion of antibiotic resistance cassettes, which we found associated with mobile genetic elements such as Tn3, Tn7, and Tn10.

30048255,Recent insights into Shigella.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diarrhoea is a major global health problem, and recent studies have confirmed Shigella as a major contributor to this burden. Here, we review recent advances in Shigella research; focusing on their epidemiology, pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and the role of the gut microbiome during infection.
RECENT FINDINGS: Enhanced epidemiological data, combined with new generation diagnostics, has highlighted a greater burden of Shigella disease than was previously estimated, which is not restricted to vulnerable populations in low-middle income countries. As we gain an ever more detailed insight into the orchestrated mechanisms that Shigella exploit to trigger infection, we can also begin to appreciate the complex role of the gut microbiome in preventing and inducing such infections. The use of genomics, in combination with epidemiological data and laboratory investigations, has unravelled the evolution and spread of various species. Such measures have identified resistance to antimicrobials as a key contributor to the success of specific clones.
SUMMARY: We need to apply novel findings towards sustainable approaches for treating and preventing Shigella infections. Vaccines and alternative treatments are under development and may offer an opportunity to reduce the burden of Shigella disease and restrict the mobility of antimicrobial resistant clones.","['Baker S', 'The HC']",2018,31,5,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Baker S and The HC.

30045699,"Prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of Shigella and Salmonella among children aged below five years with Diarrhoea attending Nigist Eleni Mohammed memorial hospital, South Ethiopia.","BACKGROUND: Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death among children aged below 5 years. Even though, both preventable and treatable diseases, globally there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrhoeal disease and responsible for killing around 525,000 children every year. Shigella and Salmonella species were the leading cause of etiologic agents for diarrhoea associated deaths. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of Shigella and Salmonella isolated from children aged below 5 years with diarrhoea attending Nigist Eleni Mohammed Memorial Hospital, Hossana, South Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from June 02 to September 24, 2017. Two hundred four children aged below 5 years with diarrhoea were enrolled consecutively using convenience sampling technique. Stool specimens were processed in accordance with the standard bacteriological methods and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates was determined using disc diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.
RESULTS: Out of the 204 children aged below 5 years with diarrhoeal disease 19/204 (9.3%, [95%CI, 5.7-13.7%]) of them were positive for bacterial growth, of which 17/204(8.3%) were Shigella species and 2/204(1%) were Salmonella species. Both Shigella and Salmonella isolates were 100% susceptible to norfloxacin, nalidixic acid and kanamycin. However, isolates of Shigella showed 100, 76.5 and 64.7% resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin and cotrimoxazole respectively while Salmonella species were highly resistant to ampicillin and gentamicin (100% each).
CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella and Shigella species is prevalent in the current study area. Among the tested antibiotics, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid and kanamycin were found to be most effective for both isolates. Both species are developing resistance to the commonly prescribed antibiotic. Therefore, culture based bacterial species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing services are strongly recommended to avoid empirical treatment in the study area.","['Abebe W', 'Earsido A', 'Taye S', 'Assefa M', 'Eyasu A', 'Godebo G']",2018,18,1,BMC Pediatr,"Abebe W, et al.

Recent reports state that bone marrow-derived cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) also express TLR proteins. Numerous researches have studied the effect of a number of LPSs on TLR4 expression, but no data exists on the effect of LPSs from different strains of one bacterial genus on TLR4 expression. In this study, we investigate the effects of various concentrations of LPS from different Shigella strains on TLR4 expression in human bone marrow (hBM)-MSCs. At the mRNA level, we have found that untreated hBM-MSCs (control) did not express TLR4 compared to the experimental groups. Cells treated with LPS from Shigella flexneri had the highest expression of TLR4, whereas cells treated with LPS from Shigella sonnei had the lowest expression. We observed that LPSs had a dose-dependent effect on TLR4 expression in all of the treatment groups. ELISA findings for interleukin-6 secretion have confirmed mRNA expression results for all treatment groups. Hence, LPS from S. flexneri can be considered as an optimum LPS to stimulate the immune system for vaccine production against shigellosis. Also, TLR activation in hBM-MSCs can modulate their function such as homing.","['Hashemzadeh MR', 'Eslaminejad MB', 'Salman Yazdi R', 'Aflatoonian R']",2018,55,,Biologicals,"Hashemzadeh MR, et al.

Hence, the objective of this study was to isolate and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Shigella and Salmonella species from children with acute diarrhoea in Mekelle Hospital and Semen Health Center.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among 260 children with acute diarrhoea from November 2011 to March 2012 in Mekelle, Ethiopia. Stool specimen was collected from all study participants who presented with acute diarrhoea. Microscopy, culture and confirmatory identification were done by the pattern of biochemical reactions using a standard bacterial identification system (API 20E, BioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) and polyvalent (Poly O and H) antiseras for Salmonella species and Vi for S.typhi. Isolated colonies were assessed for antimicrobial susceptibility profile using disk diffusion method. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 software.
RESULTS: Out of the 260 study participants, 145(55.8%) were males while 115(44.2%) were females. The majority of the patients (44.2%) were of children under five years old. A total of 120 enteropathogens were isolated. The frequency of isolation was 19(7.3%), 18(6.9%) and 83(31.9%) for Salmonella species, Shigella species and intestinal parasites respectively. Most of the Shigella isolates were resistant to ampicillin (88.9%), Tetracycline (77.8), cotrimoxazole (55.6%) and chloramphenicol (55.6%).

Current culture-independent testing (CIT) methods to identify Shigella in faecal samples rely on the ipaH gene as the target, which is also found in EIEC genomes. The aim of this study was to design an assay that can identify EIEC in cultures from CIT ipaH-positive samples.
METHODOLOGY: Shigella and EIEC genomes were screened to find unique regions present in EIEC genomes using a comparative genomics approach and differentiating genetic loci that are suitable PCR targets were identified. The primers for these loci were designed and tested in 6501 and 104 genomes of Shigella and EIEC, respectively.
RESULTS: An assay with two sets of multiplex PCR reactions that differentiates Shigella and EIEC based on the presence/absence of at least two out of six loci was developed and evaluated. The majority of Shigella genomes lacked all six loci, while at least two loci were present in most EIEC genomes. This assay successfully differentiated clinical EIEC from Shigella with a limit of detection of 10

29964231,Update on vaccines for enteric pathogens.,"BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhoeal disease caused by viral, bacterial and parasitic infections is a major global health problem; in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) it is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity in children under 5. Some of these infections also impact large segments of populations in high-income countries (HICs), as well as individuals who travel overseas for work, business or pleasure.
AIMS: The aim of this review is to describe the current landscape of licensed enteric vaccines, potential new vaccines on the horizon, and the challenges of development and utilization of vaccines against enteric pathogens.
SOURCES: Relevant data from the literature, as well as clinical trials described in European and US registries, were examined in the conduct of this review.
CONTENT: The review involves discussion of current licensed vaccines against rotavirus, cholera and typhoid, as well as potential second- and third-generation vaccines against these pathogens currently in the development pipeline. In addition, novel vaccines against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, shigellosis and norovirus in advanced development are described. Challenges to the development and utilization of global vaccines are discussed.
IMPLICATIONS: Despite advances in population health, food security, improved sanitation and water quality, and the reduction in poverty, acute enteric infections continue to plague global populations. Advancing utilization of current enteric vaccines is of critical public health importance, as is the development of new vaccines, particularly for enteric pathogens where none currently exist.","['Riddle MS', 'Chen WH', 'Kirkwood CD', 'MacLennan CA']",2018,24,10,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Riddle MS, et al.

29960802,Cyclic OmpC peptidic epitope conjugated to tetanus toxoid as a potential vaccine candidate against shigellosis.,"In earlier works we have described that mice immunized with outer membrane protein OmpC survive the challenge with live Shigella flexnerii 3a. We have also identified conformational epitope of this protein, that was recognized by mice antibodies. The aim of current work was to investigate whether synthetic OmpC epitope homologs can elicit immunological response sufficient in protecting mice against shigellosis. Several linear peptides containing RYDERY motif were synthesized and conjugated to poly-lysine. These conjugates appeared to be poor immunogens and to boost the immunological response an addition of the adjuvant (MPL) was required. Unfortunately, the MPL alone caused a very high immunological reaction that was masking response to peptidic epitope. Under those circumstances we used tetanus toxoid (TT) as the carrier protein for the peptides and the agent stimulating immunological response. Series of cyclic peptides, homologs of the OmpC main epitope were synthesized and conjugated to TT. The loop size in cyclic peptides varied by number of glycine residues, i.e., 1-3 residues added to the GLNRYDERYIGK motif. The linear GLNRYDERYIGC-TT was also prepared as the control. The latter conjugate gave the highest immunological response, followed by the cyclic-GGLNRYDERYIGC-TT and cyclic-GLNRYDERYIGC-TT. The third peptide, cyclic-GGGLNRYDERYIGC-TT, gave a very low response, although it was the most resistant to proteolysis. However, antibodies obtained against cyclic-GGLNRYDERYIGC-TT were more potent to recognize both OmpC and Shigella flexnerii 3a cells than the antibodies against linear GLNRYDERYIGC-TT. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibodies raised against linear GLNRYDERYIGC-TT showed 20-fold lower dissociation constant (KD) than the naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies from umbilical cord sera. Monoclonal antibodies also gave a weaker signal in electron microscope than mice and human polyclonal antibodies. In overall, our results point to cyclic peptides as better candidates for a vaccine development, since they are eliciting production of the higher affinity antibodies against Shigella cells and OmpC.","['Jarząb A', 'Witkowska D', 'Ziomek E', 'Setner B', 'Czajkowska A', 'Dorot M', 'Szewczuk Z', 'Gamian A']",2018,36,31,Vaccine,"Jarząb A, et al.

METHODOLOGY: A travel history was provided for 72.7 % (548/754) of cases, of which 90.9 % (498/548) reported travel outside the UK within 7 days of onset of symptoms, and 9.1 % (50/498) reported no travel in that time frame. During the course of this study, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was implemented for GI disease surveillance, and we compared phenotypic AMR profiles with those derived from WGS data (n=133).Results/Key findings. The phenotypic and genotypic AMR results correlated well, with 90.1 % (121/133) isolates having concordant results to 10 classes of antimicrobials. Resistance to the first-line drugs commonly used in the treatment of shigellosis was observed throughout the study (ampicillin, 54.1%; chloramphenicol, 33.7 %; sulphonamides, 76.0 %; trimethoprim, 80.0%). Between 2004 and 2017, resistance to all classes of antimicrobials (except the phenicols) increased. The proportion of isolates exhibiting reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin increased from 3.8 % in 2004 to 75.7 % in 2017, and this was significantly associated with cases reporting travel to Asia compared to Africa (P<0.001). Of the 201 sequenced isolates, 3.0 % (20/201) had either blaCTX-M-15 or blaCMY-4.

METHODS: Diagnostic laboratories are requested to refer all Shigella isolates to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) for epidemiological typing as part of the national surveillance of shigellosis. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 263 non-duplicate Shigella isolates referred to ESR in 2015 and 2016 was tested.
RESULTS: The 263 Shigella comprised 141 (53.6%) S. sonnei, 113 (43.0%) S. flexneri, 7 (2.7%) S. boydii and 2 (0.8%) S. dysenteriae. Among the 141 S. sonnei, the majority were either biotype g (90) or biotype a (50). Rates of resistance to the two currently recommended first-line antibiotics, co-trimoxazole and fluoroquinolones, were relatively high at 56.7% and 22.8%, respectively. Azithromycin is considered a second-line treatment option, but 11.0% of Shigella were categorised as having a non-wildtype (NWT) azithromycin phenotype (ie, having some mechanism of azithromycin resistance although not necessarily clinically resistant). There were several significant differences in resistance between the two most prevalent S. sonnei biotypes, with resistance being significantly more prevalent among biotype g isolates. Shigella from patients who had not travelled overseas were significantly more likely to be azithromycin NWT than isolates from patients who had recently travelled (20.7 vs 5.6%). Azithromycin NWT was more prevalent among Shigella from males than females (13.9 vs 7.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest there is an immediate need to revise the currently recommended first-line treatment for shigellosis, especially when treatment is given on an empirical basis. Equally concerning is the fact that resistance to the second-line antibiotic for shigellosis, azithromycin, appears to be emerging in New Zealand. As diagnostic laboratories increase their use of culture-independent testing, it is recommended that they should continue to culture specimens from all shigellosis cases so that isolates are available for susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.","['Heffernan H', 'Woodhouse R', 'Hewison C', 'Sherwood J']",2018,131,1477,N Z Med J,"Heffernan H, et al.

29927109,Shigella Pathogenesis Modeling with Tissue Culture Assays.,"Shigella is an enteroinvasive human pathogen that infects the colonic epithelium and causes Shigellosis, an infectious diarrheal disease. There is no vaccine for the prevention or treatment of Shigellosis and antibiotic-resistant strains of Shigella are increasing, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of Shigella pathogenesis in order to design effective antimicrobial therapies. Small animal models do not recapitulate Shigellosis, therefore tissue-cultured cells have served as model systems to study Shigella pathogenesis. Here, protocols to enumerate Shigella invasion, cell-cell spread, and plaque formation in the tissue-cultured cell lines Henle-407 and CoN-841 are described. Additionally, a new method to study Shigella invasion in primary intestinal enteroids is described. These protocols can be used to examine different aspects of Shigella virulence. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","['Koestler BJ', 'Ward CM', 'Payne SM']",2018,50,1,Curr Protoc Microbiol,"Koestler BJ, et al.

29906636,Antimicrobial sensitivity trends and virulence genes in Shigella spp. from the Oceania region.,"Shigella is a common cause of diarrhoea in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and other Oceania countries. However, little is known about the strains causing infection. Archived Shigella isolates (n = 72) were obtained from research laboratories in PNG and reference laboratories in Australia. Shigella virulence genes were detected by PCR, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion. The ipaH virulence gene was present in all 72 isolates. The prevalence of other virulence genes was variable, with ial, invE, ipaBCD, sen/ospD3 and virF present in 60% of isolates and set1A and set1B genes present in 42% of isolates. Most S. flexneri isolates contained genes encoding enterotoxin 1 and/or enterotoxin 2. Resistance to antibiotics was common, with 51/72 isolates resistant to 2-4 antimicrobials. A greater proportion of bacteria isolated since 2010 (relative to pre-2010 isolates) were resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; suggesting that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Shigella is increasing over time in the Oceania region. There is a need for improved knowledge regarding Shigella circulation in the Oceania region and further monitoring of AMR patterns.","['Malau E', 'Ford R', 'Valcanis M', 'Jennison AV', 'Mosse J', 'Bean D', 'Yoannes M', 'Pomat W', 'Horwood PF', 'Greenhill AR']",2018,64,,Infect Genet Evol,"Malau E, et al.

29880081,Prediction of Shigellosis outcomes in Israel using machine learning classifiers.,"Shigellosis causes significant morbidity and mortality in developing and developed countries, mostly among infants and young children. The World Health Organization estimates that more than one million people die from Shigellosis every year. In order to evaluate trends in Shigellosis in Israel in the years 2002-2015, we analysed national notifiable disease reporting data. Shigella sonnei was the most commonly identified Shigella species in Israel. Hospitalisation rates due to Shigella flexenri were higher in comparison with other Shigella species. Shigella morbidity was higher among infants and young children (age 0-5 years old). Incidence of Shigella species differed among various ethnic groups, with significantly high rates of S. flexenri among Muslims, in comparison with Jews, Druze and Christians. In order to improve the current Shigellosis clinical diagnosis, we developed machine learning algorithms to predict the Shigella species and whether a patient will be hospitalised or not, based on available demographic and clinical data. The algorithms' performances yielded an accuracy of 93.2% (Shigella species) and 94.9% (hospitalisation) and may consequently improve the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.","['Adamker G', 'Holzer T', 'Karakis I', 'Amitay M', 'Anis E', 'Singer SR', 'Barnett-Itzhaki Z']",2018,146,11,Epidemiol Infect,"Adamker G, et al.

29858013,Human Enteric α-Defensin 5 Promotes Shigella Infection by Enhancing Bacterial Adhesion and Invasion.,"Shigella is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery worldwide. It invades the intestinal epithelium to elicit intense inflammation and tissue damage, yet the underlying mechanisms of its host selectivity and low infectious inoculum remain perplexing. Here, we report that Shigella co-opts human α-defensin 5 (HD5), a host defense peptide important for intestinal homeostasis and innate immunity, to enhance its adhesion to and invasion of mucosal tissues. HD5 promoted Shigella infection in vitro in a structure-dependent manner. Shigella, commonly devoid of an effective host-adhesion apparatus, preferentially targeted HD5 to augment its ability to colonize the intestinal epithelium through interactions with multiple bacterial membrane proteins. HD5 exacerbated infectivity and Shigella-induced pathology in a culture of human colorectal tissues and three animal models. Our findings illuminate how Shigella exploits innate immunity by turning HD5 into a virulence factor for infection, unveiling a mechanism of action for this highly proficient human pathogen.","['Xu D', 'Liao C', 'Zhang B', 'Tolbert WD', 'He W', 'Dai Z', 'Zhang W', 'Yuan W', 'Pazgier M', 'Liu J', 'Yu J', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Bevins CL', 'Shao Y', 'Lu W']",2018,48,6,Immunity,"Xu D, et al.

29770078,Evaluating the timeliness of reporting in a First Nations communicable diseases program.,"BACKGROUND: Timely reporting of communicable diseases is necessary to enable a prompt response to mitigate and control outbreaks. This is especially true among First Nations communities due to a number of factors, including unique social determinants of health, which can contribute to rapid disease transmission.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the timeliness of reporting for 12 notifiable communicable diseases in the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority, which includes 33 First Nations on-reserve communities in Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, and to assess whether there were differences in reporting times depending on degree of remoteness of community, season or year.
METHODS: Data for four sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and eight other communicable diseases were abstracted from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) between 2008 and 2013 and compared against the targets set for reporting in the Saskatchewan Communicable Disease Control Manual. The reporting time was defined as the duration from client exposure or presentation at clinic to the case notification day at Saskatchewan's Ministry of Health. Communicable diseases were evaluated for proportion of cases reported within recommended time, and mean reporting time. Geographical and reporting data were also recorded to assess variations in reporting time among different northern communities and according to season or year.
RESULTS: A total of 9,767 records were identified for the 12 diseases; all had a 14-day recommended reporting time, with the exception of shigellosis, which had a three-day reporting time. Overall, 93.6% of the diseases were reported in the recommended reporting time, although there was variability among the diseases. All four of the STIs (chlamydia, gonococcal infections, HIV and syphilis) had over 90% of cases reported within the 14-day recommended time period. Other communicable diseases reporting times varied from a high of 93.4% for methicillin-resistant 
CONCLUSION: Overall, communicable disease reporting in this northern health authority program met recommended reporting times, although there were variations according to the disease, the area reporting and the year. Further research is needed to understand these variations in order to inform efforts to strengthen communicable disease surveillance among First Nations communities.","['Lam A', 'Woods S', 'Ndubuka N']",2017,43,6,Can Commun Dis Rep,"Lam A, et al.

29746835,Complement C3 Drives Autophagy-Dependent Restriction of Cyto-invasive Bacteria.,"In physiological settings, the complement protein C3 is deposited on all bacteria, including invasive pathogens. However, because experimental host-bacteria systems typically use decomplemented serum to avoid the lytic action of complement, the impact of C3 coating on epithelial cell responses to invasive bacteria remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that following invasion, intracellular C3-positive Listeria monocytogenes is targeted by autophagy through a direct C3/ATG16L1 interaction, resulting in autophagy-dependent bacterial growth restriction. In contrast, Shigella flexneri and Salmonella Typhimurium escape autophagy-mediated growth restriction in part through the action of bacterial outer membrane proteases that cleave bound C3. Upon oral infection with Listeria, C3-deficient mice displayed defective clearance at the intestinal mucosa. Together, these results demonstrate an intracellular role of complement in triggering antibacterial autophagy and immunity against intracellular pathogens. Since C3 indiscriminately associates with foreign surfaces, the C3-ATG16L1 interaction may provide a universal mechanism of xenophagy initiation.","['Sorbara MT', 'Foerster EG', 'Tsalikis J', 'Abdel-Nour M', 'Mangiapane J', 'Sirluck-Schroeder I', 'Tattoli I', 'van Dalen R', 'Isenman DE', 'Rohde JR', 'Girardin SE', 'Philpott DJ']",2018,23,5,Cell Host Microbe,"Sorbara MT, et al.

29743642,Genomic epidemiology of Shigella in the United Kingdom shows transmission of pathogen sublineages and determinants of antimicrobial resistance.,"Shigella are globally important diarrhoeal pathogens that are endemic in low-to-middle income nations and also occur in high income nations, typically in travellers or community-based risk-groups. Shigella phylogenetics reveals population structures that are more reliable than those built with traditional typing methods, and has identified sublineages associated with specific geographical regions or patient groups. Genomic analyses reveal temporal increases in Shigella antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene content, which is frequently encoded on mobile genetic elements. Here, we whole genome sequenced representative subsamples of S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei (n = 366) from the United Kingdom from 2008 to 2014, and analysed these alongside publicly available data to make qualitative insights on the genomic epidemiology of shigellosis and its AMR within the broader global context. Combined phylogenetic, epidemiological and genomic anlayses revealed the presence of domestically-circulating sublineages in patient risk-groups and the importation of travel-related sublineages from both Africa and Asia, including ciprofloxacin-resistant sublineages of both species from Asia. Genomic analyses revealed common AMR determinants among travel-related and domestically-acquired isolates, and the evolution of mutations associated with reduced quinolone susceptibility in domestically-circulating sublineages. Collectively, this study provides unprecedented insights on the contribution and mobility of endemic and travel-imported sublineages and AMR determinants responsible for disease in a high-income nation.","['Baker KS', 'Dallman TJ', 'Field N', 'Childs T', 'Mitchell H', 'Day M', 'Weill FX', 'Lefèvre S', 'Tourdjman M', 'Hughes G', 'Jenkins C', 'Thomson N']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,"Baker KS, et al.

A total of 158 isolates were isolated from the stool samples of 1,026 children with diarrhoea aged 14 years old between May 2012 and October 2015 in Henan. The K‑B method was applied for the determination of drug resistance of Shigella flexneri, and polymerase chain reaction amplification was used for class 1, 2 and 3 integrase genes. Enzyme digestion and sequence analysis were performed for the variable regions of positive strains. Based on the drug sensitivity assessment, multi‑drug resistant strains that were resistant to five or more antibiotics, and sensitive strains were selected for amplification. Their active efflux pump genes, acrA and acrB, and regulatory genes, marOR, acrR and soxS, were selected for sequencing. The results revealed that 91.1% of the 158 strains were multi‑resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and 69.6% of the strains were multi‑resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was <32.9%. All strains (100%) were sensitive to cefoxitin, cefoperazone/sulbactam and imipenem. The rate of the class 1 integron positivity was 91.9% (144/158). Among these class 1 integron‑positive strains, 18 strains exhibited the resistance gene cassette dfrV in the variable region of the strain, four strains exhibited dfrA17‑aadA5 in the variable region and 140 strains exhibited blaOXA‑30‑aadA1 in the variable region. Four strains showed no resistance gene in the variable regions. The rate of class 2 integron positivity was 86.1% (136/158), and all positive strains harboured the dfrA1‑sat1‑aadA resistance gene cassette in the variable region. The class 3 integrase gene was not detected in these strains. The gene sequencing showed the deletion of base CATT in the 36, 37, 38, 39 site in the marOR gene, which is a regulatory gene of the active efflux pump, AcrAB‑TolC.

29655379,Shigella infection in children under 5 years old in western French Guiana.,"French Guiana, a tropical country, is characterised by a young and multi-ethnic population. Difficulties in accessing safe water sources lead to outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the microbiological profile of shigella strains isolated in western French Guiana, including antimicrobial susceptibility and the distribution of strains in terms of species and serotypes and (2) to estimate the incidence of shigellosis in children under 5 years old. A retrospective observational study was conducted of 213 cases of shigellosis diagnosed in the biology department of the hospital centre for western French Guiana between 2000 and 2012 in children under 5 years old. The serogroups (formerly known as species) that predominates in French Guiana was Shigella flexneri. No resistance was observed to fluoroquinolones or to third-generation cephalosporins. The average incidence of shigellosis in children under 5 years old in western French Guiana was estimated at 189.6 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year. Shigellosis is a public health problem in western French Guiana. These infections suggest the difficulties in accessing safe water sources and the lack of public sanitation. A quadrivalent vaccine containing Shigella sonnei and three serotypes of S. flexneri (S. flexneri 2a, 3a and 6) could provide broad coverage against shigella infections.","['Parisot M', 'Parez N', 'Boukhari R', 'Breurec S', 'Jolivet A']",2018,146,8,Epidemiol Infect,"Parisot M, et al.

29654279,Horizontal antimicrobial resistance transfer drives epidemics of multiple Shigella species.,"Horizontal gene transfer has played a role in developing the global public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, the dynamics of AMR transfer through bacterial populations and its direct impact on human disease is poorly elucidated. Here, we study parallel epidemic emergences of multiple Shigella species, a priority AMR organism, in men who have sex with men to gain insight into AMR emergence and spread. Using genomic epidemiology, we show that repeated horizontal transfer of a single AMR plasmid among Shigella enhanced existing and facilitated new epidemics. These epidemic patterns contrasted with slighter, slower increases in disease caused by organisms with vertically inherited (chromosomally encoded) AMR. This demonstrates that horizontal transfer of AMR directly affects epidemiological outcomes of globally important AMR pathogens and highlights the need for integration of genomic analyses into all areas of AMR research, surveillance and management.","['Baker KS', 'Dallman TJ', 'Field N', 'Childs T', 'Mitchell H', 'Day M', 'Weill FX', 'Lefèvre S', 'Tourdjman M', 'Hughes G', 'Jenkins C', 'Thomson N']",2018,9,1,Nat Commun,"Baker KS, et al.

29637750,Genotypic Diversity of Multidrug Resistant Shigella species from Iran.,"BACKGROUND: In many developing countries, shigellosis is endemic and also occurs in epidemics and treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates are important. The aims of this study were to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, prevalence of class 1 and 2 integrons and the clonal relatedness of isolates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by disc diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequencing technique was employed for detection and characterization of integrons. The genetic relatedness was evaluated by using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR.
RESULTS: There was a high percentage of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (93.7%), ampicillin (AMP) (87.3%), streptomycin (STR) (84.5%) and tetracycline (TET) (78.9%). Multidrug resistant phenotype was seen in 95.1% of total isolates. Most common MDR profile was TMP/SMX/STR/AMP resistant pattern. Among the 142 Shigella spp. analyzed in this study, 28 isolates were positive for class 1 integron with two types of gene cassette arrays (dfrA17/aadA5 = 31.7% and dfrA7 = 3.8%). The class 2 integron was more frequently detected among the isolates (94.7%) with dfrA1/sat1/aadA1 (69.4%) and dfrA1/sat1 (30.6%) gene cassettes. ERIC-PCR results showed 6, 5, 4 and 3 main genotypes among S. flexneri, S. sonnei, S. boydii and S. dysenteriae isolates, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that multidrug resistant Shigella species with high prevalence of class 2 integron were very common in Iran. In addition, ERIC-PCR patterns showed limited variety of clones are responsible for shigellosis in the region of the study.","['Zamanlou S', 'Rezaee MA', 'Aghazadeh M', 'Ghotaslou R', 'Nave HH', 'Khalili Y']",2018,50,1,Infect Chemother,"Zamanlou S, et al.

29595412,Out of Asia: the independent rise and global spread of fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella.,"Shigella are ranked among the most prevalent aetiologies of diarrhoeal disease worldwide, disproportionately affecting young children in developing countries and high-risk communities in developed settings. Antimicrobial treatment, most commonly with fluoroquinolones, is currently recommended for Shigella infections to alleviate symptoms and control disease transmission. Resistance to fluoroquinolones has emerged in differing Shigella species (S. dysenteriae, flexneri and sonnei) since the turn of the 21st century, originating in endemic areas, and latterly spreading into non-endemic regions. Despite occurring independently, the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in these different Shigella species shares striking similarities regarding their epidemiology and resistance mechanisms. Here, we review and discuss the current epidemiology of fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella species, particularly in the light of recent genomic insights.","['Chung The H', 'Baker S']",2018,4,4,Microb Genom,Chung The H and Baker S.

29590182,Clinical endpoints in the controlled human challenge model for Shigella: A call for standardization and the development of a disease severity score.,"BACKGROUND: Since 1946 the controlled human infection model (CHIM) for Shigella has been used to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis, describe clinical and immunologic responses to infection and as a tool for vaccine development. As the frequency and intent for use in vaccine comparisons increases, standardization of the primary endpoint definition is necessary.
METHODS: Subject-level data were obtained from previously conducted experimental Shigella CHIM studies. Signs and symptoms severity were categorized consistently across all studies. Sign and symptom correlations were estimated and univariate models were utilized to describe the association between stool output and other Shigella-attributable signs and symptoms. Multiple correspondence and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed to describe the co-occurrence of signs and symptoms. A disease score is proposed based on the co-occurrence of these events.
RESULTS: Data were obtained on 54 subjects receiving 800 to 2000 colony forming units (cfu) of S. flexneri. The median maximum 24 hour stool output was 514 ml (IQR: 300, 998 ml) with a median frequency of 6 (IQR: 4, 9). Subjects reported abdominal pain or cramps (81.5%), headache (66.7%) and anorexia (64.8%), 50.0% had a fever and 27.8% had gross blood in multiple loose stools. Multiple correspondence analyses highlighted co-occurrence of symptoms based on severity. A 3-parameter disease severity score predicted shigellosis endpoints and better differentiated disease spectrum.
CONCLUSION: Dichotomous endpoints for Shigella CHIM fail to fully account for disease variability. An ordinal disease score characterizing the breadth of disease severity may enable a better characterization of shigellosis and can decrease sample size requirements. Furthermore, the disease severity score may be a useful tool for portfolio management by enabling prioritization across vaccine candidates with comparable efficacy estimates using dichotomous endpoints.","['Porter CK', 'Lynen A', 'Riddle MS', 'Talaat K', 'Sack D', 'Gutiérrez RL', 'McKenzie R', 'DeNearing B', 'Feijoo B', 'Kaminski RW', 'Taylor DN', 'Kirkpatrick BD', 'Bourgeois AL']",2018,13,3,PLoS One,"Porter CK, et al.

METHODS: A literature survey was conducted via SciFinder, ScieneDirect, PubMed, Springer, and Wiley databases. A total of 139 selected references were classified on the basis of their research scopes, including chemical investigation, quality evaluation and pharmacological studies.
RESULTS: Many types of secondary metabolites including alkaloids, lignans, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, saccharides, and steroids have been isolated from CR. Among them, protoberberine-type alkaloids, such as berberine, palmatine, coptisine, epiberberine, jatrorrhizine, columamine, are the main components of CR. Quantitative determination of these alkaloids is a very important aspect in the quality evaluation of CR. In recent years, with the advances in isolation and detection technologies, many new instruments and methods have been developed for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the main alkaloids from CR. The quality control of CR has provided safety for pharmacological applications. These quality evaluation methods are also frequently employed to screen the active components from CR.

29494623,The effects of socioecological factors on variation of communicable diseases: A multiple-disease study at the national scale of Vietnam.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of socioecological factors on multiple communicable diseases across Vietnam.
METHODS: We used the Moran's I tests to evaluate spatial clusters of diseases and applied multilevel negative binomial regression models using the Bayesian framework to analyse the association between socioecological factors and the diseases queried by oral, airborne, vector-borne, and animal transmission diseases.
RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The study found that oral-transmission diseases were spatially distributed across the country; whereas, the airborne-transmission diseases were more clustered in the Northwest and vector-borne transmission diseases were more clustered in the South. Most of diseases were sensitive with climatic factors. For instance, a 1°C increase in average temperature is significantly associated with 0.4% (95CI, 0.3-0.5), 2.5% (95%CI, 1.4-3.6), 0.9% (95%CI, 0.6-1.4), 1.1% (95%CI), 5% (95%CI, 3-.7.4), 0.4% (95%CI, 0.2-0.7), and 2% (95%CI, 1.5-2.8) increase in risk of diarrhoea, shigellosis, mumps, influenza, dengue, malaria, and rabies respectively. The influences of socio-economic factors on risk of communicable diseases are varied by factors with the biggest influence of population density. The research findings reflect an important implication for the climate change adaptation strategies of health sectors. A development of weather-based early warning systems should be considered to strengthen communicable disease prevention in Vietnam.","['Phung D', 'Nguyen HX', 'Nguyen HLT', 'Luong AM', 'Do CM', 'Tran QD', 'Chu C']",2018,13,3,PLoS One,"Phung D, et al.

29489863,In vivo screening platform for shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model.,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are the main cause of bacillary dysentery, although STEC strains generally induce milder disease symptoms compared to Shigella species. This study aimed to determine the virulence of STEC using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model host. Worm killing, fertility and bacterial colonisation assays were performed to examine the potential difference in the virulence of STEC strains compared to that of the control E. coli OP50 strains on which worms were fed. A statistically significant difference in the survival rates of C. elegans was observed in that the STEC strains caused death in 8-10 days and the E. coli OP50 strains caused death in 15 days. STEC strains severely reduced the fertility of the worms. The intestinal load of bacteria in the adult stage nematodes harbouring the E. coli OP50 strains was found to be 3.5 log CFU mL-1. In contrast, the STEC strains E15, E18 and E22 harboured 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7 log CFU ml-1 per nematode, respectively. The heat-killed STEC strains significantly increased the longevity of the worms compared to the non-heated STEC strains. In addition, PCR-based genomic profiling of shiga toxin genes, viz., stx1 and stx2, identified in selected STEC strains revealed that these toxins may be associated with the virulence of the STEC strains. This study demonstrated that C. elegans is an effective model to examine and compare the pathogenicity and virulence variation of STEC strains to that of E. coli OP50 strains.","['Hwang SB', 'Choi JG', 'Wei S', 'Park BJ', 'Chelliah R', 'Oh DH']",2018,13,2,PLoS One,"Hwang SB, et al.

29488864,Identification of interactions among host and bacterial proteins and evaluation of their role early during Shigella flexneri infection.,"Shigella species cause diarrhoea by invading and spreading through the epithelial layer of the human colon. The infection triggers innate immune responses in the host that the bacterium combats by translocating into the host cell cytosol via a type 3 secretion system bacterial effector proteins that interfere with host processes. We previously demonstrated that interaction of the Shigella type 3 secreted effector protein IcsB with the host protein Toca-1 inhibits the innate immune response microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis, and that IcsB interaction with Toca-1 is required for inhibition of this host response. Here, we show that Toca-1 in vitro precipitated not only IcsB, but also the type 3 secreted proteins OspC3, IpgD and IpaB. OspC3 and IpgD precipitation with Toca-1 was dependent on IcsB. Early during infection, most of these proteins localized near intracellular Shigella. We examined whether interactions among these proteins restrict innate host cell responses other than LC3-associated phagocytosis. In infected cells, OspC3 blocks production and secretion of the mature pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18; however, we found that interaction of OspC3 with IcsB, either directly or indirectly via Toca-1, was not required for OspC3-mediated restriction of IL-18 production. These results indicate that interactions of the host protein Toca-1 with a subset of type 3 effector proteins contribute to the established function of some, but not all involved, effector proteins.","['Miller KA', 'Garza-Mayers AC', 'Leung Y', 'Goldberg MB']",2018,164,4,Microbiology (Reading),"Miller KA, et al.

All isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the disc diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect different molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Serotyping was performed using specific antisera. The clonal relationship of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Of the 67 shigella isolates analysed, 59 were diarrhoeal cases and eight were controls. S. flexneri (70.1%; 47/67) was the most common species, followed by S. sonnei (23.9%; 16/67). The most prevalent S. flexneri serotypes were 2a (38.3%; 18/47), 6 (19.2%; 9/47) and 1b (14.9%; 7/47). High rates of antimicrobial resistance were observed for trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole (92.5%; 62/67), tetracycline (68.7%; 46/67), chloramphenicol (53.7%; 36/67) and ampicillin (50.7%; 34/67). Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was present in 55.2% (37/67) of the isolates and was associated with a case fatality rate of 8.1% (3/37). PFGE revealed 22 clones (16 S. flexneri and 6 S. sonnei), among which P1 (31.9%; 15/47), P9 (17%; 8/47) and P2 (10.6%; 5/47) were the most prevalent clones of S. flexneri. In conclusion, S. flexneri was the most prevalent species, with MDR isolates mainly belonging to three specific clones (P1, P9 and P2).

29415691,"Disparities in severe shigellosis among adults - Foodborne diseases active surveillance network, 2002-2014.","BACKGROUND: Shigella causes approximately 500,000 illnesses, 6000 hospitalizations, and 40 deaths in the United States annually, but incidence and populations at risk for severe shigellosis among adults are unclear. This study describes severe shigellosis among US adults.
METHODS: We analyzed Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network data for infections caused by Shigella among adults ≥18 years old during 2002-2014. Criteria to define severe shigellosis included hospitalization, bacteremia, or death. We estimated annual incidence of shigellosis per 100,000 among adult populations, and conducted multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression to assess associations between severe shigellosis, demographic factors and Shigella species among adults with shigellosis.
RESULTS: Among 9968 shigellosis cases, 2764 (28%) were severe. Restricting to cases due to S. sonnei and S. flexneri, median annual incidence of severe shigellosis among adults was 0.56 and highest overall incidence was among black males 18-49 years old (1.58). Among adults with shigellosis, odds of severe disease were higher among males than females aged 18-49 years old (OR [95% CI] = 1.32 [1.15-1.52], p < 0.001) and among males than females with S. flexneri infections (OR [95% CI] =1.39 [1.10-1.75], p = 0.005). The odds of severe shigellosis were higher among blacks than whites (OR [95% CI] = 1.36 [1.22-1.52], p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among adults, men 18-49 years old, particularly blacks, have the highest incidence of severe shigellosis. Among adults with shigellosis, severe shigellosis was associated with being male in age group 18-49 years, with infections caused by S. flexneri, and with black race. Future research should assess associations between severe shigellosis and sexual practices, antimicrobial resistance, comorbidities, and access to care.","['McCrickard LS', 'Crim SM', 'Kim S', 'Bowen A']",2018,18,1,BMC Public Health,"McCrickard LS, et al.

Salmonella and Shigella specious are the major enteric pathogen causing diarrhea among children worldwide. Examination of stool sample is the most sensitive method to diagnose diarrheal disease in children. This study aimed to determining the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and associated factor of Salmonella and Shigella infection among under five children.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted on under 5 years children attending Arba Minch town. Pre-tested and structured questionnaire was used for collecting data about socio-demographic characteristics and associated factors. Stool sample was used to isolate and identified the pathogen. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for isolated Salmonella and Shigella specious. A logistic regression analysis was used to see the association between different variables and outcome variable. Odds ratio with 95% CI was computed to determine the presence and strength of the association.
RESULTS: A total of 167 under five children were included in the study. About 57% of participants were males with the mean age of 32 months. The overall prevalence of Salmonella and Shigella species infection was 17.45% with 12.6% Salmonella species. The isolates were resistant to common antibiotics such as Amoxicillin, Erythromycin, Chloramphenicol, Clindamycin, Norfloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Cotrimoxazole, and Gentamycin. Urban resident [AOR = 7.11; 95% CI (2.3, 22.2)], month income < 1000 Ethiopian birr [AOR = 6.5; 95% CI (2.0, 21.4)], absence of waste disposal system [AOR = 3.3; 95% CI (1.2, 9.3)], poor hand washing habit [AOR = 6.0; 95% CI (2.0, 18.2)], untrimmed finger nail [AOR = 3.7; 95% CI (1.4, 10.6)], and use of napkin [AOR = 3.2; 95% CI (1.1, 9.3)] had significant association with Salmonella and Shigella infection.
CONCLUSION: Salmonella and Shigella species infections were higher as compared the national prevalence. This study also revealed that the enteric infection were significantly associated with finger nail status, residence, hand washing practice, month income of parents, usage of napkin after toilet, and absence of waste disposal system. Therefore, working on identified associated factors and regular drug susceptibility test is mandatory to reduce the problem.","['Ameya G', 'Tsalla T', 'Getu F', 'Getu E']",2018,17,1,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,"Ameya G, et al.

29366889,"Is perturbation in the quaternary structure of bacterial CysE, another regulatory mechanism for cysteine synthesis?","Drug resistance to almost all antibiotics of Shigella flexneri, a major cause of shigellosis in developing countries, necessitates continuous discovery of novel therapeutics. This study reports a structure-function analysis of a potential drug target serine acetyltransferase (CysE), an enzyme of de novo cysteine biosynthesis pathway that is absent in humans. Analysis of CysE sequences of S. flexneri species and serotypes displayed only two variants that differed by a single amino acid substitution at position 241. Structural inspection of the available crystal structure disclosed this site to be distinct from the substrate/cofactor binding pockets or dimer/trimer interfaces. This study discovers that V241 variant of S. flexneri CysE has nearly null enzymatic activity. The observation is explained by molecular dynamic studies which reveal that the disorder generated by A241V substitution is the basis of dissociation of the quaternary assembly of S. flexneri CysE leading to loss of enzymatic activity and stability. The study provides the first evidence that position 241 of CysE, affects the catalytic efficiency of enzyme and suggests this locus as a 'hot spot' for the propagation of conformational changes. It may be postulated that transient quaternary structure of CysE maybe another mechanism for regulating the intracellular level of cysteine.","['Verma D', 'Gupta S', 'Kaur KJ', 'Gupta V']",2018,111,,Int J Biol Macromol,"Verma D, et al.

29361998,Disease burden of psittacosis in the Netherlands.,"Psittacosis (infection with Chlamydia psittaci) can have diverse presentations in humans, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe systemic disease. Awareness of psittacosis and its presentations are low among clinicians and the general public. Therefore, underdiagnosis and thereby underestimation of the incidence and public health importance of psittacosis is very likely. We used the methodology developed for the Burden of communicable diseases in Europe toolkit of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, to construct a model to estimate disease burden in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to psittacosis. Using this model, we estimated the disease burden caused by psittacosis in the Netherlands to have been 222 DALY per year (95% CI 172-280) over the period 2012-2014. This is comparable with the amount of DALYs estimated to be due to rubella or shigellosis in the same period in the Netherlands. Our results highlight the public health importance of psittacosis and identify evidence gaps pertaining to the clinical presentations and prognosis of this disease.","['de Gier B', 'Hogerwerf L', 'Dijkstra F', 'van der Hoek W']",2018,146,3,Epidemiol Infect,"de Gier B, et al.

METHODS: Tetracycline susceptibility was established in 187 Shigella spp. (74 Shigella flexneri and 113 Shigella sonnei), of which 153 isolates were recovered as a confirmed cause of traveller's diarrhoea. The prevalence of the tet(A), tet(B) and tet(G) genes was analysed by PCR. Eighteen plasmid Inc groups was determined in a subset of 59 isolates.
RESULTS: Among 154 tetracycline-resistant isolates, 122 (79.2%) harboured at least tet(A) or tet(B). The tet(B) gene was the most frequently detected, being present in 70 isolates (45.5%), whilst tet(A) was detected in 57 isolates (37.0%). The tet(G) gene was present in only 11 (7.2%) isolates. Moreover, the tet(A) gene was more frequent in S. sonnei (P=0.0007), whilst the tet(B) gene was more frequent in S. flexneri (P<0.0001). Plasmids belonging to Inc group B (P<0.05) were significantly more frequent among S. flexneri, whilst those belonging to groups K, FIC and FIIA (P<0.05) were preferentially detected among S. sonnei.

29304144,A clinically parameterized mathematical model of Shigella immunity to inform vaccine design.,"We refine and clinically parameterize a mathematical model of the humoral immune response against Shigella, a diarrheal bacteria that infects 80-165 million people and kills an estimated 600,000 people worldwide each year. Using Latin hypercube sampling and Monte Carlo simulations for parameter estimation, we fit our model to human immune data from two Shigella EcSf2a-2 vaccine trials and a rechallenge study in which antibody and B-cell responses against Shigella's lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and O-membrane proteins (OMP) were recorded. The clinically grounded model is used to mathematically investigate which key immune mechanisms and bacterial targets confer immunity against Shigella and to predict which humoral immune components should be elicited to create a protective vaccine against Shigella. The model offers insight into why the EcSf2a-2 vaccine had low efficacy and demonstrates that at a group level a humoral immune response induced by EcSf2a-2 vaccine or wild-type challenge against Shigella's LPS or OMP does not appear sufficient for protection. That is, the model predicts an uncontrolled infection of gut epithelial cells that is present across all best-fit model parameterizations when fit to EcSf2a-2 vaccine or wild-type challenge data. Using sensitivity analysis, we explore which model parameter values must be altered to prevent the destructive epithelial invasion by Shigella bacteria and identify four key parameter groups as potential vaccine targets or immune correlates: 1) the rate that Shigella migrates into the lamina propria or epithelium, 2) the rate that memory B cells (BM) differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASC), 3) the rate at which antibodies are produced by activated ASC, and 4) the Shigella-specific BM carrying capacity.

Hunan Province is one of the provinces having the highest risk of bacillary dysentery in China, however, the spatial-temporal distribution, variation of bacillary dysentery and sensitivity to meteorological factors in there are unclear. In this paper, a Bayesian space-time hierarchical model (BSTHM) was used to detect space-time variation, and effects of meteorological factors between 2010 and 2015. The risk of bacillary dysentery showed apparent spatial-temporal heterogeneity. The highest risk occurred in the summer season. Economically undeveloped mountainous areas in the west and south of the province had the highest incidence rates. Twenty three (18.9%) and 20 (16.4%) counties were identified as hot and cold spots, respectively. Among the hotspots, 11 counties (47.8%) exhibited a rapidly decreasing trend, suggesting they may become low-risk areas in the future. Of the cold spot counties, six (30%) showed a slowly decreasing trend, and may have a higher risk in the future. Among meteorological factors, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed all played a significant role in the spatial-temporal distribution of bacillary dysentery risk. These findings can contribute to the implementation of an early warning system for controlling and preventing bacillary dysentery.","['Xu C', 'Xiao G', 'Wang J', 'Zhang X', 'Liang J']",2017,15,1,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Xu C, et al.

Here, we show that geraniol, a natural substance present in the essential oils of plants such as rose and lemongrass, can reduce S. sonnei proliferation inside host cells and protect Galleria mellonella larvae from killing by S. sonnei infection. We present evidence that geraniol competitively inhibits the catalytic activity of the master virulence regulator, DsbA, a periplasmic disulphide bond oxidoreductase required for Shigella survival in the host cell cytosol.

29254859,Shigellosis.,"Shigellosis is a clinical syndrome caused by invasion of the epithelium lining the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum by Shigella species. Although infections occur globally, and in people of all ages, endemic infections among children aged 1-4 years living in low-income and middle-income settings constitute most of the disease burden. The versatile manifestations of these highly contagious organisms range from acute watery diarrhoea to fulminant dysentery characterised by frequent scant bloody stools with fever, prostration, and abdominal cramps. A broad array of uncommon, but often severe, intestinal and extraintestinal complications can occur. Despite marked reductions in mortality during the past three decades, there are roughly 164 000 annual deaths attributable to shigellosis. Intercontinental dissemination of multiresistant shigella strains, facilitated by travellers and men who have sex with men, has prompted new recommendations for antibiotic therapy.

29251673,Recent epidemiology of sexually transmissible enteric infections in men who have sex with men.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sexual transmission of enteric pathogens in men who have sex with men (MSM) has been described since the 1970s. Recently, an increasing number of enteric infection outbreaks have been reported in MSM. This article summarizes recent outbreaks and discusses the key issues for prevention and control.
RECENT FINDINGS: Sexually transmissible enteric infections (STEIs) can spread rapidly and internationally within highly connected MSM populations and are often associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The infections often cluster in high-risk groups of HIV-positive MSM who are more likely to engage in diverse sexual practices and chemsex, and to have multiple other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
SUMMARY: The roles of asymptomatic and/or persistent infection and other contextual factors in STEI transmission are not well described. STEI-associated AMR is increasing and has potential to spread rapidly in MSM, warranting further public health attention. A better understanding of the factors associated with sexual transmission will enable the development of more effective control measures. A holistic approach that promotes health and wellbeing as well as infection prevention and management is needed.","['Mitchell H', 'Hughes G']",2018,31,1,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Mitchell H and Hughes G.

29217465,"Heavy precipitation as a risk factor for shigellosis among homeless persons during an outbreak - Oregon, 2015-2016.","OBJECTIVES: Shigella species are the third most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. During a Shigella sonnei outbreak in Oregon from July 2015 through June 2016, Shigella cases spread among homeless persons with onset of the wettest rainy season on record.
METHODS: We conducted time series analyses using Poisson regression to determine if a temporal association between precipitation and shigellosis incidence existed. Models were stratified by housing status.
RESULTS: Among 105 infections identified, 45 (43%) occurred in homeless persons. With increasing precipitation, cases increased among homeless persons (relative risk [RR] = 1.36 per inch of precipitation during the exposure period; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17-1.59), but not among housed persons (RR = 1.04; 95% CI 0.86-1.25).
CONCLUSIONS: Heavy precipitation likely contributed to shigellosis transmission among homeless persons during this outbreak. When heavy precipitation is forecast, organizations working with homeless persons could consider taking proactive measures to mitigate spread of enteric infections.","['Hines JZ', 'Jagger MA', 'Jeanne TL', 'West N', 'Winquist A', 'Robinson BF', 'Leman RF', 'Hedberg K']",2018,76,3,J Infect,"Hines JZ, et al.

Fecal specimens were collected along with socioeconomic and clinical data from children with moderate to severe diarrhea requiring emergency care. Shigella spp. were isolated by standard microbiological techniques, and we developed 4 multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays to detect 16 virulence-related genes (VRGs). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using disk diffusion assays. S. flexneri and S. sonnei were the predominant serogroups. S. flexneri was associated with low monthly incomes; more severe disease; higher number of VRGs; and presence of pic, set, and sepA genes. The SepA gene was associated with more intense abdominal pain. S. flexneri was correlated with resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol, whereas S. sonnei was associated with resistance to azithromycin. Strains harboring higher numbers of VRGs were associated with resistance to more antimicrobials. We highlight the correlation between presence of S. flexneri and sepA, and increased virulence and suggest a link to socioeconomic change in northeastern Brazil. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance was associated with serogroup specificity in Shigella spp. and increased bacterial VRGs.","['Medeiros PHQS', 'Lima AÂM', 'Guedes MM', 'Havt A', 'Bona MD', 'Rey LC', 'Soares AM', 'Guerrant RL', 'Weigl BH', 'Lima IFN']",2018,90,3,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"Medeiros PHQS, et al.

This study was carried out to find the mutations within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) and the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants among the clinical isolates of Shigella sp. in Tehran, Iran. A total of 50 Shigella isolates were collected from five teaching therapeutic centers in Tehran, Iran and analyzed for antibiotic susceptibility over a period of 20 months from July 2015 to January 2017. The PCR and direct nucleotide sequencing were used for genetic alterations in the QRDRs. The PMQR genes were detected using PCR. The results revealed four types of mutations in the QRDR of gyrA: 20 (40%) had a S83L mutation, 1 (2%) had a S83A mutation, 2 (4%) had a D87G mutation, and 1 (2%) isolate had a D87Y mutation. Mutations were also found at codon N57D, D200N, and E210K in three isolates. Seven hospitalized children had qnrS determinants, and one isolates had the mutation S83A, while two isolates had double mutations at S83L and/or D87G (Ser83Leu and Asp-87Gly). The PMQR gene-positive isolates had the single replacement of serine with leucine. In hospitalized children, two isolates had two types of PMQR determinants (qnrS and qnrA) and (qnrS and qnrB) at once. The results of this study indicate that the emergence of strains with mutations in the QRDR regions and the capture of PMQR determinants in strains may lead to failure in therapy with FQ and the widespread emergence of strains with high-level FQ resistance.","['Yaghoubi S', 'Ranjbar R', 'Soltan Dallal MM', 'Shirazi MH', 'Sharifi-Yazdi MK']",2018,24,6,Microb Drug Resist,"Yaghoubi S, et al.

29144452,Ubiquitination and degradation of GBPs by a Shigella effector to suppress host defence.,"Interferon-inducible guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) mediate cell-autonomous antimicrobial defences. Shigella flexneri, a Gram-negative cytoplasmic free-living bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery, encodes a repertoire of highly similar type III secretion system effectors called invasion plasmid antigen Hs (IpaHs). IpaHs represent a large family of bacterial ubiquitin-ligases, but their function is poorly understood. Here we show that S. flexneri infection induces rapid proteasomal degradation of human guanylate binding protein-1 (hGBP1). We performed a transposon screen to identify a mutation in the S. flexneri gene ipaH9.8 that prevented hGBP1 degradation. IpaH9.8 targets hGBP1 for degradation via Lys48-linked ubiquitination. IpaH9.8 targets multiple GBPs in the cytoplasm independently of their nucleotide-bound states and their differential function in antibacterial defence, promoting S. flexneri replication and resulting in the death of infected mice. In the absence of IpaH9.8, or when binding of GBPs to IpaH9.8 was disrupted, GBPs such as hGBP1 and mouse GBP2 (mGBP2) translocated to intracellular S. flexneri and inhibited bacterial replication. Like wild-type mice, mutant mice deficient in GBP1-3, 5 and 7 succumbed to S. flexneri infection, but unlike wild-type mice, mice deficient in these GBPs were also susceptible to S. flexneri lacking ipaH9.8. The mode of IpaH9.8 action highlights the functional importance of GBPs in antibacterial defences. IpaH9.8 and S. flexneri provide a unique system for dissecting GBP-mediated immunity.","['Li P', 'Jiang W', 'Yu Q', 'Liu W', 'Zhou P', 'Li J', 'Xu J', 'Xu B', 'Wang F', 'Shao F']",2017,551,7680,Nature,"Li P, et al.

29134812,Deoxycholate-Enhanced Shigella Virulence Is Regulated by a Rare π-Helix in the Type Three Secretion System Tip Protein IpaD.,"Type three secretion systems (T3SS) are specialized nanomachines that support infection by injecting bacterial proteins directly into host cells. The Shigella T3SS has uniquely evolved to sense environmental levels of the bile salt deoxycholate (DOC) and upregulate virulence in response to DOC. In this study, we describe a rare i + 5 hydrogen bonding secondary structure element (π-helix) within the type three secretion system tip protein IpaD that plays a critical role in DOC-enhanced virulence. Specifically, engineered mutations within the π-helix altered the pathogen's response to DOC, with one mutant construct in particular exhibiting an unprecedented reduction in virulence following DOC exposure. Fluorescence polarization binding assays showed that these altered DOC responses are not the result of differences in affinity between IpaD and DOC, but rather differences in the DOC-dependent T3SS tip maturation resulting from binding of IpaD to translocator/effector protein IpaB. Together, these findings begin to uncover the complex mechanism of DOC-enhanced Shigella virulence while identifying an uncommon structural element that may provide a much needed target for non-antibiotic treatment of Shigella infection.","['Bernard AR', 'Jessop TC', 'Kumar P', 'Dickenson NE']",2017,56,49,Biochemistry,"Bernard AR, et al.

As these pathogens are accumulating quinolone resistance, treating infections caused by them has become complicated.
METHODS: In this study, Vibrio and Shigella spp. isolates obtained from diarrhoeal patients from Kolkata, India, over a period of 12 years (1998-2009) were analysed for quinolone resistance. A total of 27 Vibrio spp. (9 Vibrio cholerae, 11 Vibrio fluvialis and 7 Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and 10 Shigella spp. isolates (7 Shigella flexneri, 2 Shigella dysenteriae and 1 Shigella sonnei) showing reduced susceptibility to quinolones were studied to unravel the genetic factors responsible for quinolone resistance.
RESULTS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed a wide spectrum and varying degree of resistance to different generations of quinolones. Genotypic characterisation revealed the involvement of GyrA(S83I) and ParC(S85L) mutations in V. cholerae and V. fluvialis, whereas Shigella spp. isolates showed the mutations S83L and/or D87N/Y in GyrA and S80I or E84K in ParC. Analysis of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes showed that qnrVC5 was detected in three V. fluvialis isolates, aac(6')-Ib-cr in one V. fluvialis isolate and qnrS1 in a S. flexneri isolate.
CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasise that quinolone resistance is widespread and therefore quinolones should be used prudently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where resistance to various generations of quinolones in Vibrio and Shigella spp. has been examined in terms of detailed genotype-phenotype correlation.","['Vinothkumar K', 'Bhalara SR', 'Shah A', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Niyogi SK', 'Kumar GN', 'Bhardwaj AK']",2018,13,,J Glob Antimicrob Resist,"Vinothkumar K, et al.

An estimated 477,000 annual ED visits (95% CI: 459,000-494,000) were documented, with 21% (n = 101,000, 95% CI: 97,000-105,000) resulting in immediate hospital admission. The remaining 376,000 annual treat-and-release ED visits (95% CI: 361,000-390,000) resulted in $194 million in annual direct costs. Most treat-and-release ED visits (97%) and costs ($178 million/year) were associated with acute otitis externa. HAV ($5.5 million), NTM ($2.3 million), and salmonellosis ($2.2 million) were associated with next highest total costs. Cryptosporidiosis ($2,035), campylobacteriosis ($1,783), and NTM ($1,709) had the highest mean costs per treat-and-release ED visit. Overall, the annual hospitalization and treat-and-release ED visit costs associated with the selected diseases totaled $3.8 billion. As most of these diseases are not solely transmitted by water, an attribution process is needed as a next step to determine the proportion of these visits and costs attributable to waterborne transmission.","['Adam EA', 'Collier SA', 'Fullerton KE', 'Gargano JW', 'Beach MJ']",2017,15,5,J Water Health,"Adam EA, et al.

29039494,Internal driving factors leading to extrahepatic manifestation of the hepatitis C virus infection.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with various extrahepatic manifestations, which are correlated with poor outcomes, and thus increase the morbidity and mortality of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Therefore, understanding the internal linkages between systemic manifestations and HCV infection is helpful for treatment of CHC. Yet, the mechanism by which the virus evokes the systemic diseases remains to be elucidated. In the present study, using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA), a comprehensive analysis of microarray data of mRNAs was conducted in HCV-infected and -uninfected Huh7.5 cells, and signaling pathways (which are significantly activated or inhibited) and certain molecules (which are commonly important in those signaling pathways) were selected. Forty signaling pathways were selected using GSEA, and eight signaling pathways were selected with SPIA. These pathways are associated with cancer, metabolism, environmental information processing and organismal systems, which provide important information for further clarifying the intrinsic associations between syndromes of HCV infection, of which seven pathways were not previously reported, including basal transcription factors, pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, shigellosis, gastric acid secretion, dorso-ventral axis formation, amoebiasis and cholinergic synapse. Ten genes, SOS1, RAF1, IFNA2, IFNG, MTHFR, IGF1, CALM3, UBE2B, TP53 and BMP7 whose expression may be the key internal driving molecules, were selected using the online tool Anni 2.1. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated the internal linkages between systemic manifestations and HCV infection, and presented the potential molecules that are key to those linkages.","['Wu ZY', 'Li JR', 'Huang MH', 'Cheng JJ', 'Li H', 'Chen JH', 'Lv XQ', 'Peng ZG', 'Jiang JD']",2017,40,6,Int J Mol Med,"Wu ZY, et al.

29030321,"Destination specific risks of acquisition of notifiable food- and waterborne infections or sexually transmitted infections among Finnish international travellers, 1995-2015.","BACKGROUND: Overnight international travels made by Finns more than doubled during 1995-2015. To estimate risks and observe trends of travel-related notifiable sexually transmitted and food- and water-borne infections (STIs and FWIs) among travellers, we analysed national reports of gonorrhoea, syphilis, hepatitis A, shigellosis, campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis cases and related them to travel statistics.
METHOD: Cases notified as travel-related to the Finnish infectious diseases register were used as numerators and overnight stays of Statistics Finland surveys as denominator. We calculated overall risks (per 100,000 travellers) and assessed trends (using regression model) in various geographic regions.
RESULTS: Of all travel-related cases during 1995-2015, 2304 were STIs and 70,929 FWIs. During 2012-2015, Asia-Oceania showed highest risk estimates for gonorrhoea (11.0; 95%CI, 9.5-13), syphilis (1.4; 0.93-2.1), salmonellosis (157; 151-164), and campylobacteriosis (135; 129-141), and Africa for hepatitis A (4.5; 2.5-7.9), and shigellosis (35; 28-43). When evaluating at country level, the highest risks of infections was found in Thailand, except for hepatitis A ranking Hungary the first. During 2000-2011, significantly decreasing trends occurred for most FWIs particularly in the European regions and for STIs in Russia-Baltics.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings can be used in targeting pre-travel advice, which should also cover those visiting Thailand or European hepatitis A risk areas.","['Zöldi V', 'Sane J', 'Kantele A', 'Rimhanen-Finne R', 'Salmenlinna S', 'Lyytikäinen O']",2018,25,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Zöldi V, et al.

Diarrheal disease and long-term sequelae caused by infections with the bacterial pathogens Shigella and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) pose a significant public health burden in low-income communities. There are currently no licensed vaccines against these pathogens, and the global health community has recently prioritized their development. The 2016 VASE Conference aimed to accelerate communication and progress among those working in the enteric vaccine field to make Shigella and ETEC vaccines a reality as quickly as possible. Research presented in oral and poster presentations at the VASE Conference covered a range of topics, including: the global burden of disease and public health case for Shigella and ETEC vaccines; current vaccine candidates in development; immunology and host responses to the pathogens; and the rationale for and status of combined Shigella-ETEC vaccine candidates. This article reviews key points and highlighted research presented in each of the plenary conference sessions and poster presentations at the 2016 conference. Planning for the 2018 VASE Conference is underway and will likely provide an important platform for sharing the latest updates on Shigella and ETEC vaccine research efforts and maintaining the momentum for accelerating this work. It is also expected that the VASE Conference will continue to provide a unique opportunity for those in the enteric vaccine field to share ideas, make connections, and create workable plans to make Shigella and ETEC vaccines a reality.

METHODS: Fecal samples from children aged 6 mos-15 yrs presenting with acute diarrhea in western Kenya were cultured for bacterial pathogens. HIV-uninfected children with identified Shigella or Salmonella species or pathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC, ETEC, EAEC or EIEC) were included in this cross-sectional sub-study. Non-susceptibility to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, and tetracycline was determined using MicroScan Walkaway40 Plus. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to identify correlates of multi-drug non-susceptibility (MDNS, non-susceptibility to ≥ 3 of these antibiotics).
RESULTS: Of 292 included children, median age was 22.5 mos. MDNS was identified in 62.5% of 318 isolates. Non-susceptibility to cotrimoxazole (92.8%), ampicillin (81.3%), and tetracycline (75.0%) was common. Young age (6-24 mos vs. 24-59 mos adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.519 [95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.91]), maternal HIV (aPR = 1.29 [1.01, 1.66]); and acute malnutrition (aPR = 1.28 [1.06, 1.55]) were associated with higher prevalence of MDNS, as were open defecation (aPR = 2.25 [1.13, 4.50]), household crowding (aPR = 1.29 [1.08, 1.53]) and infrequent caregiver hand-washing (aPR = 1.50 [1.15, 1.95]).

Recent multicenter studies have improved our understanding of the prognosis of atypical hemolytic and uremic syndromes (aHUS). More specifically, they have highlighted the role of genetic testing on predicting the recurrence of aHUS, the risk of chronic kidney disease and the recurrence following kidney transplantation. A major advance consisted of the identification of the alternative complement pathway in the pathogenesis of aHUS, thus paving the way for the use of the C5a inhibitor eculizumab in this indication. Eculizumab has thereafter dramatically improved the management of patients affected with aHUS. During spring 2011, a great epidemic of entero-hemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) associated HUS occurred in Germany, providing clinicians the opportunity to examine the relevance of antibiotic prophylaxis, plasma exchange and eculizumab in EHEC-associated HUS. In this work, we herein present advances achieved in the setting of therapeutic management and prognosis in HUS and other related TMA syndromes.","['Rafat C', 'Coppo P', 'Fakhouri F', 'Frémeaux-Bacchi V', 'Loirat C', 'Zuber J', 'Rondeau E']",2017,38,12,Rev Med Interne,"Rafat C, et al.

We described the imported infectious diseases in Korea from 2003 to 2012, and to analyze association of travels with the change in the incidences.
METHODS: We used National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System to investigate the incidence of salmonellosis, shigellosis, malaria, and dengue. Data from Korea Tourism Organization was used to describe the inbound and outbound travelers by their age group, gender, and purpose of travel. We assessed association between international travel and the incidence of the infectious diseases, and seasonal variability.
RESULTS: Among 1849 imported cases, dengue comprised the largest number with 631 cases. The proportion of imported cases among total cases gradually increased from 4.1% in 2003 to 30.3% in 2012 (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the number of travelers and the number of imported cases of shigellosis, dengue (P < 0.001), but not for malaria. Seasonal variability was observed for importation of salmonellosis, shigellosis and dengue fever (P = 0.005).

S. flexneri serotype 1c is a novel serotype, which is found to be endemic in many developing countries, but little is known about its genomic architecture and virulence signatures. We have sequenced for the first time, the complete genome of S. flexneri serotype 1c strain Y394, to provide insights into its diversity and evolution.
RESULTS: We generated a high-quality reference genome of S. flexneri serotype 1c using the hybrid methods of long-read single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology and short-read MiSeq (Illumina) sequencing technology. The Y394 chromosome is 4.58 Mb in size and shares the basic genomic features with other S. flexneri complete genomes. However, it possesses unique and highly modified O-antigen structure comprising of three distinct O-antigen modifying gene clusters that potentially came from three different bacteriophages. It also possesses a large number of hypothetical unique genes compared to other S. flexneri genomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high level of structural and functional similarities of Y394 genome with other S. flexneri genomes, there are marked differences in the pathogenic islands. The diversity in the pathogenic islands suggests that these bacterial pathogens are well adapted to respond to the selection pressures during their evolution, which might contribute to the differences in their virulence potential.","['Parajuli P', 'Adamski M', 'Verma NK']",2017,18,1,BMC Genomics,"Parajuli P, et al.

Although recent studies indicate decreasing incidence of TD among short-term travelers, a systematic review of illness among long-term travelers, including deployed military personnel, has not been conducted in more than 10 years. We conducted a literature search of studies published between 2005 and 2015 that evaluated TD in populations of deployed military personnel or similar long-term travelers (travel ≥1 month) to developing nations. Our literature search identified 28 studies for inclusion. We found that the incidence of TD remained high (10% clinical incidence, 30% self-reported incidence), with variability depending on region of travel and similar rates in both military and civilian long-term travelers. Bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Salmonella species) were the most commonly identified enteropathogens. Fifty percent of affected individuals experienced lost ability to work and 5% required hospitalization. This systematic review demonstrates that among deployed military personnel and long-term travelers, TD remains a prevalent disease that can significantly impact individual readiness for duty. These data demonstrate that to maintain operational readiness among deployed personnel, a focus on vigilance for disease and early treatment of cases is vital.","['Porter CK', 'Olson S', 'Hall A', 'Riddle MS']",2017,182,S2,Mil Med,"Porter CK, et al.

28853989,Genomic Analysis and Resistance Mechanisms in Shigella flexneri 2a Strain 301.,"Shigella flexneri is one of the most prominent pathogenic bacteria in developing countries. In the battle against shigellosis and other bacterial diseases, antibiotic resistance has become an increasing global public health threat. Although the serious phenomenon of multidrug resistance (MDR) has been identified as one of the top three burdens on human health, resistance mechanisms are still poorly understood at the molecular level. In this study, we analyzed genomic data and the evolution of resistance in Shigella flexneri under sequential selection stress from three separate antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (CIP), ceftriaxone (CRO), and tetracycline. Through whole-genome sequencing, 82 chromosomal antibiotic resistance genes were identified. Re-sequencing of the evolved populations identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contributed to MDR and SNPs that were specific to a single drug. A total of 40 SNPs in 8 genes and 3 intergenic regions, including mutations in metG (L582R) and 1538924, 1538924, and 1538924, appeared under each antibiotic. Several nonsynonymous mutations in gyrB (S464Y), ydgA (E378A), rob (R156H), and narX (K75E) were observed under selective pressure from CIP or CRO. Based on a bioinformatic analysis and previous reports, we discuss the contribution of these mutated genes to resistance. Therefore, more circumspect selection and use of antimicrobial drugs for treating shigellosis is necessary.","['Zhu Z', 'Zhou X', 'Li B', 'Wang S', 'Cheng F', 'Zhang J']",2018,24,3,Microb Drug Resist,"Zhu Z, et al.

The antigenicity of outer membrane protein of this pathogen expressed during human infection has not been identified to date. We have studied the antigenic outer membrane proteins expressed by S. sonnei, with the aim of identifying presence of specific IgA and IgG in human serum against the candidate protein biomarkers. Three antigenic OMPs sized 33.3, 43.8 and 100.3 kDa were uniquely recognized by IgA and IgG from patients with S. sonnei infection, and did not cross-react with sera from patients with other types of infection. The antigenic proteome data generated in this study are a first for OMPs of S. sonnei, and they provide important insights of human immune responses. Furthermore, numerous prime candidate proteins were identified which will aid the development of new diagnostic tools for the detection of S. sonnei.","['Harikrishnan H', 'Banga Singh KK', 'Ismail A']",2017,12,8,PLoS One,"Harikrishnan H, et al.

28844213,"Effects of rhubarb (Rheum ribes L.) syrup on dysenteric diarrhea in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Rheum ribes L. is a plant native to China, Iran, Turkey, India, and a few other countries. Antidiarrheal activity is considered to be one of its important properties according to various systems of traditional medicine. An increasing rate of bacterial resistance to antibiotics has led to treatment failure in some cases of shigellosis in children, and underlines a need for safe, efficient and valid options.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of R. ribes syrup as a complementary medicine for treatment of shigellosis in children.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial started with a group of 150 children aged between 12-72 months with suspected Shigella dysentery. R. ribes syrup or placebo syrup was administered to the intervention and control groups, respectively for 5 days. In addition, the standard antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone for the first 3 days and cefixime syrup for 2 further days) was administered to both groups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body temperature, abdominal pain, need for antipyretics, defecation frequency, stool volume and consistency and microscopic stool examination were recorded as outcome measures. Any observed adverse effects were also recorded.
RESULTS: Mean duration of fever and diarrhea in the R. ribes group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (P = 0.016 and 0.001, respectively). In addition, patients in the R. ribes group showed shorter duration of need for antipyretics and shorter duration of abdominal pain (P = 0.012 and 0.001, respectively). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the microscopic stool analyses. Furthermore, no adverse effect was reported.
CONCLUSION: R. ribes syrup can be recommended as a complementary treatment for children with Shigella dysentery.

28826780,Towards a peptide-based vaccine against Shigella sonnei: A subtractive reverse vaccinology based approach.,"Shigella sonnei is one of the major causes of shigellosis in technically advanced countries and reports of its unprecedented increase are published from the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. The pathogen exhibits resistance against first and second line antibiotics which highlights the need for the development of an effective broad-spectrum vaccine. A computational based approach comprising subtractive reverse vaccinology was used for the identification of potential peptide-based vaccine candidates in the proteome of S. sonnei reference strain (53G). The protocol revealed three essential, host non-homologous, highly virulent, antigenic, conserved and adhesive vaccine proteins: TolC, PhoE, and outer membrane porin protein. The cellular interactome of these proteins supports their direct and indirect involvement in biologically significant pathways, essential for pathogen survival. Epitope mapping of these candidates reveals the presence of surface exposed 9-mer B-cell-derived T-cell epitopes of an antigenic, virulent, non-allergen nature and have broad-spectrum potency. In addition, molecular docking studies demonstrated the deep binding of the epitopes in the binding groove and the stability of the complex with the most common binding allele in the human population, DRB1*0101. Future characterization of the screened epitopes in order to further investigate the immune protection efficacy in animal models is highly desirable.","['Baseer S', 'Ahmad S', 'Ranaghan KE', 'Azam SS']",2017,50,,Biologicals,"Baseer S, et al.

We determined the prevalence of Y. enterocolitica infection and strain types present among children <5 years of age with diarrhea in China. The overall prevalence of pathogenic isolates was 0.59%. Prevalence of pathogenic bioserotype 3/O:3 varied geographically. In this population, the presence of fecal leukocytes was a characteristic of Y. enterocolitica infection and should be used as an indication for microbiological diagnostic testing, rather than for the diagnosis of bacillary dysentery. In contrast with Y. enterocolitica isolates from adults, which were primarily biotype 1A, isolates from children were primarily bioserotype 3/O:3. Most pathogenic isolates from children shared pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns with isolates from pigs and dogs, suggesting a possible link between isolates from animals and infections in children.

28802838,Identification of immune correlates of protection in Shigella infection by application of machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: Immunologic correlates of protection are important in vaccine development because they give insight into mechanisms of protection, assist in the identification of promising vaccine candidates, and serve as endpoints in bridging clinical vaccine studies. Our goal is the development of a methodology to identify immunologic correlates of protection using the Shigella challenge as a model.
METHODS: The proposed methodology utilizes the Random Forests (RF) machine learning algorithm as well as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to detect immune markers that predict protection, identify interactions between variables, and define optimal cutoffs. Logistic regression modeling is applied to estimate the probability of protection and the confidence interval (CI) for such a probability is computed by bootstrapping the logistic regression models.
RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the combination of Classification and Regression Trees and Random Forests complements the standard logistic regression and uncovers subtle immune interactions. Specific levels of immunoglobulin IgG antibody in blood on the day of challenge predicted protection in 75% (95% CI 67-86). Of those subjects that did not have blood IgG at or above a defined threshold, 100% were protected if they had IgA antibody secreting cells above a defined threshold. Comparison with the results obtained by applying only logistic regression modeling with standard Akaike Information Criterion for model selection shows the usefulness of the proposed method.
CONCLUSION: Given the complexity of the immune system, the use of machine learning methods may enhance traditional statistical approaches. When applied together, they offer a novel way to quantify important immune correlates of protection that may help the development of vaccines.","['Arevalillo JM', 'Sztein MB', 'Kotloff KL', 'Levine MM', 'Simon JK']",2017,74,,J Biomed Inform,"Arevalillo JM, et al.

Our efficacy study of Shigella sonnei and S. flexneri 2a O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) conjugates in 1-4year-olds had too few S. flexneri 2a cases for efficacy evaluation but surprisingly showed protection of 3-4year-olds, S. flexneri 2a-recipients, from S. flexneri 6 infection. To investigate this cross-protection antibodies to both Shigella types were investigated in all sera remaining from previous studies. Twenty to 30% of 3-44year-old humans injected with S. flexneri 2a conjugate responded with ≥4-fold increases of IgG anti type 6, p<0.00001. The specificity of these antibodies was shown by inhibition studies. S. flexneri 6 infection of 2 children induced besides S. flexneri 6, also S. flexneri 2a antibodies, at levels of S. flexneri 2a vaccinees. S. flexneri 2a antibodies induced by S. flexneri 6 conjugates could not be studied since no such conjugate was assessed in humans and mice responded almost exclusively to the O-SP of the injected conjugate, with no cross-reactive antibodies. Our results indicate induction of cross-reactive protective antibodies. The O-acetylated disaccharide shared by S. flexneri 6 and 2a O-SPs, is the likely basis for their cross-reactivity.

This paper aimed to quantify the relationship between meteorological variables and BD cases in Beijing and to establish an effective forecasting model.
METHODS: A time series analysis was conducted in the Beijing area based upon monthly data on weather variables (i.e. temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, vapor pressure, and wind speed) and on the number of BD cases during the period 1970-2012. Autoregressive integrated moving average models with explanatory variables (ARIMAX) were built based on the data from 1970 to 2004. Prediction of monthly BD cases from 2005 to 2012 was made using the established models. The prediction accuracy was evaluated by the mean square error (MSE).
RESULTS: Firstly, temperature with 2-month and 7-month lags and rainfall with 12-month lag were found positively correlated with the number of BD cases in Beijing. Secondly, ARIMAX model with covariates of temperature with 7-month lag (β = 0.021, 95% confidence interval(CI): 0.004-0.038) and rainfall with 12-month lag (β = 0.023, 95% CI: 0.009-0.037) displayed the highest prediction accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: The ARIMAX model developed in this study showed an accurate goodness of fit and precise prediction accuracy in the short term, which would be beneficial for government departments to take early public health measures to prevent and control possible BD popularity.","['Yan L', 'Wang H', 'Zhang X', 'Li MY', 'He J']",2017,12,8,PLoS One,"Yan L, et al.

28767653,In silico analysis to identify vaccine candidates common to multiple serotypes of Shigella and evaluation of their immunogenicity.,"Shigellosis or bacillary dysentery is an important cause of diarrhea, with the majority of the cases occurring in developing countries. Considering the high disease burden, increasing antibiotic resistance, serotype-specific immunity and the post-infectious sequelae associated with shigellosis, there is a pressing need of an effective vaccine against multiple serotypes of the pathogen. In the present study, we used bio-informatics approach to identify antigens shared among multiple serotypes of Shigella spp. This approach led to the identification of many immunogenic peptides. The five most promising peptides based on MHC binding efficiency were a putative lipoprotein (EL PGI I), a putative heat shock protein (EL PGI II), Spa32 (EL PGI III), IcsB (EL PGI IV) and a hypothetical protein (EL PGI V). These peptides were synthesized and the immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice by ELISA and cytokine assays. The putative heat shock protein (HSP) and the hypothetical protein elicited good humoral response, whereas putative lipoprotein, Spa32 and IcsB elicited good T-cell response as revealed by increased IFN-γ and TNF-α cytokine levels. The patient sera from confirmed cases of shigellosis were also evaluated for the presence of peptide specific antibodies with significant IgG and IgA antibodies against the HSP and the hypothetical protein, bestowing them as potential future vaccine candidates. The antigens reported in this study are novel and have not been tested as vaccine candidates against Shigella. This study offers time and cost-effective way of identifying unprecedented immunogenic antigens to be used as potential vaccine candidates. Moreover, this approach should easily be extendable to find new potential vaccine candidates for other pathogenic bacteria.","['Pahil S', 'Taneja N', 'Ansari HR', 'Raghava GPS']",2017,12,8,PLoS One,"Pahil S, et al.

28735965,"Safety Profile and Immunologic Responses of a Novel Vaccine Against Shigella sonnei Administered Intramuscularly, Intradermally and Intranasally: Results From Two Parallel Randomized Phase 1 Clinical Studies in Healthy Adult Volunteers in Europe.","BACKGROUND: Approximately 164,000 deaths yearly are due to shigellosis, primarily in developing countries. Thus, a safe and affordable Shigella vaccine is an important public health priority. The GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH) developed a candidate Shigella sonnei vaccine (1790GAHB) using the Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA) technology. The paper reports results of 1790GAHB Phase 1 studies in healthy European adults.
METHODS: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity profiles of 1790GAHB, we performed two parallel, phase 1, observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation studies in France (""study 1"") and the United Kingdom (""study 2"") between February 2014 and April 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02017899 and NCT02034500, respectively) in 18-45years old subjects (50 in study 1, 52 in study 2). Increasing doses of Alhydrogel adsorbed 1790, expressed by both O Antigen (OAg) and protein quantity, or placebo were given either by intramuscular route (0.059/1, 0.29/5, 1.5/25, 2.9/50, 5.9/100μg of OAg/μg of protein; study 1) or by intradermal (ID), intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) route of immunization (0.0059/0.1, 0.059/1, 0.59/10μg ID, 0.29/5, 1.2/20, 4.8/80μg IN and 0.29/5μg IM, respectively; study 2). In absence of serologic correlates of protection for Shigella sonnei, vaccine induced immunogenicity was compared to anti-LPS antibody in a population naturally exposed to S. sonnei.
FINDINGS: Vaccines were well tolerated in both studies and no death or vaccine related serious adverse events were reported. In study 1, doses ≥1.5/25μg elicited serum IgG median antibody greater than median level in convalescent subjects after the first dose. No vaccine group in study 2 achieved median antibody greater than the median convalescent antibody.
INTERPRETATION: Intramuscularly administered Shigella sonnei GMMA vaccine is well tolerated, up to and including 5.9/100μg and induces antibody to the OAg of at least the same magnitude of those observed following natural exposure to the pathogen. Vaccine administered by ID or IN, although well tolerated, is poorly immunogenic at the doses delivered.

28727722,An attenuated Shigella mutant lacking the RNA-binding protein Hfq provides cross-protection against Shigella strains of broad serotype.,"Few live attenuated vaccines protect against multiple serotypes of bacterial pathogen because host serotype-specific immune responses are limited to the serotype present in the vaccine strain. Here, immunization with a mutant of Shigella flexneri 2a protected guinea pigs against subsequent infection by S. dysenteriae type 1 and S. sonnei strains. This deletion mutant lacked the RNA-binding protein Hfq leading to increased expression of the type III secretion system via loss of regulation, resulting in attenuation of cell viability through repression of stress response sigma factors. Such increased antigen production and simultaneous attenuation were expected to elicit protective immunity against Shigella strains of heterologous serotypes. Thus, the vaccine potential of this mutant was tested in two guinea pig models of shigellosis. Animals vaccinated in the left eye showed fewer symptoms upon subsequent challenge via the right eye, and even survived subsequent intestinal challenge. In addition, oral vaccination effectively induced production of immunoglobulins without severe side effects, again protecting all animals against subsequent intestinal challenge with S. dysenteriae type 1 or S. sonnei strains. Antibodies against common virulence proteins and the O-antigen of S. flexneri 2a were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Reaction of antibodies with various strains, including enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, suggested that common virulence proteins induced protective immunity against a range of serotypes. Therefore, vaccination is expected to cover not only the most prevalent serotypes of S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a, but also various Shigella strains, including S. dysenteriae type 1, which produces Shiga toxin.","['Mitobe J', 'Sinha R', 'Mitra S', 'Nag D', 'Saito N', 'Shimuta K', 'Koizumi N', 'Koley H']",2017,11,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Mitobe J, et al.

28721849,Effective protection of mice against Shigella flexneri with a new self-adjuvant multicomponent vaccine.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop an immunogenic protective product against Shigella flexneri by employing a simple and safe heat treatment-based strategy.
METHODOLOGY: The physicochemical characteristics of naturally produced (OMV) and heat-induced (HT) outer-membrane vesicles from S. flexneri were examined, including a comparison of the protein content of the products. Toxicological and biodistribution studies, and a preliminary experiment to examine the protective effectiveness of HT in a murine model of S. flexneri infection, were also included.
RESULTS: This method simultaneously achieves complete bacterial inactivation and the production of the HT vaccine product, leading to a safe working process. The obtained HT complex presented a similar morphology (electron microscopy) and chemical composition to the classical OMV, although it was enriched in some immunogens, such as lipoproteins, OmpA or OmpC, among others. The HT formulation was not toxic and biodistribution studies performed in mice demonstrated that the vaccine product remained in the small intestine after nasal administration. Finally, a single dose of HT administered nasally was able to protect mice against S. flexneri 2a.
CONCLUSION: The convenient and safe manufacturing process, and the preliminary biological evaluation, support the use of the self-adjuvanted HT complex as a new vaccine candidate to face shigellosis. Further development is required, such as additional immune analyses, to evaluate whether this new subunit vaccine can be useful in achieving full protection against Shigella.","['Pastor Y', 'Camacho A', 'Gil AG', 'Ramos R', 'Ceráin AL', 'Peñuelas I', 'Irache JM', 'Gamazo C']",2017,66,7,J Med Microbiol,"Pastor Y, et al.

28650995,Septins restrict inflammation and protect zebrafish larvae from Shigella infection.,"Shigella flexneri, a Gram-negative enteroinvasive pathogen, causes inflammatory destruction of the human intestinal epithelium. Infection by S. flexneri has been well-studied in vitro and is a paradigm for bacterial interactions with the host immune system. Recent work has revealed that components of the cytoskeleton have important functions in innate immunity and inflammation control. Septins, highly conserved cytoskeletal proteins, have emerged as key players in innate immunity to bacterial infection, yet septin function in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we use S. flexneri infection of zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae to study in vivo the role of septins in inflammation and infection control. We found that depletion of Sept15 or Sept7b, zebrafish orthologs of human SEPT7, significantly increased host susceptibility to bacterial infection. Live-cell imaging of Sept15-depleted larvae revealed increasing bacterial burdens and a failure of neutrophils to control infection. Strikingly, Sept15-depleted larvae present significantly increased activity of Caspase-1 and more cell death upon S. flexneri infection. Dampening of the inflammatory response with anakinra, an antagonist of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), counteracts Sept15 deficiency in vivo by protecting zebrafish from hyper-inflammation and S. flexneri infection. These findings highlight a new role for septins in host defence against bacterial infection, and suggest that septin dysfunction may be an underlying factor in cases of hyper-inflammation.","['Mazon-Moya MJ', 'Willis AR', 'Torraca V', 'Boucontet L', 'Shenoy AR', 'Colucci-Guyon E', 'Mostowy S']",2017,13,6,PLoS Pathog,"Mazon-Moya MJ, et al.

28643490,Characterization of Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase Genes of Shigella flexneri Isolates With Fosfomycin Resistance From Patients in China.,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of fosfomycin resistance and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes is a serious threat to public health and a new challenge in shigellosis treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify fosfomycin resistance and characterize β-lactamase genes in fos-carrying isolates of Shigella flexneri from patients in China.
METHODS: A total of 263 S. flexneri isolates were collected from 34 hospitals in the Anhui Province of China during September 2012-September 2015 and screened for fosA3, fosA, and fosC2 by PCR amplification and sequencing. The fos-carrying isolates were then screened for β-lactamase genes. The clonal relationships between fosA3-carrying isolates, the transmissibility of fosfomycin resistance, replicon types of plasmids carrying fosfomycin resistance genes and other associated resistance genes were investigated.
RESULTS: Twenty-five of the 263 isolates (9.5%) showed resistance to fosfomycin, and 18 (6.8%) were positive for fosA3. None of the isolates was positive for fosA or fosC2. Seventeen of the isolates carrying fosA3 (94%) were CTX-M producers (seven CTX-M-55, five CTX-M-14, and five CTX-M-123), while three (16.7%) were TEM producers (TEM-1).Sixteen (88.9%) fosA3-carrying isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance. The replicon types of the 13 fosA3-carrying plasmids were IncF (n=13), IncHI2 (n=3), IncIl-Ir (n=2), and IncN (n=1).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that fosA3 could spread through plasmids in S. flexneri isolates, along with the bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM), which facilitate its quick dispersal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CTX-M-123-type ESBLs in S. flexneri isolates from patients in China.","['Liu Y', 'Cheng Y', 'Yang H', 'Hu L', 'Cheng J', 'Ye Y', 'Li J']",2017,37,5,Ann Lab Med,"Liu Y, et al.

28637484,Seasonal and geographical distribution of bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) and associated climate risk factors in Kon Tam Province in Vietnam from 1999 to 2013.,"BACKGROUND: Bacillary dysentery (BD) is an acute bacterial infection of the intestine caused by Shigella spp., with clinical symptoms ranging from fever to bloody diarrhoea to abdominal cramps to tenesmus. In Vietnam, enteric bacterial pathogens are an important cause of diarrhoea and most cases in children under 5 years of age are due to Shigella strains. The serogroups S. flexneri and S. sonnei are considered to be the most common. The main objective of this study was to, for the first time, assess the seasonal patterns and geographic distribution of BD in Vietnam, and to determine the climate risk factors associated with the incidence of BD in Kon Tum Province, where the highest rate of bacillary dysentery was observed from 1999 to 2013.
METHODS: The seasonal patterns and geographic distribution of BD was assessed in Vietnam using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess. In addition, negative binomial regression models were used to determine the climate risk factors associated with the incidence of BD in Kon Tum Province, from 1999 to 2013.
RESULTS: Overall, incidence rates of BD have slightly decreased over time (except for an extremely high incidence in 2012 in the north of Vietnam). The central regions (north/south central coast and central highlands) had relatively high incidence rates, whereas the northwest/east and Red River Delta regions had low incidence rates. Overall, seasonal plots showed a high peak in the mid-rainy reason and a second smaller peak in the early or late rainy season. The incidence rates significantly increased between May and October (""wet season"") across the country. In Kon Tum Province, temperature, humidity, and precipitation were found to be positively associated with the incidence of BD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insights into the seasonal patterns and geographic distribution of BD in Vietnam and its associated climate risk factors in Kon Tum Province. This study may help clinicians and the general public to better understand the timings of outbreaks and therefore equip them with the knowledge to plan better interventions (such as improving water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions) during peak seasons. This can, in turn, prevent or reduce outbreaks and onwards transmission during an outbreak.","['Lee HS', 'Ha Hoang TT', 'Pham-Duc P', 'Lee M', 'Grace D', 'Phung DC', 'Thuc VM', 'Nguyen-Viet H']",2017,6,1,Infect Dis Poverty,"Lee HS, et al.

Although S. flexneri has been highly prevalent in low-income countries, global development has brought an increase in S. sonnei at the expense of S. flexneri. However, the mechanisms behind this shift are not understood. Here we report that S. sonnei, but not S. flexneri, encodes a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that provides a competitive advantage in the gut. S. sonnei competes against E. coli and S. flexneri in mixed cultures, but this advantage is reduced in T6SS mutant strains. In addition, S. sonnei can persist as well as outcompete E. coli and S. flexneri in mice in a T6SS-dependent manner. These findings suggest that S. sonnei has a competitive advantage over S. flexneri and potentially explain the increasing global prevalence of S. sonnei.","['Anderson MC', 'Vonaesch P', 'Saffarian A', 'Marteyn BS', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2017,21,6,Cell Host Microbe,"Anderson MC, et al.

This study aimed to characterise the antimicrobial resistance patterns, molecular subtypes, and integron types and resistance gene cassettes in S. sonnei from Jiangsu Province, China.
METHODS: In total, 340 S. sonnei were collected in 2002-2011 throughout Jiangsu Province. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR amplification of integrons, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing of cassette regions were performed.
RESULTS: Resistance rates to ampicillin (67.7%), nalidixic acid (75.2%), tetracycline (73.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (68.7%) remained high. Strains from Centre and South Jiangsu showed higher resistance and multiresistance rates compared with the North. PFGE analysis indicated that large-scale clonal transmission among different cities occurred several times during 10 years. Among all strains, 55.9% (190/340) harboured class 1 integrons, 80.3% (273/340) harboured class 2 integrons and 49.4% (168/340) harboured an atypical class 1 integron. Resistance rates to nine antimicrobials in the class 1 integron-positive group were significantly higher than in the negative group (P<0.05). Seven different gene cassettes were detected in class 1 integrons. The most prevalent type was aacA4-cmlA1 (114/286). Class 2 integrons carried the gene cassette array dfrA1-sat1-aadA1, and the atypical class 1 integron carried bla
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing antimicrobial resistance and significant clonal transmission of S. sonnei circulating in Jiangsu were closely related to the high prevalence of integrons and gene cassettes.

28605848,"Projected burden of disease for bacillary dysentery due to flood events in Guangxi, China.","Many researchers have been studying the influence of floods on intestinal infection in recent years. This study aimed to project the future disease burden of bacillary dysentery associated with floods in Guangxi, China. Relying on the longitudinal data, a generalized additive mixed model was applied to quantify the relationship between the monthly morbidity of bacillary dysentery and floods with two severity levels from 2004 to 2010, controlling for other meteorological variables. Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) was used as the measure of the burden of bacillary dysentery in the future of Guangxi, China. According to the generalized additive mixed model, the relative risks (RR) of moderate and severe floods on the morbidity of bacillary dysentery were 1.17 (95% CI: 1.03-1.33) and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.14-1.70), respectively. The regression analysis also indicated that the flood duration was negatively associated with the morbidity of bacillary dysentery (with RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.90). Considering the effects of floods only, compared with the YLDs in 2010, increasing flood events may lead to a 4.0% increase in the YLDs for bacillary dysentery by 2020, 2100, 0.0% by 2050, and an 8.0% increase by 2030 in Guangxi, if other factors remain constant. Considering all potential changes include floods, temperature and population size, the YLDs for bacillary dysentery may increase by up to 16.0% by 2020, 20.0% by 2030, 2050, and 0.0% by 2100, compared to that in 2010 under the moderate flood scenario; Under the severe flood scenario, the YLDs for bacillary dysentery may increase by up to 16.0% by 2020, 20.0% by 2030, 2050, and 4.0% by 2100.","['Liu X', 'Liu Z', 'Ding G', 'Jiang B']",2017,601-602,,Sci Total Environ,"Liu X, et al.

METHODS: WGS data from 341 isolates of S. sonnei isolated between June 2015 and January 2016 were mapped to genes known to be associated with phenotypic AMR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on all viable isolates (n = 335).
RESULTS: Fifteen of 335 isolates had a discrepancy between phenotypic and genotypic testing for 1 of the 10 antimicrobial classes tested, equating to 15 (0.45%) discordant results out of a possible 3350 isolate/antimicrobial combinations. All 15 mismatched results were genotypically resistant but phenotypically susceptible. Eleven of the 15 discrepancies were observed in streptomycin resistance profiles. The most common resistance profile was trimethoprim, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and streptomycin, occurring in 97 (28.4%) isolates. Resistances to ciprofloxacin and the third-generation cephalosporins, not detected in England and Wales prior to 2002, were identified in 18.2% and 12% of isolates, respectively. Three hundred and four (89.1%) isolates were MDR. There was no significant association between any of the AMR determinants tested and recent foreign travel in male or female cases. The number of isolates of S. sonnei harbouring blaTEM-1 and ermB/mphA was significantly higher in men who reported no recent travel outside the UK.

28583306,Developing and utilizing controlled human models of infection.,"The controlled human infection model (CHIM) to assess the efficacy of vaccines against Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) has several unique features that could significantly enhance the ability to test candidate vaccines. Despite increasing interest in these models, questions remain as to how to best incorporate them into vaccine development and how to maximize results. We designed a workshop focused on CHIM as part of the Vaccines Against Shigella and ETEC (VASE) Conference. The workshop, using the World Café method, focused on; clinical outcomes, nonclinical outcomes and model standardization. Researchers with a variety of expertise and experience rotated through each focus area and discussed relevant sub-topics. The results of these discussions were presented and questions posed to guide future workshops. Clinical endpoint discussions focused on the need for harmonized definitions; optimized attack rates; difficulties of sample collection and a need for non-stool based endpoints. Nonclinical discussions centered on evolving omics-based opportunities, host predictors of susceptibility and novel characterizations of the immune response. Model standardization focused on the value of shared procedures across institutions for clinical and non-clinical endpoints as well as for strain preparation and administration and subject selection. Participants agreed CHIMs for Shigella and ETEC vaccine development could accelerate vaccine development of a promising candidate; however, it was also appreciated that variability in the model and our limited understand of the host-pathogen interaction may yield results that could negatively impact a suitable candidate. Future workshops on CHIM are needed to ensure the optimal application of these models moving forward.","['Porter CK', 'Louis Bourgeois A', 'Frenck RW', 'Prouty M', 'Maier N', 'Riddle MS']",2017,35,49 Pt A,Vaccine,"Porter CK, et al.

The treatment of shigellosis mostly requires antibiotics. However, the increase of multidrug resistance along with emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase and ciprofloxacin resistance among Shigella spp. has challenged the situation. This study was conducted to determine the distribution of species and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Shigella species isolated from stool specimen among children less than 5 years of age in Nepal.

28536105,TRAPPC13 modulates autophagy and the response to Golgi stress.,"Tether complexes play important roles in endocytic and exocytic trafficking of lipids and proteins. In yeast, the multisubunit transport protein particle (TRAPP) tether regulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport and is also implicated in autophagy. In addition, the TRAPP complex acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ypt1, which is homologous to human Rab1a and Rab1b. Here, we show that human TRAPPC13 and other TRAPP subunits are critically involved in the survival response to several Golgi-disrupting agents. Loss of TRAPPC13 partially preserves the secretory pathway and viability in response to brefeldin A, in a manner that is dependent on ARF1 and the large GEF GBF1, and concomitant with reduced caspase activation and ER stress marker induction. TRAPPC13 depletion reduces Rab1a and Rab1b activity, impairs autophagy and leads to increased infectivity to the pathogenic bacterium ","['Ramírez-Peinado S', 'Ignashkova TI', 'van Raam BJ', 'Baumann J', 'Sennott EL', 'Gendarme M', 'Lindemann RK', 'Starnbach MN', 'Reiling JH']",2017,130,14,J Cell Sci,"Ramírez-Peinado S, et al.

28526638,Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella and Shigella spp. among children with gastroenteritis in an Iranian referral hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Gastroenteritis is one of the leading cause of illnesses through the world, especially in developing countries.Salmonella and Shigella infections are considered as the main public health problems in children. The aim of this study was to detect the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella and Shigella spp. among children with gastroenteritis in an Iranian referral hospital.
METHODS: During April 2013 to April 2014, all medical records of children with gastroenteritis admitted to a pediatric medical center were evaluated. Positive stool cultures of children were evaluated and frequency of Salmonella and Shigella spp. and their antimicrobial susceptibility were detected.
RESULTS: In this study, 676 patients with the mean age of 24.94 months were enrolled. Eighty-eight (42%) Salmonella spp., 85 (40%) Shigella spp., 33 (16%) E. coli and 5(2%) candida albicans were isolated from 211 positive stool cultures. Among 85 Shigella spp. isolates, S. sonnei, S. flexneri and other Shigella spp. were isolated from 39 (46%) isolates, 36(42%) and 10(12%), respectively. Among 88 isolated Salmonella spp., 36 (41%) isolates were Salmonella Serogroup D, 26 (30%) were Salmonella Serogroup B, 20 (23%) isolates were Salmonella Serogroup C and 6 (7%) were other Salmonella spp. isolates. Thirty-eight percent of Salmonella serogroup B were resistant to nalidixic acid, while higher frequency of nalidixic acid resistant was found in Salmonella serogroup C and Salmonella serogroup D. The higher frequency of ampicillin resistant was found in Shigella spp. than Salmonella spp. High frequency of cefotaxime resistant was seen in S. sonei and S. flexneri (77% and 56%, respectively), whereas more than 90% of Salmonella serogroup B, C and D were susceptible to this antibiotic.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Shigella and Salmonella serogroups can be considered as important etiological agents of acute diarrhea in children. Since the prevalence of antibiotic resistance is increasing in recent years in Iran, further studies on the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in these species is highly recommended.","['Mahmoudi S', 'Pourakbari B', 'Moradzadeh M', 'Eshaghi H', 'Ramezani A', 'Haghi Ashtiani MT', 'Keshavarz Valian S', 'Mamishi S']",2017,109,,Microb Pathog,"Mahmoudi S, et al.

28522322,Imaging macropinosomes during Shigella infections.,"Macropinocytosis is the uptake of extracellular fluid within vesicles of varying size that takes place during numerous cellular processes in a large variety of cells. A growing number of pathogens, including viruses, parasites, and bacteria are known to induce macropinocytosis during their entry into targeted host cells. We have recently discovered that the human enteroinvasive, bacterial pathogen Shigella causes in situ macropinosome formation during its entry into epithelial cells. These infection-associated macropinosomes are not generated to ingest the bacteria, but are instead involved in Shigella's intracellular niche formation. They make contacts with the phagocytosed shigellae to promote vacuolar membrane rupture and their cytosolic release. Here, we provide an overview of the different imaging approaches that are currently used to analyze macropinocytosis during infectious processes with a focus on Shigella entry. We detail the advantages and disadvantages of genetically encoded reporters as well as chemical probes to trace fluid phase uptake. In addition, we report how such reporters can be combined with ultrastructural approaches for correlative light electron microscopy either in thin sections or within large volumes. The combined imaging techniques introduced here provide a detailed characterization of macropinosomes during bacterial entry, which, apart from Shigella, are relevant for numerous other ones, including Salmonella, Brucella or Mycobacteria.","['Kühn S', 'Lopez-Montero N', 'Chang YY', 'Sartori-Rupp A', 'Enninga J']",2017,127,,Methods,"Kühn S, et al.

In China, the species most frequently responsible for shigellosis is Shigella flexneri. S. flexneri remains largely unexplored from a genomic standpoint and is still described using a vocabulary based on biochemical and serological properties. Moreover, increasing numbers of ESBL-producing Shigella strains have been isolated from clinical samples. Despite this, only a few cases of ESBL-producing Shigella have been described in China.

28453565,Risk factors and outcome of Shigella encephalopathy in Bangladeshi children.,"BACKGROUND: Although, Shigella encephalopathy, a serious extra-intestinal complication of shigellosis, significantly increases the risks of death, data are very limited on predicting factors particularly related to electrolyte profiles in children below five years of age with Shigella encephalopathy. Our objective was to determine the clinical as well as laboratory predicting factors and outcome of children with Shigella encephalopathy.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this unmatched case-control design, children aged 2-59 months having a positive stool culture for Shigella and who had their serum electrolytes been done from July 2012 to June 2015 were studied. Children with Shigella encephalopathy, defined as having abnormal mentation, constituted the cases, and those without encephalopathy constituted the controls. During the study period, we identified a total of 541 children less than five years of age, who had Shigella in their stool culture. Only 139 children fulfilled the study criteria and among them 69 were cases and 70 were controls. The cases more often had fatal outcome compared to the controls (7% vs. 0%, P = 0.02). In logistic regression analysis, the cases were independently associated with shorter duration (1.2 ± 0.4 days) of diarrhea prior to admission, dehydrating diarrhea, sepsis and hyponatremia (p<0.05 for all). Among 139 Shigella isolates, S. flexneri (88/139, 63%) and S. sonnei(34/139, 24%) were the dominant species. S. dysenteriae was not isolated throughout the study period. S.sonnei was more frequently isolated from the cases (24/69, 35%) than the controls (10/70, 14%), whereas the isolation of S. flexneri was comparable between the groups (40/69, 58% vs 48/70, 69%). A total of 94 (67.6%) isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, 84 (60.4%) to ciprofloxacin, 66/138 (48%) to ampicillin, 5 (3.5%) to ceftriaxone, 17 (12.2%) to mecillinum and 35 (25%) to azithromycin.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The case-fatality-rate was significantly higher among the children with Shigella encephalopathy compared to those without encephalopathy. Early identification and aggressive management of simple risk factors for Shigella encephalopathy may help to reduce morbidity and deaths in such children especially in resource-limited settings.","['Afroze F', 'Ahmed T', 'Sarmin M', 'Smsb Shahid A', 'Shahunja KM', 'Shahrin L', 'Chisti MJ']",2017,11,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Afroze F, et al.

However, the mechanism by which S.dysenteriae infection regulates proinflammatory cytokines during intestinal inflammation is still obscure. In this study, we evaluated whether the interaction of β-catenin and NF-κB regulates proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8 by modulating GSK-3β activity during S.dysenteriae infection in rat ileal loop model. Here we demonstrated that S.dysenteriae infection stimulate β-catenin degradation which in turn decreased the association between NF-κB and β-catenin. Also, we showed that S.dysenteriae infection increased GSK-3β kinase activity which in turn phosphorylates β-catenin for its degradation by ubiquitination and upregulates IL-8 through NF-κB activation thereby leading to inflammation. Thus these findings revealed the role of β-catenin/ NF-κB and GSK-3β in modulating the inflammatory response during bacterial infection and also showed that β-catenin acts as a critical regulator of inflammation.","['Gopal A', 'Chidambaram IS', 'Devaraj N', 'Devaraj H']",2017,12,4,PLoS One,"Gopal A, et al.

28394930,Analysis of host microRNA function uncovers a role for miR-29b-2-5p in Shigella capture by filopodia.,"MicroRNAs play an important role in the interplay between bacterial pathogens and host cells, participating as host defense mechanisms, as well as exploited by bacteria to subvert host cellular functions. Here, we show that microRNAs modulate infection by Shigella flexneri, a major causative agent of bacillary dysentery in humans. Specifically, we characterize the dual regulatory role of miR-29b-2-5p during infection, showing that this microRNA strongly favors Shigella infection by promoting both bacterial binding to host cells and intracellular replication. Using a combination of transcriptome analysis and targeted high-content RNAi screening, we identify UNC5C as a direct target of miR-29b-2-5p and show its pivotal role in the modulation of Shigella binding to host cells. MiR-29b-2-5p, through repression of UNC5C, strongly enhances filopodia formation thus increasing Shigella capture and promoting bacterial invasion. The increase of filopodia formation mediated by miR-29b-2-5p is dependent on RhoF and Cdc42 Rho-GTPases. Interestingly, the levels of miR-29b-2-5p, but not of other mature microRNAs from the same precursor, are decreased upon Shigella replication at late times post-infection, through degradation of the mature microRNA by the exonuclease PNPT1. While the relatively high basal levels of miR-29b-2-5p at the start of infection ensure efficient Shigella capture by host cell filopodia, dampening of miR-29b-2-5p levels later during infection may constitute a bacterial strategy to favor a balanced intracellular replication to avoid premature cell death and favor dissemination to neighboring cells, or alternatively, part of the host response to counteract Shigella infection. Overall, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of microRNAs, and in particular miR-29b-2-5p, in the interaction of Shigella with host cells.","['Sunkavalli U', 'Aguilar C', 'Silva RJ', 'Sharan M', 'Cruz AR', 'Tawk C', 'Maudet C', 'Mano M', 'Eulalio A']",2017,13,4,PLoS Pathog,"Sunkavalli U, et al.

28389276,Whole genome sequencing of Shigella sonnei through PulseNet Latin America and Caribbean: advancing global surveillance of foodborne illnesses.,"OBJECTIVES: Shigella sonnei is a globally important diarrhoeal pathogen tracked through the surveillance network PulseNet Latin America and Caribbean (PNLA&C), which participates in PulseNet International. PNLA&C laboratories use common molecular techniques to track pathogens causing foodborne illness. We aimed to demonstrate the possibility and advantages of transitioning to whole genome sequencing (WGS) for surveillance within existing networks across a continent where S. sonnei is endemic.
METHODS: We applied WGS to representative archive isolates of S. sonnei (n = 323) from laboratories in nine PNLA&C countries to generate a regional phylogenomic reference for S. sonnei and put this in the global context. We used this reference to contextualise 16 S. sonnei from three Argentinian outbreaks, using locally generated sequence data. Assembled genome sequences were used to predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes and identify AMR determinants.
RESULTS: S. sonnei isolates clustered in five Latin American sublineages in the global phylogeny, with many (46%, 149 of 323) belonging to previously undescribed sublineages. Predicted multidrug resistance was common (77%, 249 of 323), and clinically relevant differences in AMR were found among sublineages. The regional overview showed that Argentinian outbreak isolates belonged to distinct sublineages and had different epidemiologic origins.
CONCLUSIONS: Latin America contains novel genetic diversity of S. sonnei that is relevant on a global scale and commonly exhibits multidrug resistance. Retrospective passive surveillance with WGS has utility for informing treatment, identifying regionally epidemic sublineages and providing a framework for interpretation of prospective, locally sequenced outbreaks.","['Baker KS', 'Campos J', 'Pichel M', 'Della Gaspera A', 'Duarte-Martínez F', 'Campos-Chacón E', 'Bolaños-Acuña HM', 'Guzmán-Verri C', 'Mather AE', 'Diaz Velasco S', 'Zamudio Rojas ML', 'Forbester JL', 'Connor TR', 'Keddy KH', 'Smith AM', 'López de Delgado EA', 'Angiolillo G', 'Cuaical N', 'Fernández J', 'Aguayo C', 'Morales Aguilar M', 'Valenzuela C', 'Morales Medrano AJ', 'Sirok A', 'Weiler Gustafson N', 'Diaz Guevara PL', 'Montaño LA', 'Perez E', 'Thomson NR']",2017,23,11,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Baker KS, et al.

This study describes the molecular characterization of three colicinogenic plasmids designated as pSSE3, pSSE and pSSE2, each with a molecular size of ∼6 kb, identified in clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei. Sequence analysis revealed that pSSE and pSSE2 shared extensive sequence homology with each other and with Escherichia coli E-type colicinogenic plasmids. The plasmid pSSE3 lacked an additional gene imparting immunity to colicin E8, a unique feature not observed in any of the previously reported sequences of colicin E3 plasmids. Incomplete digestion of colicinogenic plasmids by restriction endonucleases, metachromatic staining with acridine orange and presence of single stranded initiation (ssi) region confirmed the coexistence of ssDNA along with dsDNA. Plasmid copy number as determined by real-time PCR was found to be about 20. Transmission electron microscopy revealed DNA impairment in test bacteria after colicin exposure. We hypothesize that S. sonnei has acquired E-group colicin plasmids from its close relative E. coli, with their sequences undergoing subtle changes depending on the cohabitation in the same milieu.","['Calcuttawala F', 'Hariharan C', 'Pazhani GP', 'Saha DR', 'Ramamurthy T']",2017,364,7,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Calcuttawala F, et al.

However, evidence about the risk of bacillary dysentery attributable to ambient temperature under climate change scenarios is scarce. We examined the attributable fraction (AF) of temperature-related bacillary dysentery in urban and rural Hefei, China during 2006-2012 and projected its shifting pattern under climate change scenarios using a distributed lag non-linear model. The risk of bacillary dysentery increased with the temperature rise above a threshold (18·4 °C), and the temperature effects appeared to be acute. The proportion of bacillary dysentery attributable to hot temperatures was 18·74% (95 empirical confidence interval (eCI): 8·36-27·44%).

Under the climate change scenarios alone (1-4 °C rise), the AF from extreme hot temperatures (>31·2 °C) would rise greatly accompanied by the relatively stable AF from moderate hot temperatures (18·4-31·2 °C).

28283139,Incidences of Waterborne and Foodborne Diseases After Meteorologic Disasters in South Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Climate change could increase the number of regions affected by meteorologic disasters. Meteorologic disasters can increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks, including waterborne and foodborne diseases. Although many outbreaks of waterborne diseases after single disasters have been analyzed, there have not been sufficient studies reporting comprehensive analyses of cases occurring during long-term surveillance after multiple disasters, which could provide evidence of whether meteorologic disasters cause infectious disease outbreaks.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the nationwide short-term changes in waterborne and foodborne disease incidences after a meteorologic disaster.
METHODS: We analyzed cases after all 65 floods and typhoons between 2001 and 2009 using the Korean National Emergency Management Agency's reports. Based on these data, we compared the weekly incidences of Vibrio vulnificus septicemia (VVS), shigellosis, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever before, during, and after the disasters, using multivariate Poisson regression models. We also analyzed the interactions between disaster characteristics and the relative risk of each disease.
FINDINGS: Compared with predisaster incidences, the incidences of VVS and shigellosis were 2.49-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.47-4.22) and 3.10-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.21-7.92) higher, respectively, the second week after the disaster. The incidences of VVS and shigellosis peaked the second week postdisaster and subsequently decreased. The risks of typhoid and paratyphoid fever did not significantly increase throughout the 4 weeks postdisaster. The daily average precipitation interacted with VVS and shigellosis incidences, whereas disaster type only interacted with VVS incidence patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of VVS and shigellosis were associated with meteorologic disasters, and disaster characteristics were associated with the disease incidence patterns postdisaster. These findings provide important comprehensive evidence to develop and support policies for managing and protecting public health after meteorologic disasters.","['Na W', 'Lee KE', 'Myung HN', 'Jo SN', 'Jang JY']",2016,82,5,Ann Glob Health,"Na W, et al.

This study was carried out to find the extent and nature of the emerging resistance in north part of Karnataka, India, and surrounding region with huge population, and also focused on the molecular mechanism of development of resistance against different generations of fluoroquinolones and explored the diversity of restriction endonucleases; we also tried to establish the significance of reduced minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values.
METHODS: A total of 32 multidrug-resistant Shigella species (isolated from infants' stools) were subjected to MICs of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates done by both broth dilution and E-test method. The genes implicated in resistance to fluoroquinolone generations ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and gatifloxacin (gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE) were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and restriction digestion analysis of PCR product were performed using PvuI and HaeII enzymes.
FINDINGS: Fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella species (n = 32) comprising S dysenteriae, S flexneri, and S sonnei were selected for MIC; 90.6% (29/32), 93.75% (30/32), and 93.75% (30/32) of isolates were ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and gatifloxacin resistant and showed the MIC range from 4-128 μg/mL. The PCR amplification results were positive for all species and asserted the presence of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and pare and sizes of the amplified products. The restriction banding patterns of amplified resistant genes were employed to detect differences among the Shigella species.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that the genetic basis and its characterization of fluoroquinolone resistance in Shigella isolates was considered for the common resistant genes, namely, gyrA, gyrB, parC, and pare, and had mutations at position 83 of gyrA and at position 80 of parC of the quinolone-resistant determining regions and associated molecular mechanism.

28277944,The Galleria mellonella larvae as an in vivo model for evaluation of Shigella virulence.,"Shigella spp. causing bacterial diarrhea and dysentery are human enteroinvasive bacterial pathogens that are orally transmitted through contaminated food and water and cause bacillary dysentery. Although natural Shigella infections are restricted to humans and primates, several smaller animal models are used to analyze individual steps in pathogenesis. No animal model fully duplicates the human response and sustaining the models requires expensive animals, costly maintenance of animal facilities, veterinary services and approved animal protocols. This study proposes the development of the caterpillar larvae of Galleria mellonella as a simple, inexpensive, informative, and rapid in-vivo model for evaluating virulence and the interaction of Shigella with cells of the insect innate immunity. Virulent Shigella injected through the forelegs causes larvae death. The mortality rates were dependent on the Shigella strain, the infectious dose, and the presence of the virulence plasmid. Wild-type S. flexneri 2a, persisted and replicated within the larvae, resulting in haemocyte cell death, whereas plasmid-cured mutants were rapidly cleared. Histology of the infected larvae in conjunction with fluorescence, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy indicate that S. flexneri reside within a vacuole of the insect haemocytes that ultrastructurally resembles vacuoles described in studies with mouse and human macrophage cell lines. Some of these bacteria-laden vacuoles had double-membranes characteristic of autophagosomes.

28218003,"Virulotyping of Shigella spp. isolated from pediatric patients in Tehran, Iran.","Shigellosis is a considerable infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality among children worldwide. In this survey the prevalence of four important virulence genes including ial, ipaH, set1A, and set1B were investigated among Shigella strains and the related gene profiles identified in the present investigation, stool specimens were collected from children who were referred to two hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The samples were collected during 3 years (2008-2010) from children who were suspected to shigellosis. Shigella spp. were identified throughout microbiological and serological tests and then subjected to PCR for virulotyping. Shigella sonnei was ranking first (65.5%) followed by Shigella flexneri (25.9%), Shigella boydii (6.9%), and Shigella dysenteriae (1.7%). The ial gene was the most frequent virulence gene among isolated bacterial strains and was followed by ipaH, set1B, and set1A. S. flexneri possessed all of the studied virulence genes (ial 65.51%, ipaH 58.62%, set1A 12.07%, and set1B 22.41%). Moreover, the pattern of virulence gene profiles including ial, ial-ipaH, ial-ipaH-set1B, and ial-ipaH-set1B-set1A was identified for isolated Shigella spp. strains. The pattern of virulence genes is changed in isolated strains of Shigella in this study.

Baise, a city in Guangxi Province (China) had experienced several floods between 2004 and 2012 due to heavy and constant precipitation. This study aimed to examine the relationship between floods and the incidence of bacillary dysentery in Baise. A mixed generalized additive model and Spearman correlation were applied to analyze the relationship between monthly incidence of bacillary dysentery and 14 flood events with two severity levels. Data collected from 2004 to 2010 were utilized to estimate the parameters, whereas data from 2011 to 2012 were used to validate the model. There were in total 9255 cases of bacillary dysentery included in our analyses. According to the mixed generalized additive model, the relative risks (RR) of moderate and severe floods on the incidence of bacillary dysentery were 1.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-1.69) and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.61-1.97), respectively. The regression analysis also indicated that the flood duration was negatively associated with the incidence of bacillary dysentery (with RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.40-0.86). Therfore, this research suggests that floods exert a significant part in enhancing the risk of bacillary dysentery in Baise. Moreover, severe floods have a higher proportional contribution to the incidence of bacillary dysentery than moderate floods. In addition, short-term floods may contribute more to the incidence of bacillary dysentery than a long-term flood. The findings from this research will provide more evidence to reduce health risks related to floods.","['Liu X', 'Liu Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Jiang B']",2017,14,2,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Liu X, et al.

The shigellosis was uncommon in Shenzhen and no related outbreak was reported during the last 5 years. An epidemiological investigation was conducted and the children and nursing workers in SCWI were surveyed for gastrointestinal symptoms; 28 of children reported having a diarrheal illness. Rectal swabs or fecal specimens from 14 case patients and 24 nursing workers or cook, as well as 17 swabs from implicated items were collected and examined for Shigella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Salmonella. Susceptibility testing and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed on the Shigella isolates. The multiple-antibiotic-resistant Shigella flexneri 2a was isolated from 10 ill children aged less than 5 years. The source of the outbreak was most likely a new welfare child transferred from an institute in another county and the secondary transmission of the illness was facilitated by the limited activity space and the cohabiting of ill and well residents. The outbreak was controlled after quarantine of ill residents, introduction of new antibiotics and the improvements of hygienic condition. This was the first time that shigellosis outbreak was reported at such settings in Shenzhen and the results of this investigation underscored the need for adequate precautions to prevent secondary transmission of multiple-antibiotic-resistant strain in the welfare setting.","['Shen H', 'Chen J', 'Xu Y', 'Lai Z', 'Zhang J', 'Yang H', 'Li Y', 'Jiang M', 'Ye Y', 'Bai X']",2017,10,6,J Infect Public Health,"Shen H, et al.

28165371,Protection against Shiga Toxins.,"Shiga toxins consist of an A-moiety and five B-moieties able to bind the neutral glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) on the cell surface. To intoxicate cells efficiently, the toxin A-moiety has to be cleaved by furin and transported retrogradely to the Golgi apparatus and to the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzymatically active part of the A-moiety is then translocated to the cytosol, where it inhibits protein synthesis and in some cell types induces apoptosis. Protection of cells can be provided either by inhibiting binding of the toxin to cells or by interfering with any of the subsequent steps required for its toxic effect. In this article we provide a brief overview of the interaction of Shiga toxins with cells, describe some compounds and conditions found to protect cells against Shiga toxins, and discuss whether they might also provide protection in animals and humans.","['Kavaliauskiene S', 'Dyve Lingelem AB', 'Skotland T', 'Sandvig K']",2017,9,2,Toxins (Basel),"Kavaliauskiene S, et al.

28152988,"Identification and antimicrobial resistance patterns of bacterial enteropathogens from children aged 0-59 months at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia: a prospective cross sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Bacterial diarrhoeal disease is among the most common causes of mortality and morbidity in children 0-59 months at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. However, most cases are treated empirically without the knowledge of aetiological agents or antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The aim of this study was, therefore, to identify bacterial causes of diarrhoea and determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in stool specimens obtained from the children at the hospital.
METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional study involved children aged 0-59 months presenting with diarrhoea at paediatrics wards at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, from January to May 2016. Stool samples were cultured on standard media for enteropathogenic bacteria, and identified further by biochemical tests. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used for characterization of diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on antibiotics that are commonly prescribed at the hospital using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method, which was performed using the Clinical Laboratory Standards International guidelines.
RESULTS: Of the 271 stool samples analysed Vibrio cholerae 01 subtype and Ogawa serotype was the most commonly detected pathogen (40.8%), followed by Salmonella species (25.5%), diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (18%), Shigella species (14.4%) and Campylobacter species (3.5%). The majority of the bacterial pathogens were resistant to two or more drugs tested, with ampicillin and co-trimoxazole being the most ineffective drugs. All diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli isolates were extended spectrum β-lactamase producers.
CONCLUSION: Five different groups of bacterial pathogens were isolated from the stool specimens, and the majority of these organisms were multidrug resistant. These data calls for urgent revision of the current empiric treatment of diarrhoea in children using ampicillin and co-trimoxazole, and emphasizes the need for continuous antimicrobial surveillance as well as the implementation of prevention programmes for childhood diarrhoea.","['Chiyangi H', 'Muma JB', 'Malama S', 'Manyahi J', 'Abade A', 'Kwenda G', 'Matee MI']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Chiyangi H, et al.

28116567,[Point-of-care tests for the rapid diagnosis of shigellosis].,"Worldwide, it is estimated that 140 million people suffer from shigellosis annually. The traditional identification of Shigella spp. by culture lacks sensitivity. Rapid diagnosis of shigellosis is important because it allows to engage appropriate antimicrobial treatment that shortens the duration and severity of the illness and reduces microbial carriage, thus the spread of infection in the community. Onestep immunochromatographic dipstick tests have been successfully developed at Institut Pasteur for Shigella spp., Shigella flexneri 2a, Shigella sonnei, and Shigella dysenteriae 1. The present work describes the evaluation of these four rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) that addressed the issue of rapid diagnosis of Shigella diarrhea and dysentery testing from bacterial cultures, stools, and rectal swabs which is usually how the specimen is often collected or received from the field or from remote settings. The evaluations have been performed in Chile, Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, Djibouti, Vietnam, India, and France, in dispensaries, in emergency room, on the field, in public health laboratories, and by the French Army. The dipstick method used requires minimal technical skill, and the test can be read between 5 and 15 minutes. Stool cultures and the immunochromatographic test showed concordant results in the comparative studies when RDT for S. sonnei was tested in Chile, Vietnam, India, and France; specificity (Sp) was 96% and sensitivity (Se) was 100%. When RDT for S. flexneri 2a was tested in Vietnam, Se was 91.5% and Sp was 99.2%. In Chile, Se was 83.3% and Sp was 100%. When RDT for S. dysenteriae 1 was tested in India, Vietnam, Senegal, and France by laboratory technicians and in Democratic Republic of Congo by a field technician, the Sp was 98.7% and the Se was 91.7%. In Chile, the initial finding for a simple RDT to diagnose Shigella spp. demonstrates its promising potential to become a powerful tool for case management and epidemiological surveys. Additionally, the dipsticks can be stored at room temperature in a humidity-proof plastic bag, making them easily transportable. Considering the potential impact these RDT have for the clinical management of the disease and for epidemiological studies, industrialization of these tests is in progress.","['Haddar C', 'Begaud E', 'Maslin J', 'Germani Y']",2017,110,1,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,"Haddar C, et al.

28036349,Characterization and Genomic Study of the Novel Bacteriophage HY01 Infecting Both Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Shigella flexneri: Potential as a Biocontrol Agent in Food.,"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Shigella flexneri are well-known food-borne pathogens causing severe food poisoning at low infectious doses. Bacteriophages have been approved for food applications by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been suggested as natural food preservatives to control specific food-borne pathogens. To develop a novel natural food preservative against E. coli O157:H7 and S. flexneri, a new bacteriophage needs to be isolated and characterized.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bacteriophage HY01 infecting both E. coli O157:H7 and S. flexneri was isolated from a swine fecal sample. HY01 belongs to the family Myoviridae and is stable under various temperature and pH conditions. One-step growth curve analysis showed relatively short eclipse and latent periods as well as large burst size. The 167-kb genome sequence of HY01 was sequenced, and a comparative genome analysis with T4 for non-O157:H7 E. coli suggests that the receptor recognition protein of HY01 plays an important role in determination of host recognition and specificity. In addition, food applications using edible cabbage were conducted with two E. coli O157:H7 strains (ATCC 43890 and ATCC 43895), showing that treatment with HY01 inhibits these clinical and food isolates with >2 log reductions in bacterial load during the first 2 h of incubation.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HY01 can inhibit both E. coli O157:H7 and S. flexneri with large burst size and stability under stress conditions. The ability of HY01 to infect both E. coli O157:H7 and S. flexneri may be derived from the presence of two different host specificity-associated tail genes in the genome. Food applications revealed the specific ability of HY01 to inhibit both pathogens in food, suggesting its potential as a novel biocontrol agent or novel natural food preservative against E. coli O157:H7 and potentially S. flexneri.","['Lee H', 'Ku HJ', 'Lee DH', 'Kim YT', 'Shin H', 'Ryu S', 'Lee JH']",2016,11,12,PLoS One,"Lee H, et al.

27974538,Identification of Escherichia coli and Shigella Species from Whole-Genome Sequences.,"Escherichia coli and Shigella species are closely related and genetically constitute the same species. Differentiating between these two pathogens and accurately identifying the four species of Shigella are therefore challenging. The organism-specific bioinformatics whole-genome sequencing (WGS) typing pipelines at Public Health England are dependent on the initial identification of the bacterial species by use of a kmer-based approach. Of the 1,982 Escherichia coli and Shigella sp. isolates analyzed in this study, 1,957 (98.4%) had concordant results by both traditional biochemistry and serology (TB&S) and the kmer identification (ID) derived from the WGS data. Of the 25 mismatches identified, 10 were enteroinvasive E. coli isolates that were misidentified as Shigella flexneri or S. boydii by the kmer ID, and 8 were S. flexneri isolates misidentified by TB&S as S. boydii due to nonfunctional S. flexneri O antigen biosynthesis genes. Analysis of the population structure based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data derived from the WGS data showed that the remaining discrepant results belonged to clonal complex 288 (CC288), comprising both S. boydii and S. dysenteriae strains. Mismatches between the TB&S and kmer ID results were explained by the close phylogenetic relationship between the two species and were resolved with reference to the MLST data. Shigella can be differentiated from E. coli and accurately identified to the species level by use of kmer comparisons and MLST. Analysis of the WGS data provided explanations for the discordant results between TB&S and WGS data, revealed the true phylogenetic relationships between different species of Shigella, and identified emerging pathoadapted lineages.","['Chattaway MA', 'Schaefer U', 'Tewolde R', 'Dallman TJ', 'Jenkins C']",2017,55,2,J Clin Microbiol,"Chattaway MA, et al.

27927680,Functional and Antigen-Specific Serum Antibody Levels as Correlates of Protection against Shigellosis in a Controlled Human Challenge Study.,"Shigella is an important cause of diarrheal disease in young children living in developing countries. No approved vaccines are available, and the development of vaccine candidates has been hindered by the lack of firm immunological correlates of protection, among other reasons. To address this gap in knowledge, we established quantitative assays to measure Shigella-specific serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) and opsonophagocytic killing antibody (OPKA) activities and investigated their potential association with protection against disease in humans. SBA, OPKA, and Ipa-, VirG (IscA)-, and Shigella flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide-specific serum IgG titers were determined in adult volunteers who received Shigella vaccine candidate EcSf2a-2 and in unvaccinated controls, all of whom were challenged with virulent Shigella flexneri 2a. Prechallenge antibody titers were compared with disease severity after challenge. SBA and OPKA, as well as IpaB- and VirG-specific IgG, significantly correlated with reduced illness. SBA and OPKA assays were also used to evaluate the immunogenicity of leading live attenuated vaccine candidates Shigella CVD 1204 and CVD 1208S in humans. A single oral immunization with CVD 1204 or CVD 1208S resulted in SBA seroconversion rates of 71% and 47% and OPKA seroconversion rates of 57% and 35%, respectively. Higher functional antibody responses were induced by CVD 1204, which is consistent with its lower attenuation. This is the first demonstration of SBA, OPKA, and IpaB- and VirG-specific IgG levels as potential serological correlates of protection against shigellosis in humans. These results warrant further studies to establish their capacity to predict protective immunity and vaccine efficacy.","['Shimanovich AA', 'Buskirk AD', 'Heine SJ', 'Blackwelder WC', 'Wahid R', 'Kotloff KL', 'Pasetti MF']",2017,24,2,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Shimanovich AA, et al.

Molecular study can help to determine the outbreak of this bacterium. Multiple-Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) will largely influence the public health field by introducing newer, faster, safer, and effective procedure for typing of microorganisms. A total of fifty shigella isolates were collected between November 2012 to October 2013 in Tehran, Iran. The strains were identified base on biochemical and molecular tests. Subsequently, all shigella species were confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Virulence factors were detected using PCR for ial, set1A, and set1B genes. The strains were genotyped by MLVA typing method. All of the isolates were identified as S. sonnei by biochemical and molecular (PCR) methods. Virulence genes identified among all isolates included ial, and set1A genes in 20% and 5% of all isolates, respectively. On the other hand, none of isolates were positive for set1B gene. Using MLVA method 22 MLVA types were identified. MLVA type 11 accounted for 32% of isolates. Moreover, all virulence factors were only detected in MLVA type 11, 9, 5, 4. The results of this study indicate that the Iranian 2012-2013 S. sonnei outbreak isolates were virulent and clonaly related. Furthermore, this study showed that MLVA can be used as useful method for S. sonnei genotyping in epidemiological investigations.","['Bakhshi B', 'Bayat B', 'Lari AR']",2017,102,,Microb Pathog,"Bakhshi B, et al.

To investigate the effect of IS600 on the expression of CRISPR associated gene cse2 in Shigella.
METHODS: CRISPR loci, CRISPR associated gene cse2, drug-resistant genes and virulent genes were detected by PCR in 33 Shigella strains; Trypan Blue counting test was used to detect bacterial virulence; Real-time PCR was used to detect relative mRNA expression of cse2; susceptibilities of Shigella strains were tested by agar diffusion method. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between CRISPR loci and drug-resistant genes, virulent genes. The effect of the IS600 on the expression of CRISPR associated gene cse2 was investigated.
RESULTS: The mortality of Hela cells infected by Shigella with CRISPR1 loci was significantly lower (P<0.05) than those infected by Shigella without CRISPR1. The mRNA expression level of cse2 in group with IS600 was significantly (P<0.05) lower than that in group without IS600.
CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR loci were widely present in Shigella. Shigella without CRISPR1 has a higher pathogenicity.

Consumption of microbiologically contaminated water leads to diseases such as amoebiasis, cholera, shigellosis, typhoid, and viral infections leading to gastroenteritis and hepatitis B. The present investigation deals with the development of effective method to capture and eliminate microbial contamination of water and improve the quality of water and thus decreasing the contaminated waterborne infections. Over the last decade, numerous biomedical applications have emerged for magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) specifically iron oxide nanoparticles. For the first time, we have explored functionalized cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (NPs) for capture and detection of pathogens. The captured bacterial were separated by using simple magnet. To begin with, the prepared NPs were confirmed for biocompatibility study and further used for their ability to detect the bacteria in solution. For this, standard bacterial concentrations were prepared and used to confirm the ability of these particles to capture and detect the bacteria. The effect of particle concentration, time, and pH has been studied, and the respective results have been discussed. It is observed that the presence of amine group on the surface of NPs shows nonspecific affinity and capability to capture Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The possible underlying mechanism is discussed in the present manuscript. Based upon this, the present material can be considered for large-scale bacteria capture in water purification application.","['Bohara RA', 'Throat ND', 'Mulla NA', 'Pawar SH']",2017,182,2,Appl Biochem Biotechnol,"Bohara RA, et al.

CASE REPORT: We describe a case of pneumonia in an immunocompetent, previously healthy middle-aged man from Switzerland without relevant travel history which was presumably caused by Shigella sonnei. He was originally admitted for suspected lung cancer. The clinical picture was remarkable as the patient presented with cough and purulent sputum production, but otherwise no classical signs of pneumonia. Furthermore, there was no diarrhoeal episode in the recent history. It is an uncommon presentation of shigellosis in an immunocompetent person without underlying severe predisposing conditions.
CONCLUSION: We report an unusual identification of S. sonnei as the only identified pathogen from respiratory specimens, which we therefore consider the most likely etiology of this subacute atypical pneumonia. This case illustrates the importance of a complete work-up in a patient whose suspected malignancy could not be proven.","['Nahid H', 'Staub D', 'Hächler H', 'Albrich WC']",2017,45,2,Infection,"Nahid H, et al.

On the other hand, unsafe food handling and processing can serve as a vehicle for the transmission of a variety of disease causing agents. The risk of food getting contaminated depends largely on the health status of the food handlers, their personal hygiene, knowledge and practice of food hygiene. Food borne diseases are therefore a public health problem in developed and developing countries which is also true for Ethiopia. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and associated risk factors of Shigella and Salmonella among food handlers in Arba Minch University, South Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted among food handlers in Arba Minch University students' cafeteria from April- June, 2015. Structured questionnaire was used to collect socio demographic data and associated risk factors. Stool sample was collected and examined for pathogens following standard procedures. Biochemical tests were done to identify the species of pathogens and sensitivity test was done using Kirby- Baur disk diffusion technique.
RESULTS: A total of 376 food handlers were enrolled in the study with the response rate of 100% for data collected by questionnaire. About 7.4% were aged less than 20 years with majority (63.3%) lay in the working age group of 21-35 years. However, a total of 345 food handlers participated for stool examination of whom, stool cultures revealed 6.9% of Salmonella and 3% Shigella isolates. Finger nail status (AOR=0.033), hand washing practice after toilet (AOR= 0.006) and touching food with bare hands (AOR= p < 0.001) were independent predictors of infectious enteric diseases among the food handlers. All isolated pathogens were resistant to amoxicillin (100%), followed by clarithromycin (41%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (35%).
CONCLUSION: The present study showed high prevalence of enteropathogens among the study participants. The study also revealed poor personal hygiene like poor practice of hand washing. Therefore, pre placement, in service training on personal and food hygiene should be provided to all food handlers with regular sanitary inspection to improve adherence of food handlers to personal hygiene and food safety practices.","['Mama M', 'Alemu G']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Mama M and Alemu G.

Three hundred and ninety-two Shigella isolates, including 134 Shigella flexneri and 258 Shigella sonnei isolates, were examined for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and zone sizes to azithromycin by broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods, respectively. The MICs were compared with corresponding zone diameters to find whether there was uniformity between both tests. Twelve macrolide-resistant genes located on mobile elements were determined for the DSA isolates by PCR, and chromosomal efflux pump activity was analyzed using Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide inhibition test and quantitative real-time PCR. Shigella isolates displayed MICs of 0.125-512 μg/ml and zone sizes of 6-26 mm against azithromycin. There were 80 (20.4%) isolates to be DSA. No significant difference was found between the DSA rates of S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolates (p = 0.052). There was an intimate relativity between MICs and zone diameters (p < 0.001). Only the plasmid-borne mphA conferring high-level DSA was detected in 55.0% (44/80) DSA-Shigella isolates. This study highlighted the prevalence of DSA-Shigella and mphA in the region studied.

To understand the role of the JNK-MAPK pathway during bacterial infection, an in vivo model organism Caenorhabditis elegans was used. In order to check the involvement of the JNK-MAPK pathway, the survival rate of C. elegans wild type (WT), and JNK-MAPK pathway mutant worms' upon exposure to selective Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, was studied. Among the pathogens, Shigella flexneri M9OT was found to efficiently colonize inside the WT and JNK-MAPK pathway mutant worms. qPCR studies had suggested that the above pathway-specific genes kgb-2 and jnk-1 were prominently responsible for the immune response elicited by the host during the M9OT infection. In addition, daf-16, which is a major transcription factor of the insulin/insulin growth factor-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, was also found to be involved during the host response. Crosstalk between IIS and JNK-MAPK pathways has probably been involved in the activation of the host immune system, which consequently leads to lifespan extension. Furthermore, it is also observed that daf-16 activation by JNK-MAPK pathway leads to antimicrobial response, by activating lys-7 expression. These findings suggest that JNK-MAPK is not the sole pathway that enhances the immunity of the host. Nonetheless, the IIS pathway bridges the JNK-MAPK pathway that influences in protecting the host in counter to the M9OT infection.","['Marudhupandiyan S', 'Balamurugan K']",2017,65,3,Immunol Res,Marudhupandiyan S and Balamurugan K.

27763815,Diverted recycling-Shigella subversion of Rabs.,"Small GTPases of the Rab protein family control intracellular vesicular trafficking to allow their communication and maintenance. It is a common strategy for intracellular bacteria to exploit these pathways to shape their respective niches for survival. The subversion of Rabs for the generation of an intracellular environment favoring the pathogen has been described almost exclusively for intracellular bacteria that reside within bacterial containing vacuoles (BCVs). However, less is known about Rab subversion for bacteria that rupture the BCV to reach the host cytoplasm. Here, we provide recent examples of Rab targeting by both groups of intracellular bacteria with a special focus on Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery. Shigella recruits Rab11, the hallmark of the perinuclear recycling compartment to in situ formed macropinosomes at the entry foci via the bacterial effector IpgD. This leads to efficient BCV rupture and cytosolic escape. We discuss the concept of diverted recycling through host Rab GTPases that emerges as a novel pathogen strategy.","['López-Montero N', 'Enninga J']",2018,9,5,Small GTPases,López-Montero N and Enninga J.

27783408,Update on: Shigella new serogroups/serotypes and their antimicrobial resistance.,"Shigellosis represents a major burden of disease in developing countries. A low infectious dose allows the disease to be spread effectively. Although shigellosis is mostly a self-limiting disease, antibiotics are recommended to reduce deaths, disease symptoms and organism-shedding time. However, in India, antimicrobial resistance among the genus Shigella is more common than among any other enteric bacteria. Notably, new serotypes or subserotypes in Shigella are reported from various parts of the world. Identification of new subserotypes of Shigella spp. is becoming a major issue as these strains are nontypeable by conventional serotyping. The commercially available antisera may not cover all possible epitopes of the O lipopolysaccharide antigen of Shigella serotypes. Therefore, molecular methods which most closely approach the resolution of full serotyping are necessary to identify such strains. In addition, the knowledge of a prevalent serotype in various geographic regions may assist in formulating strategies such as the development of a vaccine to prevent infection especially when the immunity to disease is serotype specific, and to understand the disease burden caused by new Shigella serotypes.","['Muthuirulandi Sethuvel DP', 'Devanga Ragupathi NK', 'Anandan S', 'Veeraraghavan B']",2017,64,1,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Muthuirulandi Sethuvel DP, et al.

Sixteen Medical Microbiological Laboratories (MMLs) participated. MMLs were interviewed about their diagnostic methods and a sample panel, consisting of DNA-extracts and spiked stool samples with different concentrations of Shigella flexneri, was provided to each MML. The results of the trial showed an enormous variety in culture-dependent and molecular diagnostic techniques currently used among MMLs. Despite the various molecular procedures, 15 out of 16 MMLs were able to detect Shigella species or EIEC in all the samples provided, showing that the diversity of methods has no effect on the qualitative detection of Shigella flexneri. In contrast to semi quantitative analysis, the minimum and maximum values per sample differed by approximately five threshold cycles (Ct-value) between the MMLs included in the study. This indicates that defining a uniform Ct-value cut-off for notification to health authorities is not advisable.","['van den Beld MJC', 'Friedrich AW', 'van Zanten E', 'Reubsaet FAG', 'Kooistra-Smid MAMD', 'Rossen JWA', 'participating Medical Microbiological Laboratories']",2016,131,,J Microbiol Methods,"van den Beld MJC, et al.

27774718,A review of the public health management of shigellosis in Australia in the era of culture-independent diagnostic testing.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the national case definition for shigellosis following the introduction of culture independent diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories and provide evidence to reform jurisdictional public health practices for the management shigellosis., .
METHODS: A review of all Australian jurisdictional public health guidelines for shigellosis was conducted. Victorian 2014 shigellosis data were analysed: demographics and risk factors for cases identified by conventional culture or culture-independent diagnostic methods were described.
RESULTS: There was considerable variation in reporting of cases to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) by the eight Australian jurisdictions, with an array of classifications based on diagnostic testing methodologies. Analysis of Victorian 2014 shigellosis data found that culture positive cases were more likely to have reported men who have sex with men (MSM) as a risk factor than PCR positive only cases (p<0.0001) and less likely to have reported overseas travel during their incubation period (p<0.0001). Over a 10-year period (2005 to 2014), only two of 86 cases who were employed in high-risk occupations had ongoing positive faecal cultures after appropriate treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The national surveillance case definition for shigellosis should be reviewed to facilitate standardised reporting across Australia. All jurisdictions must consider the public health significance of PCR positive only results in their surveillance risk assessments to inform management of shigellosis cases.","['Tai AY', 'Easton M', 'Encena J', 'Rotty J', 'Valcanis M', 'Howden BP', 'Slota-Kan S', 'Gregory J']",2016,40,6,Aust N Z J Public Health,"Tai AY, et al.

Shigella spp. harbours the epithelial cells of the human colon to infect the host and spread the disease. We analyzed the response of B-1a cells, the major component of the mucosal immune system to porin of Shigella dysenteriae type 1. We show that porin while proliferating B-1a cells, deplete Siglec-G, the inhibitory molecule present on B-1a cells. Adjuvanticity of porin has been shown to govern innate signaling for promoting host adaptive immune response.

Two hundred ninety strains were in vitro tested for resistance to 15 antimicrobial agents. The presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) was demonstrated by a variety of specialized tests. For comparison, a collection of 28 strains submitted by the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) ""Enteric Infections"" at the National Center of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (NCIPD), Sofia, was also tested for the production of ESBLs. In isolates, phenotypically demonstrated as ESBL producers, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of the genes bla-CTX-M, bla-SHV, and bla-TEM was performed. Among the 290 tested isolates, only two- Salmonella serotype Livingstone and Shigella flexneri-were phenotypically proven to be ESBL producers. Only 4 strains from the collection of 28, submitted from the NRL ""Intestinal Infections"" in NCIPD, Sofia, were phenotypically confirmed as ESBL producers. The presence of the bla-CTX-M gene was detected in all of the tested strains (4 from NRL, NCIPD, Sofia, and 2 from the University Hospital St. George, Plovdiv), the bla-SHV gene only in strain S.

27655911,Stable expression of Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 O-antigen genes integrated into the chromosome of live Salmonella oral vaccine vector Ty21a.,"Typhoid fever and shigellosis cause high morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet no anti-Shigella vaccine is currently available. However, to protect against typhoid fever, an approved vaccine, based on the attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi strain Ty21a is available. We have investigated Ty21a as a live oral vaccine vector for expression of heterologous foreign antigens to protect against other diseases (e.g. shigellosis, anthrax, and plague). Shigella LPS is a potent vaccine antigen for serotype-specific protection against Shigellae. We previously reported the construction of a Ty21a derivative expressing S. sonnei O-antigen by insertion of a large (∼12.5 kb) operon comprising the S. sonnei O-antigen biosynthetic genes into a targeted site within the Ty21a chromosome using modified λ red recombineering methods. In the current study, S. dysenteriae 1 O-antigen biosynthetic genes from 2 separate genetic loci, rfp and rfb were assembled and inserted into the Ty21a chromosome by λ red-mediated recombineering to construct strain Ty21a-Sd. To obtain a high level of heterologous LPS expression, the native upstream promoter was replaced with the constitutive lpp promoter, which resulted in Ty21a-Sdl with enhanced heterologous LPS expression. Both Ty21a-Sd and Ty21a-Sdl elicited significant serum antibody responses in mice against both Ty21a and this heterologous Shigella LPS, and conferred protection against virulent S. dysenteriae 1 challenge. This work represents progress toward the goal of a safe and effective vaccine against Shigella.","['Dharmasena MN', 'Osorio M', 'Filipova S', 'Marsh C', 'Stibitz S', 'Kopecko DJ']",2016,74,8,Pathog Dis,"Dharmasena MN, et al.

A total of 624 S. flexneri strains isolated between 2001 and 2011 in Jiangsu Province of China were analysed for their fluoroquinolone susceptibility. The quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE were amplified and sequenced. In general, 90.5 % of S. flexneri exhibited resistance to nalidixic acid. The mean norfloxacin resistance rate was 22.4 % during the 11 years from 2001 to 2011 (6.4 % from 2001 to 2005 and 36.8 % from 2006 to 2011). Sequencing of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes of all S. flexneri isolates showed that the mutation rate was as high as 93.9 %. In addition, 91.8 % and 92.3 % of S. flexneri harboured mutations in gyrA and parC, respectively. About 35.2 % of S. flexneri isolates susceptible to nalidixic acid contained mutations.

27600526,"Enteric pathogens and factors associated with acute bloody diarrhoea, Kenya.","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is the major cause of bloody diarrhoea worldwide and is endemic in most developing countries. In Kenya, bloody diarrhoea is reported weekly as part of priority diseases under Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System (IDSR) in the Ministry of Health.
METHODS: We conducted a case control study with 805 participants (284 cases and 521 controls) between January and December 2012 in Kilifi and Nairobi Counties. Kilifi County is largely a rural population whereas Nairobi County is largely urban. A case was defined as a person of any age who presented to outpatient clinic with acute diarrhoea with visible blood in the stool in six selected health facilities in the two counties within the study period. A control was defined as a healthy person of similar age group and sex with the case and lived in the neighbourhood of the case.
RESULTS: The main presenting clinical features for bloody diarrhoea cases were; abdominal pain (69 %), mucous in stool (61 %), abdominal discomfort (54 %) and anorexia (50 %). Pathogen isolation rate was 40.5 % with bacterial and protozoal pathogens accounting for 28.2 % and 12.3 % respectively. Shigella was the most prevalent bacterial pathogen isolated in 23.6 % of the cases while Entamoeba histolytica was the most prevalent protozoal pathogen isolated in 10.2 % of the cases. On binary logistic regression, three variables were found to be independently and significantly associated with acute bloody diarrhoea at 5 % significance level; storage of drinking water separate from water for other use (OR = 0.41, 95 % CI 0.20-0.87, p = 0.021), washing hands after last defecation (OR = 0.24, 95 % CI 0.08-.076, p = 0.015) and presence of coliforms in main source water (OR = 2.56, CI 1.21-5.4, p = 0.014). Rainfall and temperature had strong positive correlation with bloody diarrhoea.
CONCLUSION: The main etiologic agents for bloody diarrhoea were Shigella and E. histolytica. Good personal hygiene practices such as washing hands after defecation and storing drinking water separate from water for other use were found to be the key protective factors for the disease while presence of coliform in main water source was found to be a risk factor. Implementation of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions is therefore key in prevention and control of bloody diarrhoea.","['Njuguna C', 'Njeru I', 'Mgamb E', 'Langat D', 'Makokha A', 'Ongore D', 'Mathenge E', 'Kariuki S']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Njuguna C, et al.

27591952,Development of recombinant vaccine candidate molecule against Shigella infection.,"Shigellosis is an acute bacillary diarrheal disease caused by the gram negative bacillus Shigella. The existence of multiple Shigella serotypes and their growing resistance to antibiotics stress the urgent need for the development of vaccine that is protective across all serotypes. Shigella's IpaB antigen is involved in translocon pore formation, promotes bacterial invasion and induces apoptosis in macrophages. S. Typhi GroEL (Hsp 60) is the immunodominant antigen inducing both arms of immunity and has been explored as adjuvant in this study. The present study evaluates the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant IpaB domain-GroEL fusion protein in mice against lethal Shigella infection. The IpaB domain and GroEL genes were fused using overlap extension PCR and cloned in pRSETA expression vector. Fused gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 cells and the resulting 90 KDa fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Intranasal (i.n.) immunization of mice with fusion protein increased the IgG and IgA antibody titers as compared to the group immunized with IpaB and GroEL and control PBS immunized group. Also IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies induced in fusion protein immunized mice were higher than co-immunized group. Significant increase in lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine levels (IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10), indicates induction of both Th1 and Th2 immune responses in both immunized groups. Immunization with fusion protein protected 90-95% of mice whereas 80-85% survivability was observed in co-immunized group against lethal challenge with S. flexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei. Passive immunization conferred 60-70% protection in mice against all these Shigella species. Organ burden and histopathology studies also revealed significant decrease in lung infection as compared to the co-immunized group. Since IpaB is the conserved dominant molecule in all Shigella species, this study will lead to an ideal platform for the development of safe, efficacious and cost-effective recombinant vaccine against Shigella serotypes.","['Chitradevi STS', 'Kaur G', 'Sivaramakrishna U', 'Singh D', 'Bansal A']",2016,34,44,Vaccine,"Chitradevi STS, et al.

Bioconjugation technology, exploited here for an Shigella flexneri 2a candidate vaccine, offers a novel and potentially cost-effective way to develop and produce vaccines against a major pathogen of global health importance. Flexyn2a, a novel S. flexneri 2a bioconjugate vaccine made of the polysaccharide component of the S. flexneri 2a O-antigen, conjugated to the exotoxin protein A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (EPA), was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity among healthy adults in a single-blind, phase I study with a staggered randomization approach. Thirty subjects (12 receiving 10 μg Flexyn2a, 12 receiving Flexyn2a with aluminum adjuvant, and 6 receiving placebo) were administered two injections 4 weeks apart and were followed for 168 days. Flexyn2a was well-tolerated, independently of the adjuvant and number of injections. The Flexyn2a vaccine elicited statistically significant S. flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific humoral responses at all time points postimmunization in all groups that received the vaccine. Elicited serum antibodies were functional, as evidenced by bactericidal activity against S. flexneri 2a. The bioconjugate candidate vaccine Flexyn2a has a satisfactory safety profile and elicited a robust humoral response to S. flexneri 2a LPS with or without inclusion of an adjuvant.

It is a global concern although it predominates in developing countries. These are Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii and Shigella sonnei. Drug resistance by Shigella species is another headache of the world. Therefore; this study aimed to review distribution of Shigella Serogroups and their antimicrobial patterns carried out in Africa, Asia and South America.
METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify published studies between January 2001 and December 2014. Published studies were identified using an initial search of the MEDLINE/Index Medicus Database, PubMed, Project Management Consultant, Google Scholar, Science Direct, BioMed Central and Index Copernicus.
RESULTS: Shigella flexneri was isolated predominately from seven studies in four African countries and eight studies in five Asian countries. The countries in which eligible studies carried out were Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea and Ghana in Africa and Pakistan, Iran, China, Nepal and India in Asia. S. sonnei was isolated predominately from one study in Africa, four in Asia and two South America. The countries in which eligible studies carried out were Ethiopia from Africa, Thailand, Vietnam and Iran from Asia and Chile and Trinidad from South America. S. dysentery was also reported majorly from one eligible study in Egypt and one in Nepal. S. boydii did not score highest prevalence in any one of the eligible studies. Three studies from Africa, five from Asia and one from South America were reviewed for antimicrobial resistance patterns of Shigella Serogroups. In all the regions, Ampicillin developed highly resistance to almost all the Serogroups of Shigella whereas all the strains were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of Shigella Serogroups in the selected three regions is different. The domination of S. flexneri is observed in Africa and Asia although S. sonnei in South America is dominant. Shigella Serogroups are becoming resistance to the commonly prescribed antimicrobial drugs in developing countries.","['Kahsay AG', 'Muthupandian S']",2016,9,1,BMC Res Notes,"Kahsay AG and Muthupandian S.

27572446,Global phylogeography and evolutionary history of Shigella dysenteriae type 1.,"Together with plague, smallpox and typhus, epidemics of dysentery have been a major scourge of human populations for centuries(1). A previous genomic study concluded that Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1), the epidemic dysentery bacillus, emerged and spread worldwide after the First World War, with no clear pattern of transmission(2). This is not consistent with the massive cyclic dysentery epidemics reported in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries(1,3,4) and the first isolation of Sd1 in Japan in 1897(5). Here, we report a whole-genome analysis of 331 Sd1 isolates from around the world, collected between 1915 and 2011, providing us with unprecedented insight into the historical spread of this pathogen. We show here that Sd1 has existed since at least the eighteenth century and that it swept the globe at the end of the nineteenth century, diversifying into distinct lineages associated with the First World War, Second World War and various conflicts or natural disasters across Africa, Asia and Central America. We also provide a unique historical perspective on the evolution of antibiotic resistance over a 100-year period, beginning decades before the antibiotic era, and identify a prevalent multiple antibiotic-resistant lineage in South Asia that was transmitted in several waves to Africa, where it caused severe outbreaks of disease.","['Njamkepo E', 'Fawal N', 'Tran-Dien A', 'Hawkey J', 'Strockbine N', 'Jenkins C', 'Talukder KA', 'Bercion R', 'Kuleshov K', 'Kolínská R', 'Russell JE', 'Kaftyreva L', 'Accou-Demartin M', 'Karas A', 'Vandenberg O', 'Mather AE', 'Mason CJ', 'Page AJ', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Bizet C', 'Gamian A', 'Carle I', 'Sow AG', 'Bouchier C', 'Wester AL', 'Lejay-Collin M', 'Fonkoua MC', 'Le Hello S', 'Blaser MJ', 'Jernberg C', 'Ruckly C', 'Mérens A', 'Page AL', 'Aslett M', 'Roggentin P', 'Fruth A', 'Denamur E', 'Venkatesan M', 'Bercovier H', 'Bodhidatta L', 'Chiou CS', 'Clermont D', 'Colonna B', 'Egorova S', 'Pazhani GP', 'Ezernitchi AV', 'Guigon G', 'Harris SR', 'Izumiya H', 'Korzeniowska-Kowal A', 'Lutyńska A', 'Gouali M', 'Grimont F', 'Langendorf C', 'Marejková M', 'Peterson LA', 'Perez-Perez G', 'Ngandjio A', 'Podkolzin A', 'Souche E', 'Makarova M', 'Shipulin GA', 'Ye C', 'Žemličková H', 'Herpay M', 'Grimont PA', 'Parkhill J', 'Sansonetti P', 'Holt KE', 'Brisse S', 'Thomson NR', 'Weill FX']",2016,1,,Nat Microbiol,"Njamkepo E, et al.

27528086,The importance of integrons for development and propagation of resistance in Shigella: the case of Latin America.,"In Latin America, the disease burden of shigellosis is found to coexist with the rapid and rampant spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. The molecular basis of antibiotic resistance lies within genetic elements such as plasmids, transposons, integrons, genomic islands, etc., which are found in the bacterial genome. Integrons are known to acquire, exchange, and express genes within gene cassettes and it is hypothesized that they play a significant role in the transmission of multidrug resistance genes in several Gram-negative bacteria including Shigella. A few studies have described antibiotic resistance genes and integrons among multidrug resistant Shigella isolates found in Latin America. For example, in Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica and Peru, class 1 and class 2 integrons have been detected among multidrug resistant strains of Shigella; this phenomenon is more frequently observed in S. flexneri isolates that are resistant to trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. The gene cassette sul2, which is frequently detected in Shigella strains resistant to the sulfonamides, suggests that the sulfonamide-resistant phenotype can be explained by the presence of the sul2 genes independent of the integron class detected. It is to be noted that sul3 was negative in all isolates analyzed in these studies. The high frequency of sulfonamide (as encoded by sul2) and trimethoprim resistance is likely to be a result of the recurrent use of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole as a popular regimen for the treatment of shigellosis. The observed resistance profiles of Shigella strains confirm that ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are ineffective as therapeutic options. In-depth information regarding antibiotic resistance mechanism in this pathogen is needed in order to develop suitable intervention strategies. There is a pressing need for regional and local antimicrobial resistance profiling of Shigella to be included as a part of the public health strategy.","['Barrantes K', 'Achí R']",2016,47,4,Braz J Microbiol,Barrantes K and Achí R.

Children with MSD were enrolled along with controls matched for age, gender, and neighborhood. Pooled, age-stratified conditional logistic regression models were applied to evaluate the association of Aeromonas infection controlling for coinfecting pathogens and sociodemographic variables. A pooled, age-stratified, multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to identify risk factors associated with Aeromonas positivity in MSD cases. A total of 12,110 cases and 17,291 matched controls were enrolled over a period of 48 months. Aeromonas was identified as a significant pathogen in 736 cases of MSD in Pakistan and Bangladesh (22.2%). Aeromonas remained a significant pathogen even after adjustment for the presence of other pathogens and sociodemographic factors. Odds ratio (OR) for Aeromonas were higher in the presence of Shigella (matched OR: 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-20.2). Cases of Aeromonas were likely to present with dysentery, particularly in the 0-11 months (OR: 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0) and 12-23 months (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.5) age group. The odds of Aeromonas increased with increasing degree of stunting, being highest for severe stunting (OR: 10.1, 95% CI: 3.6-28.9).

The analysis investigated data sets from 11,079 diseased German travelers (cases) returning from Latin America (1,986), Africa (3,387), and Asia (5,706), and from 714 healthy Germans who had not recently traveled (controls). The proportions of elevated values of CRP (> 0.5 mg/dL) were significantly larger among cases (44.3%) than among controls (20.7%). Among cases, this proportion was largest among males (49.2%) in comparison to females (39.9%), among travelers with short travel duration of 1-14 days (49.6%) in comparison to travelers with a travel duration of > 180 days (30.8%), and with travel destination in Africa (47.0%) in comparison to Asia (44.2%) and Latin America (39.9%), among all-inclusive travelers (47.4%) in comparison to business travelers (46.7%) and backpackers (44.1%), and among patients presenting with fever (70.9%) and arthralgia (54.3%). The study identified various imported IDs with significantly larger proportions of elevated values of CRP including viral (cytomegalovirus infection [94.7%], influenza [88.9%], infectious mononucleosis [71.8%]), bacterial (typhoid fever [100%], paratyphoid fever [92.9%], shigellosis [76.8%], rickettsiosis [74.2%], Salmonella enteritis [71.3%], Campylobacter infection [68.7%]), and protozoan (vivax malaria [100%], ovale malaria [100%], falciparum malaria [95.4%], noninvasive Entamoeba infection [65.9%]) IDs.

In order to understand the emergence of S.sonnei with respect to ciprofloxacin resistance in our patient population, the following study was carried out. Of the 184 Shigella sp. Isolated from 2012 to 2015, 34 S.sonnei which were confirmed by standard methods and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing were selected. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 16/34 quinolone resistant isolates tested ranged from 4micrograms/ml to 16micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, from 16 micrograms/ml to 64 micrograms/ml for ofloxacin and from 16micrograms/ml to 64micrograms/ml for levofloxacin. Sequence determination of the quinolone resistance determining regions of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes showed mutations in GyrA at Gln69/Trp, Phe71/Ser, Ser72/Pro, Met75/Leu, Ser90/Cys, Met94/Leu, His106/Pro, Asn161/His, Thr163/Ala and in ParC at Ala64/Asp. Among the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQRs) targets investigated,qnrB was the most (93.7%) prevalent followed by qnrC (18.7%). None hadqnrA, qnrS and qepA. Two (0.1%) of the isolates harboured theaac(6')-lb gene. Drug accumulation assay detected the presence of efflux pump activity in 9/15 (60%) among ciprofloxacin resistant isolates. All isolates harboured the ipaH gene followed by ial (17.6%), sen (11.7%), set1A&set1B (5.8%) genes. None had stx1 element. PCR for Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequences resulted in 4 unique clusters, of which Type III was the most (44%) dominant but there was no correlation between the ERIC types and the antibiotic resistance pattern or the virulence profile. A documented increase in S.sonnei harbouring the qnrgenes and some unusual genes like set1Aand indicate an ongoing process of horizontal gene transfer. The accumulation of novel mutations in GyrA and ParC in the presence of efflux pump and PMQR genes contributed to the raised MIC to quinolones. These findings are crucial in our understanding of quinolone resistance in these isolates.","['Das A', 'Natarajan M', 'Mandal J']",2016,11,8,PLoS One,"Das A, et al.

27490698,Neutropenia as an Adverse Event following Vaccination: Results from Randomized Clinical Trials in Healthy Adults and Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: In the context of early vaccine trials aimed at evaluating the safety profile of novel vaccines, abnormal haematological values, such as neutropenia, are often reported. It is therefore important to evaluate how these trials should be planned not to miss potentially important safety signals, but also to understand the implications and the clinical relevance.
METHODOLOGY: We report and discuss the results from five clinical trials (two with a new Shigella vaccine in the early stage of clinical development and three with licensed vaccines) where the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were evaluated before and after vaccination. Additionally, we have performed a systematic review of the literature on cases of neutropenia reported during vaccine trials to discuss our results in a more general context.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both in our clinical trials and in the literature review, several cases of neutropenia have been reported, in the first two weeks after vaccination. However, neutropenia was generally transient and had a benign clinical outcome, after vaccination with either multiple novel candidates or well-known licensed vaccines. Additionally, the vaccine recipients with neutropenia frequently had lower baseline ANC than non-neutropenic vaccinees. In many instances neutropenia occurred in subjects of African descent, known to have lower ANC compared to western populations.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to include ANC and other haematological tests in early vaccine trials to identify potential safety signals. Post-vaccination neutropenia is not uncommon, generally transient and clinically benign, but many vaccine trials do not have a sampling schedule that allows its detection. Given ethnic variability in the level of circulating neutrophils, normal ranges taking into account ethnicity should be used for determination of trial inclusion/exclusion criteria and classification of neutropenia related adverse events.

27489797,Emergence of Plasmid-Borne dfrA14 Trimethoprim Resistance Gene in Shigella sonnei.,"The most common mechanism of trimethoprim (TMP)-resistance is the acquisition of dihydrofolate reductase enzyme resistant to this drug. Previous molecular characterization of TMP-genes resistance in Chilean isolates of Shigella sonnei searching for dfrA1 and dfrA8, showed solely the presence of dfrA8 (formerly dhfrIIIc). However, these genetic markers were absent in S. sonnei strains further isolated during an outbreak in 2009. To identify the TMP-resistance gene in these strains, a genomic DNA library from a TMP-resistant (TMP(R)) S. sonnei representative strain for the outbreak was used to clone, select and identify a TMP-resistance marker. The TMP(R) clone was sequenced by primer walking, identifying the presence of the dfrA14 gene in the sul2-strA'-dfrA14-'strA-strB gene arrangement, harbored in a native 6779-bp plasmid. The same plasmid was isolated by transforming with a ~4.2 MDa plasmid extracted from several TMP(R) S. sonnei strains into Escherichia coli. This plasmid, named pABC-3, was present only in dfrA14-positive strains and was homologous to a previously described pCERC-1, but different due to the absence of an 11-bp repetitive unit. The distribution of dfrA1, dfrA8, and dfrA14 TMP-resistance genes was determined in 126 TMP(R) S. sonnei isolates. Most of the strains (96%) carried only one of the three TMP-resistance genes assessed. Thus, all strains obtained during the 2009-outbreak harbored only dfrA14, whereas, dfrA8 was the most abundant gene marker before outbreak and, after the outbreak dfrA1 seems have appeared in circulating strains. According to PFGE, dfrA14-positive strains were clustered in a genetically related group including some dfrA1- and dfrA8-positive strains; meanwhile other genetic group included most of the dfrA8-positive strains. This distribution also correlated with the isolation period, showing a dynamics of trimethoprim genetic markers prevalent in Chilean S. sonnei strains. To our knowledge, dfrA14 gene associated to a small non-conjugative plasmid was detected for the first time in Shigella. Apparently, the strain causing the outbreak must have been introduced, changing drastically the genetic distribution of trimethoprim resistance in Chilean S. sonnei strains.","['Miranda A', 'Ávila B', 'Díaz P', 'Rivas L', 'Bravo K', 'Astudillo J', 'Bueno C', 'Ulloa MT', 'Hermosilla G', 'Del Canto F', 'Salazar JC', 'Toro CS']",2016,6,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Miranda A, et al.

27487999,Shigellosis: Epidemiology in India.,"Shigellosis is one of the major causes of diarrhoea in India. The accurate estimates of morbidity and mortality due to shigellosis are lacking, though it is endemic in the country and has been reported to cause many outbreaks. The limited information available indicates Shigella to be an important food- borne pathogen in India. S. flexneri is the most common species, S. sonnei and non-agglutinable Shigellae seem to be steadily surfacing, while S. dysenteriae has temporarily disappeared from the northern and eastern regions. Antibiotic-resistant strains of different Shigella species and serotypes have emerged all over the world. Especially important is the global emergence of multidrug resistant Shigellae, notably the increasing resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, and also azithromycin. This calls for a continuous and strong surveillance of antibiotic resistance across the country for periodic updation of the local antibiograms. The prevention of shigellosis is desirable as it will substantially reduce the morbidity associated with diarrhoea in the country. Public health measures like provision of safe water and adequate sanitation are of immense importance to reduce the burden of shigellosis, however, the provision of resources to develop such an infrastructure in India is a complex issue and will take time to resolve. Thus, the scientific thrust should be focused towards development of a safe and affordable multivalent vaccine. this review is focused upon the epidemiology, disease burden and the therapeutic challenges of shigellosis in Indian perspective.","['Taneja N', 'Mewara A']",2016,143,5,Indian J Med Res,Taneja N and Mewara A.

27472290,HIV and diarrhoea: what is new?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review examines the changing causes and the investigation of infectious and noninfectious diarrhoea in individuals with HIV.
RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the excellent prognosis conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy, diarrhoea is still common in HIV-positive individuals and is associated with reduced quality of life and survival. There is increasing interest in the importance of Th17 and Th22 T cells in the maintenance of mucosal immunity within the gut, and in the role of the gut microbiome in gut homeostasis. Bacterial causes of HIV-associated diarrhoea continue to be important in resource-poor settings. In other settings, sexually transmitted enteric infections such as lymphogranuloma venereum and shigellosis are increasingly reported in men who have sex with men. HIV increases the risk of such infections and the presence of antimicrobial resistance. Parasitic causes of diarrhoea are more common in individuals with uncontrolled HIV and low CD4 counts. Noninfectious causes of diarrhoea include all classes of antiretroviral therapy, which is under-recognised as a cause of poor treatment adherence. Pancreatic dysfunction is remediable and the diagnostic workup of HIV-related diarrhoea should include faecal elastase measurements. New antimotility agents such as crofelemer may be useful in managing secretory diarrhoea symptoms.
SUMMARY: Clinicians looking after patients with HIV should ask about diarrhoeal symptoms, which are under-reported and may have a remediable infectious or noninfectious cause.","['Logan C', 'Beadsworth MB', 'Beeching NJ']",2016,29,5,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Logan C, et al.

27460806,The Orchestra and Its Maestro: Shigella's Fine-Tuning of the Inflammasome Platforms.,"Shigella spp. are the causative agents of bacillary dysentery, leading to extensive mortality and morbidity worldwide. These facultative intracellular bacteria invade the epithelium of the colon and the rectum, inducing a severe inflammatory response from which the symptoms of the disease originate. Shigella are human pathogens able to manipulate and subvert the innate immune system surveillance. Shigella dampens inflammasome activation in epithelial cells. In infected macrophages, inflammasome activation and IL-1β and IL-18 release lead to massive neutrophil recruitment and greatly contribute to inflammation. Here, we describe how Shigella hijacks and finely tunes inflammasome activation in the different cell populations involved in pathogenesis: epithelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, DCs, and B and T lymphocytes. Shigella emerges as a ""sly"" pathogen that switches on/off the inflammasome mechanisms in order to optimize the interaction with the host and establish a successful infection.","['Hermansson AK', 'Paciello I', 'Bernardini ML']",2016,397,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Hermansson AK, et al.

BACKGROUND: Shigella species are frequent cause of bacterial dysentery worldwide. Previous studies have been reported that S. sonnei and S. flexneri are the most prevalent serogroups in various parts of Iran.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 624 stool samples were randomly collected from patients with diarrhea from June 2013 to August 2014. Biochemical and serological characterizations were performed for identifying Shigella spp. In addition, the multiplex PCR assay was carried out for the detection and differentiation of three pathogenic Shigella spp. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
RESULTS: Fifty six (9%) Shigella strains were isolated from stool samples. The most common species were S. flexneri 31(55.4%), followed by S . sonnei 18(32.1%) and S. boydii 7(12.5%). S. dysentery was not detected in the present study. All the isolates that identified by serological test as Shigella spp. were confirmed by the multiplex PCR method. The highest rate of resistance was observed for ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole antibiotics with 52(92.9%) resistant, followed by tetracycline 44(78.6%) and cefotaxime 33(58.9%). All Shigella isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. A significant relationship was found between the Shigella species and cefotaxime resistance (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: S. flexneri was found as the most prevalent serogroup causing shigellosis. The high rate of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins limits the treatment options available for the management of shigellosis in Kerman, Iran.","['Hosseini Nave H', 'Mansouri S', 'Sadeghi A', 'Moradi M']",2016,9,3,Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,"Hosseini Nave H, et al.

27445336,Identification of a Distinct Substrate-binding Domain in the Bacterial Cysteine Methyltransferase Effectors NleE and OspZ.,"The type III secretion system effector protein NleE from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli plays a key role in the inhibition of NF-κB activation during infection. NleE inactivates the ubiquitin chain binding activity of host proteins TAK1-binding proteins 2 and 3 (TAB2 and TAB3) by modifying the Npl4 zinc finger domain through S-adenosyl methionine-dependent cysteine methylation. Using yeast two-hybrid protein interaction studies, we found that a conserved region between amino acids 34 and 52 of NleE, in particular the motif (49)GITR(52), was critical for TAB2 and TAB3 binding. NleE mutants lacking (49)GITR(52) were unable to methylate TAB3, and wild type NleE but not NleE(49AAAA52) where each of GITR was replaced with alanine restored the ability of an nleE mutant to inhibit IL-8 production during infection. Another NleE target, ZRANB3, also associated with NleE through the (49)GITR(52) motif. Ectopic expression of an N-terminal fragment of NleE (NleE(34-52)) in HeLa cells showed competitive inhibition of wild type NleE in the suppression of IL-8 secretion during enteropathogenic E. coli infection. Similar results were observed for the NleE homologue OspZ from Shigella flexneri 6 that also bound TAB3 through the (49)GITR(52) motif and decreased IL-8 transcription through modification of TAB3. In summary, we have identified a unique substrate-binding motif in NleE and OspZ that is required for the ability to inhibit the host inflammatory response.","['Zhang Y', 'Mühlen S', 'Oates CV', 'Pearson JS', 'Hartland EL']",2016,291,38,J Biol Chem,"Zhang Y, et al.

27436462,"Molecular characterisation of quinolone-resistant Shigella strains isolated in Tehran, Iran.","Over the past few years, the number of Shigella strains resistant to nalidixic acid has increased and has made the selection of effective antimicrobial therapy more difficult. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of quinolone resistance in Shigella strains. Shigella strains isolated from 1100 diarrhoeal patients in Tehran, Iran, were assessed for their susceptibility to nalidixic acid prior to PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis of their quinolone resistance genes. Among 73 Shigella strains isolated, 23 (31.5%) were resistant to nalidixic acid. The most common Shigella spp. was Shigella sonnei (54; 74.0%). Of the 23 quinolone-resistant isolates, 4 (17.4%) (including 2 Shigella flexneri, 1 S. sonnei and 1 Shigella boydii) contained the qnrS gene. However, none of the isolates harboured qnrA or qnrB genes. PCR-RFLP analysis of gyrA showed a mutation profile in two nalidixic acid-resistant strains, including one S. sonnei and one S. flexneri. Sequencing of mutant gyrA genes revealed a point mutation at position 83, resulting in the replacement of serine by leucine. In conclusion, molecular mechanisms of resistance to quinolones were identified in 6 of 23 Shigella isolates. Other possible mechanisms of resistance should also be investigated for better characterisation of quinolone-resistant Shigella isolates.","['Ranjbar R', 'Behnood V', 'Memariani H', 'Najafi A', 'Moghbeli M', 'Mammina C']",2016,5,,J Glob Antimicrob Resist,"Ranjbar R, et al.

27431270,Complex secondary metabolites from Ludwigia leptocarpa with potent antibacterial and antioxidant activities.,"Diarrhea continues to be one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among infants and children in developing countries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of extracts and compounds from Ludwigia leptocarpa, a plant traditionally used for its vermifugal, anti-dysenteric, and antimicrobial properties. A methanol extract was prepared by maceration of the dried plant and this was successively extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain an EtOAc extract and with n-butanol to obtain an n-BuOH extract. Column chromatography of the EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts was followed by purification of different fractions, leading to the isolation of 10 known compounds. Structures of isolated compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral analysis and by comparison to structures of compounds described in the literature. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and gallic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (GAEAC) assays. Antibacterial activity was assessed with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) with respect to strains of a Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus (a major cause of community and hospital-associated infection), and Gram-negative multi-drug-resistant bacteria, Vibrio cholerae (a cause of cholera) and Shigella flexneri (a cause of shigellosis). All of the extracts showed different degrees of antioxidant and antibacterial activities. 2β-hydroxyoleanolic acid, (2R,3S,2''S)-3''',4',4''',5,5'',7,7''-heptahydroxy-3,8""-biflavanone, and luteolin-8-C-glucoside displayed the most potent antibacterial and antioxidant properties, and these properties were in some cases equal to or more potent than those of reference drugs. Overall, the present results show that L. leptocarpa has the potential to be a natural source of anti-diarrheal and antioxidant products, so further investigation is warranted.","['Mabou FD', 'Tamokou JD', 'Ngnokam D', 'Voutquenne-Nazabadioko L', 'Kuiate JR', 'Bag PK']",2016,10,3,Drug Discov Ther,"Mabou FD, et al.

27411101,"Etiologies, Risk Factors and Impact of Severe Diarrhea in the Under-Fives in Moramanga and Antananarivo, Madagascar.","BACKGROUND: Diarrheal disease remains a leading cause of death in children in low-income countries. We investigated the etiology, risk factors and effects on nutritional status of severe diarrhea in children from two districts in Madagascar.
METHODS: We performed a matched case-control study in 2011 to 2014, on children under the age of five years from Moramanga and Antananarivo. The cases were children hospitalized for severe diarrhea and the controls were children without diarrhea selected at random from the community. Stool samples were collected from both groups. Anthropometric measurements were made during follow-up visits about one and two months after enrolment.
RESULTS: We enrolled 199 cases and 199 controls. Rotavirus infection was the most frequently detected cause of diarrhea. It was strongly associated with severe diarrhea (OR: 58.3; 95% CI: 7.7-439.9), accounting for 42.4% (95% CI: 37.6-43.1) of severe diarrhea cases. At the household level, possession of cattle (OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1-0.6) and living in a house with electricity (OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.8) were protective factors. The presence of garbage around the house was a risk factor for severe diarrhea (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.9-5.4). We found no significant association between severe diarrhea and the nutritional status of the children at follow-up visits, but evident wasting at enrolment was associated with a higher risk of severe diarrhea (OR = 9; 95% CI: 4.5-17.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe childhood diarrhea is mostly caused by rotavirus infection. An anti-rotavirus vaccine has already been introduced in Madagascar and should be promoted more widely. However, post-licensing surveillance is required. Interventions to improve the nutritional status of children, preventive measures focused on household and personal hygiene and nutritional rehabilitation during severe diarrheal disease should be reinforced.","['Randremanana RV', 'Razafindratsimandresy R', 'Andriatahina T', 'Randriamanantena A', 'Ravelomanana L', 'Randrianirina F', 'Richard V']",2016,11,7,PLoS One,"Randremanana RV, et al.

27374009,Molecular characterization and analysis of high-level multidrug-resistance of Shigella flexneri serotype 4s strains from China.,"To conduct the first comprehensive analysis of Shigella flexneri serotype 4s, a novel serotype found in 2010, we identified 24 serotype 4s isolates from 1973 shigellosis cases in China (2002-2014). The isolates were characterized by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) phylogenetic analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine their genetic relatedness, and analysed further for their antimicrobial susceptibilities and antimicrobial resistance determinants. The PFGE and SNP phylogenetic analyses suggest that S. flexneri serotype 4s strains are derived from multiple serotypes, including two predominant serotypes in China: serotype X variant and serotype II. Three new sequence types were identified by MLST. All isolates were resistant to ticarcillin, ampicillin and tetracycline, with high-level resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Notably, all the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), with the highest levels of resistance observed for eight antimicrobials classes. Most isolates contain various antimicrobial resistance determinants. In conclusion, we found that serotype 4s isolates have multiple evolutionary sources, diverse biochemical characteristics and genomes, and highly prevalent multidrug resistance and antimicrobial-resistant determinants. With few clinical treatment options, continuous monitoring and timely intervention against this emerging MDR serotype is essential. The possibility that serotype 4s will become the next predominant serotype exists.","['Yang C', 'Li P', 'Zhang X', 'Ma Q', 'Cui X', 'Li H', 'Liu H', 'Wang J', 'Xie J', 'Wu F', 'Sheng C', 'Du X', 'Qi L', 'Su W', 'Jia L', 'Xu X', 'Zhao J', 'Xia S', 'Zhou N', 'Ma H', 'Qiu S', 'Song H']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Yang C, et al.

We compared antimicrobial resistance in Shigella infections related to overseas travel (travel-associated) and in those acquired domestically by analyzing antimicrobial resistance patterns, geographic distributions, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. We tested samples (n = 204) from a collection of isolates recovered from patients in Pennsylvania between 2006 and 2014. Isolates were grouped into travel- and non-travel-associated categories. Eighty-one (79.4%) of the Shigella isolates acquired during international travel were resistant to multiple antibiotics compared to 53 (52.1%) of the infections transmitted in domestic settings. A majority (79.4%) of isolates associated with international travel demonstrated resistance to aminoglycosides and tetracyclines, whereas 47 (46.1%) of the infections acquired domestically were resistant to tetracycline. Almost all isolates (92.2%) transmitted in domestic settings were resistant to aminoglycosides, and 5 isolates from adult male patients were resistant to azithromycin, a drug often used for empiric treatment of severe shigellosis. Twenty (19.6%) isolates associated with illnesses acquired during overseas travel in 4 countries were resistant to quinolones. One S. sonnei PFGE pattern was traced to a multidrug-resistant isolate acquired overseas that had caused a multistate outbreak of shigellosis, suggesting global dissemination of a drug-resistant species. Resistance to certain drugs-for example, tetracycline-increased in both overseas- and domestic-acquired infections during the study period. The prevalence of resistance to macrolides (azithromycin) and third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone) was less than 1%; however, efforts to better monitor changes in drug resistance over time combined with increased antimicrobial stewardship are essential at the local, national, and global levels.","['Li YL', 'Tewari D', 'Yealy CC', 'Fardig D', ""M'ikanatha NM""]",2016,14,3,Health Secur,"Li YL, et al.

The median threshold cycle (CT) values of culture-positive specimens were significantly lower than those of culture-negative ones (CT values, 24.3 versus 28.7; P < 0.001), indicating that the relative bacterial load per fecal specimen was significantly associated with the culture results. In Campylobacter infections, the respective median fecal calprotectin concentrations in PCR-negative/culture-negative (n = 40), PCR-positive/culture-negative (n = 14), and PCR-positive/culture-positive (n = 15) specimens were 134 mg/kg (interquartile range [IQR], 30 to 1,374 mg/kg), 1,913 mg/kg (IQR, 165 to 3,813 mg/kg), and 5,327 mg/kg (IQR, 1,836 to 18,213 mg/kg). Significant differences were observed among the three groups (P < 0.001), and a significant linear trend was identified (P < 0.001).

It's therefore increasingly important to examine these relationships in midlatitude regions, where they may have significant public health implications. This study aimed to examine the association between floods and bacillary dysentery in the city of Dalian, China.
METHODS: A generalized additive mixed model was applied to examine the association between floods and bacillary dysentery. The relative risk (RR) of flood impact on bacillary dysentery was estimated.
RESULTS: A total of 18,976 cases of bacillary dysentery were reported in Dalian during the study period. Two weeks' lagged effect was detected from the impact of floods on bacillary dysentery. The RR of flood impact on bacillary dysentery was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.03-1.33).
CONCLUSIONS: Floods have significantly increased the risk of bacillary dysentery in Dalian. More studies should focus on the association between floods and infectious diseases in different regions.

A high prevalence of integrons and gene cassettes play an important role in the transmission of drug resistance in S. flexneri. Effective measures are urgently needed to control the spread of multi-drug-resistant S. flexneri, and more continuing active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance should be established worldwide, especially in developing countries.","['Xu Y', 'Zhuang L', 'Kang H', 'Ma P', 'Xu T', 'Pan S', 'Gu B']",2016,35,8,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Xu Y, et al.

27195892,"Molecular Characterization of Shigella sonnei: An Increasingly Prevalent Etiologic Agent of Shigellosis in Guizhou Province, Southwest of China.","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is a serious problem in Guizhou and Shigella sonnei is an increasingly prevalent etiologic agent of local shigellosis cases. No data, however, are available about the molecular characterization of the local isolates of S. sonnei. We have conducted this study to molecularly characterize the clinical isolates of S. sonnei in Guizhou Province.
RESULTS: 76 S. sonnei isolates, including four isolates from 1974-1982 and 72 isolates from 2008-2010, were used for analysis in this study. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) based on XbaI digestion divided the 76 isolates into 38 PFGE patterns (PT) and 15 PTs were represented by more than one isolates with PT31 (N = 8) containing the most number of isolates, followed with PT2 (N = 6). Multiple-Locus Variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) Analysis (MLVA) based on seven VNTR loci discriminated them into 19 different MLVA types (MTs), and four MTs were represented by more than one isolate with MT4 (N = 39) containing the most number of isolates, followed with MT12 (N = 18). 15 Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) base on 15 loci differentiated the isolates into six sequence types (STs), among which four STs were novel. The most common STs are ST76 (N = 43) and ST116 (N = 25), accounting for 92.1%. Correlation between genetic relationships and geographical origins or isolation years was observed among the isolates studied. Majority of isolates were clustered in accordance with the origin of isolation years based on the genetic data, which were also from similar geographical origins.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the molecular characteristics including the specific genotypes such as four novel STs, clonal relationship, and genetic changes of local isolates from different years, which enhances our understanding of molecular characteristics of S. sonnei and contributes to the prevention and control of shigellosis in Guizhou Province.","['Li S', 'Wang J', 'Wei X', 'Liu Y', 'You L', 'Luo X', 'Tang G', 'Sun Q', 'Ye C', 'Xu J', 'Wang D']",2016,11,5,PLoS One,"Li S, et al.

27193041,Circulating Gut-Homing (α4β7+) Plasmablast Responses against Shigella Surface Protein Antigens among Hospitalized Patients with Diarrhea.,"Developing countries are burdened with Shigella diarrhea. Understanding mucosal immune responses associated with natural Shigella infection is important to identify potential correlates of protection and, as such, to design effective vaccines. We performed a comparative analysis of circulating mucosal plasmablasts producing specific antibodies against highly conserved invasive plasmid antigens (IpaC, IpaD20, and IpaD120) and two recently identified surface protein antigens, pan-Shigella surface protein antigen 1 (PSSP1) and PSSP2, common to all virulent Shigella strains. We examined blood and stool specimens from 37 diarrheal patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General Hospital, Kolkata, India. The etiological agent of diarrhea was investigated in stool specimens by microbiological methods and real-time PCR. Gut-homing (α4β7 (+)) antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were isolated from patient blood by means of combined magnetic cell sorting and two-color enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay. Overall, 57% (21 of 37) and 65% (24 of 37) of the patients were positive for Shigella infection by microbiological and real-time PCR assays, respectively. The frequency of α4β7 (+) IgG ASC responders against Ipas was higher than that observed against PSSP1 or PSSP2, regardless of the Shigella serotype isolated from these patients. Thus, α4β7 (+) ASC responses to Ipas may be considered an indirect marker of Shigella infection. The apparent weakness of ASC responses to PSSP1 is consistent with the lack of cross-protection induced by natural Shigella infection. The finding that ASC responses to IpaD develop in patients with recent-onset shigellosis indicates that such responses may not be protective or may wane too rapidly and/or be of insufficient magnitude.","['Sinha A', 'Dey A', 'Saletti G', 'Samanta P', 'Chakraborty PS', 'Bhattacharya MK', 'Ghosh S', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Kim JO', 'Yang JS', 'Kim DW', 'Czerkinsky C', 'Nandy RK']",2016,23,7,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Sinha A, et al.

27185765,Lethality of First Contact Dysentery Epidemics on Pacific Islands.,"Infectious diseases depopulated many isolated Pacific islands when they were first exposed to global pathogen circulation from the 18th century. Although the mortality was great, the lack of medical observers makes determination of what happened during these historical epidemics largely speculative. Bacillary dysentery caused by Shigella is the most likely infection causing some of the most lethal island epidemics. The fragmentary historical record is reviewed to gain insight into the possible causes of the extreme lethality that was observed during first-contact epidemics in the Pacific. Immune aspects of the early dysentery epidemics and postmeasles infection resulting in subacute inflammatory enteric disease suggest that epidemiologic isolation was the major lethality risk factor on Pacific islands in the 19th century. Other possible risk factors include human leukocyte antigen homogeneity from a founder effect and pathogen-induced derangement of immune tolerance to gut flora. If this analysis is correct, then Pacific islands are currently at no greater risk of emerging disease epidemics than other developing countries despite their dark history.",['Shanks GD'],2016,95,2,Am J Trop Med Hyg,Shanks GD.

27180973,"Resistant Shigella strains in refugees, August-October 2015, Greece.","Shigellosis is endemic in most developing countries and thus a known risk in refugees and internally displaced persons. In 2015, a massive influx of refugees into Greece, due to the political crisis in the Middle East, led to the development of appropriate conditions for outbreaks of communicable diseases as shigellosis. We present a cluster of 16 shigellosis cases in refugees, detected by the implementation of a syndromic notification system in one transit centre in Athens, between 20 August and 7 October 2015. Both Shigella flexneri (n = 8) and S. sonnei (n = 8) were identified, distributed in various serotypes. All tested isolates (n = 13) were multidrug resistant; seven were CTX-M-type extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers. Our results indicate lack of a potential common source, although pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing results revealed small clusters in isolates of the same serotype indicating possible limited person-to-person transmission without identifying secondary community cases related to the refugees. To prevent the spread of shigellosis, empirical antibiotic treatment as well as environmental hygiene measures were implemented. The detection of multi-drug resistance is important for determining the appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment for the more severe cases, while at the same time real-time typing is useful for epidemiological investigation and control measures.","['Georgakopoulou T', 'Mandilara G', 'Mellou K', 'Tryfinopoulou K', 'Chrisostomou A', 'Lillakou H', 'Hadjichristodoulou C', 'Vatopoulos A']",2016,144,11,Epidemiol Infect,"Georgakopoulou T, et al.

Diabetic patients are susceptible to infection with pathogenic bacteria, particularly those causing invasive enteric infections. In this study, we observed changes in the pathophysiological features of mice with streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia. In our experiments, both hyperglycemic and control mice were infected with pathogenic enteric bacteria-non-typhoidal Salmonella, Shigella flexneri, or Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Morbidity, mortality, and bacterial load were all higher in the diabetic mice than in the control mice, and the phagocytic and bactericidal activities of peritoneal macrophages isolated from hyperglycemic mice were lower than they were in the controls. We hypothesize that hyperglycemia leads to a downregulation of the innate immune response, which in turn increases vulnerability to enteric bacterial infection.","['Koley H', 'Ghosh P', 'Sinha R', 'Mitra S', 'Mukherjee P', 'Howlader DR', 'Chaki C', 'Nag D']",2017,70,1,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Koley H, et al.

In a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind design, inpatient participants received a single oral dose of 1.6 × 10(4) CFU of WRSS1. The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with equal numbers of vaccinees and placebo controls showing mild symptoms. Only 3 of 13 vaccinees (23%) had culture-positive stools, while a total of 9 vaccinees were positive by PCR. Lack of vaccine shedding in volunteers correlated with lack of clinical symptoms and immune responses, just as the duration of fecal shedding correlated directly with stronger immune responses. Two months following immunization, 10 vaccinees and 10 newly recruited naive controls received a challenge dose of 1,670 CFU of virulent S. sonnei strain 53G. This dose had previously demonstrated a 75% attack rate for dysentery in Thai volunteers. However, in this study the attack rate for dysentery in naive controls after challenge was 20%. Based on clinical record summaries, 3 vaccinees and 5 naive controls experienced clinically relevant illness (diarrhea/dysentery/fever/shigellosis), and a 40% vaccine efficacy was calculated. When these data are compared to those for the performance of this vaccine candidate in more naive populations, it is clear that a single oral dose of WRSS1 at 10(4) CFU failed to achieve its full potential in a population in which the organism is endemic. Higher doses and/or repeated immunizations may contribute to improved vaccine shedding and consequent elevation of protective immune responses in a population in which the organism is endemic.

Only a few cases of shigellosis during pregnancy have been reported. However, the neonatal and obstetric complications are potentially severe. The objective of this study was to describe the obstetric and neonatal complications of shigellosis during pregnancy. We carried out a retrospective study of 37 cases of shigellosis diagnosed in pregnant women at the maternity unit of Saint-Laurent du Maroni Hospital in west French Guiana between 2000 and 2014. Shigellosis diagnosis was based on the detection of Shigella in stool cultures from pregnant women (34 patients) or in a neonatal sample collected immediately after delivery (three neonates). In addition to the classic symptoms of shigellosis-an association of diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain-we observed uterine contractions before the completion of 37 weeks of gestation in 61% of patients (N = 17/28). Cervical changes were associated with uterine contractions in 82% of cases (N = 14/17); 25% of the patients at risk of preterm birth went on to give birth prematurely (N = 3/12). Three cases of mother-to-child transmission were observed. Episodes of shigellosis in pregnant women may trigger uterine contractions and changes to the cervix, potentially resulting in miscarriage or preterm birth.","['Parisot M', 'Jolivet A', 'Boukhari R', 'Carles G']",2016,95,1,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Parisot M, et al.

There is currently no licensed vaccine and broad spectrum protection requires coverage of multiple serotypes. The live attenuated vaccines CVD 1213 and CVD 1215 were derived from two prominent S. flexneri serotypes: S. flexneri 3a and S. flexneri 6. To provide broad-spectrum immunity, they could be combined with CVD 1208S, a S. flexneri 2a strain that demonstrated promising results in phase I and II clinical trials. Each strain contains a mutation in the guaBA operon. These vaccine candidates were tested in vitro and in vivo and were found to be auxotrophic for guanine and defective in intracellular replication, but capable of inducing cytokine production from both epithelial cells and macrophages. Both strains were attenuated for virulence in the guinea pig Serény test and induced robust serotype-specific antibody responses following immunization. Each strain induced homologous serotype protection against challenge and a mixed inoculum of the three S. flexneri vaccines conferred protection against all three virulent wild-type strains. These data support the use of CVD 1213, CVD 1215 and CVD 1208S in a multivalent vaccine to confer broad protection against disease caused by Shigella flexneri.","['DeLaine BC', 'Wu T', 'Grassel CL', 'Shimanovich A', 'Pasetti MF', 'Levine MM', 'Barry EM']",2016,74,5,Pathog Dis,"DeLaine BC, et al.

27097024,"Disease Burden of 32 Infectious Diseases in the Netherlands, 2007-2011.","BACKGROUND: Infectious disease burden estimates provided by a composite health measure give a balanced view of the true impact of a disease on a population, allowing the relative impact of diseases that differ in severity and mortality to be monitored over time. This article presents the first national disease burden estimates for a comprehensive set of 32 infectious diseases in the Netherlands.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The average annual disease burden was computed for the period 2007-2011 for selected infectious diseases in the Netherlands using the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) measure. The pathogen- and incidence-based approach was adopted to quantify the burden due to both morbidity and premature mortality associated with all short and long-term consequences of infection. Natural history models, disease progression probabilities, disability weights, and other parameters were adapted from previous research. Annual incidence was obtained from statutory notification and other surveillance systems, which was corrected for under-ascertainment and under-reporting. The highest average annual disease burden was estimated for invasive pneumococcal disease (9444 DALYs/year; 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 8911-9961) and influenza (8670 DALYs/year; 95% UI: 8468-8874), which represents 16% and 15% of the total burden of all 32 diseases, respectively. The remaining 30 diseases ranked by number of DALYs/year from high to low were: HIV infection, legionellosis, toxoplasmosis, chlamydia, campylobacteriosis, pertussis, tuberculosis, hepatitis C infection, Q fever, norovirus infection, salmonellosis, gonorrhoea, invasive meningococcal disease, hepatitis B infection, invasive Haemophilus influenzae infection, shigellosis, listeriosis, giardiasis, hepatitis A infection, infection with STEC O157, measles, cryptosporidiosis, syphilis, rabies, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tetanus, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis. The very low burden for the latter five diseases can be attributed to the National Immunisation Programme. The average disease burden per individual varied from 0.2 (95% UI: 0.1-0.4) DALYs per 100 infections for giardiasis, to 5081 and 3581 (95% UI: 3540-3611) DALYs per 100 infections for rabies and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For guiding and supporting public health policy decisions regarding the prioritisation of interventions and preventive measures, estimates of disease burden and the comparison of burden between diseases can be informative. Although the collection of disease-specific parameters and estimation of incidence is a process subject to continuous improvement, the current study established a baseline for assessing the impact of future public health initiatives.","['van Lier A', 'McDonald SA', 'Bouwknegt M', 'EPI group', 'Kretzschmar ME', 'Havelaar AH', 'Mangen MJ', 'Wallinga J', 'de Melker HE']",2016,11,4,PLoS One,"van Lier A, et al.

27092296,Cytosolic Access of Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens: The Shigella Paradigm.,"Shigella is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, which causes bacillary dysentery in humans. A crucial step of Shigella infection is its invasion of epithelial cells. Using a type III secretion system, Shigella injects several bacterial effectors ultimately leading to bacterial internalization within a vacuole. Then, Shigella escapes rapidly from the vacuole, it replicates within the cytosol and spreads from cell-to-cell. The molecular mechanism of vacuolar rupture used by Shigella has been studied in some detail during the recent years and new paradigms are emerging about the underlying molecular events. For decades, bacterial effector proteins were portrayed as main actors inducing vacuolar rupture. This includes the effector/translocators IpaB and IpaC. More recently, this has been challenged and an implication of the host cell in the process of vacuolar rupture has been put forward. This includes the bacterial subversion of host trafficking regulators, such as the Rab GTPase Rab11. The involvement of the host in determining bacterial vacuolar integrity has also been found for other bacterial pathogens, particularly for Salmonella. Here, we will discuss our current view of host factor and pathogen effector implications during Shigella vacuolar rupture and the steps leading to it.","['Mellouk N', 'Enninga J']",2016,6,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Mellouk N and Enninga J.

27091465,Midori-ishi Cyan/monomeric Kusabira-Orange-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay for characterization of various E3 ligases.,"Many bacterial pathogens hijack the host ubiquitin system for their own benefit by delivering effectors with ubiquitin ligase (E3) into host cells via the type III secretion system. Therefore, screening for small compounds that selectively inhibit bacterial but not mammalian E3 ligases is a promising strategy for identifying molecules that could substitute for antibiotics. To facilitate high-throughput screening for bacterial E3 ligase inhibitors, we developed a MiCy/mKO (Midori-ishi Cyan/monomeric Kusabira-Orange)-based FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) assay and validated it on Shigella IpaH E3 ligase effectors. We showed the feasibility of using the MiCy/mKO-based FRET assay to identify the most appropriate ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and determine the lysine specificity of a given E3, both hallmarks of E3 activity. Furthermore, we showed the usefulness of the FRET assay in characterizing mammalian E3 ligases, such as TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and mouse double minute 2 homologue (MDM2). In addition, we confirmed the feasibility of determining the efficiency of inhibition of E3 ligase activity using inhibitors of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, such as UBE1-41, by measuring the IC50 . Based on these results, we concluded that the MiCy/mKO-based FRET assay is useful for characterizing E3 enzyme activity, as well as for high-throughput E3 inhibitor screening.","['Otsubo R', 'Kim M', 'Lee J', 'Sasakawa C']",2016,21,6,Genes Cells,"Otsubo R, et al.

A total of 385 children (207 with diarrhea, 118 with dysentery, and 60 matched controls) were enrolled. Stool samples were cultured, and the suspected colonies were analyzed using biochemical reactions and serotyping. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using disc diffusion method. ipaH-gene PCR was performed directly on stool samples collected from 180 randomly selected patients (60 from each group).
RESULTS: Shigella was isolated using conventional culture methods in 8.2% (95% CI: 5.1%, 12.8%), 33.1% (95% CI: 25.2%, 42.0%), and 0% in the diarrhea, dysentery and control cases, respectively. High resistance was seen towards co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolones, doxycycline and several beta-lactams drugs. Actual prevalence of shigellosis was determined using ipaH gene PCR to be 18.3% (95% CI: 10.4% - 30.1%) diarrhea cases and 56.7% (95% CI: 44.1, 68.4%) dysentery cases. One (1.7%, 95% CI: 0.01%, 9.7%) control specimen also yielded positive result in PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Correct diagnosis of shigellosis is essential to start antimicrobial therapy in selected cases. The prevalence of Shigella / EIEC infection in children is much higher than previously estimated. Despite its high costs and other limitations, we recommend the use of ipaH-gene PCR as a routine tool in the management of childhood acute gastroenteritis cases.","['Aggarwal P', 'Uppal B', 'Ghosh R', 'Krishna Prakash S', 'Chakravarti A', 'Rajeshwari K']",2016,16,1,J Res Health Sci,"Aggarwal P, et al.

27048818,The interplay between regulated necrosis and bacterial infection.,"Necrosis has long been considered as a passive event resulting from a cell extrinsic stimulus, such as pathogen infection. Recent advances have refined this view and it is now well established that necrosis is tightly regulated at the cell level. Regulated necrosis can occur in the context of host-pathogen interactions, and can either participate in the control of infection or favor it. Here, we review the two main pathways implicated so far in bacteria-associated regulated necrosis: caspase 1-dependent pyroptosis and RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. We present how these pathways are modulated in the context of infection by a series of model bacterial pathogens.","['Blériot C', 'Lecuit M']",2016,73,11-12,Cell Mol Life Sci,Blériot C and Lecuit M.

27014639,Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Shigella flexneri Dissemination.,"The intracellular pathogen Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery in humans. The disease is characterized by bacterial invasion of intestinal cells, dissemination within the colonic epithelium through direct spread from cell to cell, and massive inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Here, we review the mechanisms supporting S. flexneri dissemination. The dissemination process primarily relies on actin assembly at the bacterial pole, which propels the pathogen throughout the cytosol of primary infected cells. Polar actin assembly is supported by polar expression of the bacterial autotransporter family member IcsA, which recruits the N-WASP/ARP2/3 actin assembly machinery. As motile bacteria encounter cell-cell contacts, they form plasma membrane protrusions that project into adjacent cells. In addition to the ARP2/3-dependent actin assembly machinery, protrusion formation relies on formins and myosins. The resolution of protrusions into vacuoles occurs through the collapse of the protrusion neck, leading to the formation of an intermediate membrane-bound compartment termed vacuole-like protrusions (VLPs). VLP formation requires tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide signaling in protrusions, which relies on the integrity of the bacterial type 3 secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS is also required for escaping double membrane vacuoles through the activity of the T3SS translocases IpaB and IpaC, and the effector proteins VirA and IcsB. Numerous factors supporting envelope biogenesis contribute to IcsA exposure and maintenance at the bacterial pole, including LPS synthesis, membrane proteases, and periplasmic chaperones. Although less characterized, the assembly and function of the T3SS in the context of bacterial dissemination also relies on factors supporting envelope biogenesis. Finally, the dissemination process requires the adaptation of the pathogen to various cellular compartments through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.",['Agaisse H'],2016,6,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Agaisse H.

Stx production by other shigellae is uncommon, but in 2014, Stx1-producing S. sonnei infections were detected in California. Surveillance was enhanced to test S. sonnei isolates for the presence and expression of stx genes, perform DNA subtyping, describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case-patients, and investigate for sources of infection. During June 2014-April 2015, we identified 56 cases of Stx1-producing S. sonnei, in 2 clusters. All isolates encoded stx1 and produced active Stx1. Multiple pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were identified. Bloody diarrhea was reported by 71% of case-patients; none had hemolytic uremic syndrome. Some initial cases were epidemiologically linked to travel to Mexico, but subsequent infections were transmitted domestically.

26979135,Status of vaccine research and development for Shigella.,"Shigella are gram-negative bacteria that cause severe diarrhea and dysentery. In 2013, Shigella infections caused an estimated 34,400 deaths in children less than five years old and, in 2010, an estimated 40,000 deaths in persons older than five years globally. New disease burden estimates from newly deployed molecular diagnostic assays with increased sensitivity suggest that Shigella-associated morbidity may be much greater than previous disease estimates from culture-based methods. Primary prevention of this disease should be based on universal provision of potable water and sanitation methods and improved personal and food hygiene. However, an efficacious and low-cost vaccine would complement and accelerate disease reduction while waiting for universal access to water, sanitation, and hygiene improvements. This review article provides a landscape of Shigella vaccine development efforts. No vaccine is yet available, but human and animal challenge-rechallenge trials with virulent Shigella as well as observational studies in Shigella-endemic areas have shown that the incidence of disease decreases following Shigella infection, pointing to biological feasibility of a vaccine. Immunity to Shigella appears to be strain-specific, so a vaccine that covers the most commonly detected strains (i.e., S. flexneri 2a, 3a, 6, and S. sonnei) or a vaccine using cross-species conserved antigens would likely be most effective. Vaccine development and testing may be accelerated by use of animal models, such as the guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis or murine pneumonia models. Because there is no correlate of protection, however, human studies will be necessary to evaluate vaccine efficacy prior to deployment. A diversity of Shigella vaccine constructs are under development, including live attenuated, formalin-killed whole-cell, glycoconjugate, subunit, and novel antigen vaccines (e.g., Type III secretion system and outer membrane proteins).","['Mani S', 'Wierzba T', 'Walker RI']",2016,34,26,Vaccine,"Mani S, et al.

The Rotterdam Study is a population-based cohort study among 14,926 subjects aged 45 years and older with up to 24 years of follow-up. Analyses were performed with a generalized estimating equations method in participants who handed-in a diagnostic stool sample. Furthermore, a nested case-control analysis was performed using the total cohort as a reference group. A bacterial microorganism was isolated in 125 samples, whereas 1174 samples were culture negative. In the generalized estimating equations analysis, we found that participants with a bacterial gastroenteritis were more likely than controls to be current users of PPIs (adjusted OR 1.94; 95 % CI 1.15-3.25). Different sensitivity analyses did not change this result. A considerably higher effect was observed (adjusted OR 6.14; 95 % CI 3.81-9.91), using the total cohort as a reference in a nested case-control analysis. Current PPI therapy is associated with an increased risk of bacterial gastroenteritis.

METHODOLOGY: The records of 29,210 patients with infectious diarrhea in the outpatient department of the Jinshan Hospital (Shanghai, China) between January 1998 and December 2013 were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 2,849 samples were positive for intestinal pathogenic bacteria including Vibrio parahaemolyticus (2,489; 84.0%), Salmonella spp. (235; 8.3%), and Shigella spp. (125; 4.4%). V. parahaemolyticus infections are mainly characterized by abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, whereas Shigella spp. infections can, in addition, induce fever. In contrast, Salmonella infections can produce all of these symptoms but in a smaller percentage of patients. During the 16-year study, both the number of patients and the positive infection rate declined. Notably, the rate of infections by V. parahaemolyticus decreased while the detection rates of Salmonella spp. increased year by year from 2006 on with the introduction of a new detection method.
CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella has been identified as the third-most frequent cause of diarrhea from 1998-2006, as the second-most frequent cause from 2006-2010, and as the most frequent cause from 2011-2013, which was mainly due to a sharp decrease of V. parahaemolyticus infections in 2011-2013. Salmonella strains collected in 2011-2013 showed high susceptibility to imipenem (100%) and meropenem (100%), whereas susceptibilities for ampicillin (39%) and piperacillin (40%) were low.","['Qi XL', 'Wang HX', 'Bu SR', 'Xu XG', 'Wu XY', 'Lin DF']",2016,10,2,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Qi XL, et al.

26904514,How Shigella Utilizes Ca(2+) Jagged Edge Signals during Invasion of Epithelial Cells.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery invades intestinal epithelial cells using a type III secretion system (T3SS). Through the injection of type III effectors, Shigella manipulates the actin cytoskeleton to induce its internalization in epithelial cells. At early invasion stages, Shigella induces atypical Ca(2+) responses confined at entry sites allowing local cytoskeletal remodeling for bacteria engulfment. Global Ca(2+) increase in the cell triggers the opening of connexin hemichannels at the plasma membrane that releases ATP in the extracellular milieu, favoring Shigella invasion and spreading through purinergic receptor signaling. During intracellular replication, Shigella regulates inflammatory and death pathways to disseminate within the epithelium. At later stages of infection, Shigella downregulates hemichannel opening and the release of extracellular ATP to dampen inflammatory signals. To avoid premature cell death, Shigella activates cell survival by upregulating the PI3K/Akt pathway and downregulating the levels of p53. Furthermore, Shigella interferes with pro-apoptotic caspases, and orients infected cells toward a slow necrotic cell death linked to mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload. In this review, we will focus on the role of Ca(2+) responses and their regulation by Shigella during the different stages of bacterial infection.","['Bonnet M', 'Tran Van Nhieu G']",2016,6,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Bonnet M and Tran Van Nhieu G.

This nanomachine is used to deliver effector proteins into host cells to promote pathogen entry. A key component of the matured T3SS needle tip complex is the translocator protein IpaB. IpaB can exist in multiple states when prepared as a recombinant protein, however, it has also been described as having additional roles in Shigella pathogenesis. This mini-review will briefly describe some of the features of IpaB as a T3SS needle tip protein, as a pore-forming translocator protein and as an effector protein.

26870829,"Research Investments in Global Health: A Systematic Analysis of UK Infectious Disease Research Funding and Global Health Metrics, 1997-2013.","BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases account for a significant global burden of disease and substantial investment in research and development. This paper presents a systematic assessment of research investments awarded to UK institutions and global health metrics assessing disease burden.
METHODS: We systematically sourced research funding data awarded from public and philanthropic organisations between 1997 and 2013. We screened awards for relevance to infection and categorised data by type of science, disease area and specific pathogen. Investments were compared with mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLD) across three time points.
FINDINGS: Between 1997-2013, there were 7398 awards with a total investment of £3.7 billion. An increase in research funding across 2011-2013 was observed for most disease areas, with notable exceptions being sexually transmitted infections and sepsis research where funding decreased. Most funding remains for pre-clinical research (£2.2 billion, 59.4%). Relative to global mortality, DALYs and YLDs, acute hepatitis C, leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis received comparatively high levels of funding. Pneumonia, shigellosis, pertussis, cholera and syphilis were poorly funded across all health metrics. Tuberculosis (TB) consistently attracts relatively less funding than HIV and malaria.
INTERPRETATION: Most infections have received increases in research investment, alongside decreases in global burden of disease in 2013. The UK demonstrates research strengths in some neglected tropical diseases such as African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, but syphilis, cholera, shigellosis and pneumonia remain poorly funded relative to their global burden. Acute hepatitis C appears well funded but the figures do not adequately take into account projected future chronic burdens for this condition. These findings can help to inform global policymakers on resource allocation for research investment.","['Head MG', 'Fitchett JR', 'Nageshwaran V', 'Kumari N', 'Hayward A', 'Atun R']",2016,3,,EBioMedicine,"Head MG, et al.

We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a formalin-inactivated whole-cell Shigella flexneri2a vaccine, Sf2aWC, given orally to adult volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 82 subjects were randomized to receive three doses of vaccine in dose escalation (2.6 ± 0.8 × 10(8), × 10(9), × 10(10), and × 10(11)vaccine particles/ml). Vaccine safety was actively monitored, and antigen-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses were determined in serum, antibody in lymphocyte supernatant (ALS), and fecal samples. Cytokines were measured in the serum. Sf2aWC was well tolerated and generally safe at all four dose levels. The vaccine resulted in a dose-dependent immune response. At the highest dose, the vaccine induced robust responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in both serum and ALS samples. The highest magnitude and frequency of responses occurred after the first dose in almost all samples but was delayed for IgG in serum. Fifty percent of the vaccinees had a >4-fold increase in anti-LPS fecal antibody titers. Responses to invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa) were low.

26858941,Riboregulators: Fine-Tuning Virulence in Shigella.,"Within the past several years, RNA-mediated regulation (ribo-regulation) has become increasingly recognized for its importance in controlling critical bacterial processes. Regulatory RNA molecules, or riboregulators, are perpetually responsive to changes within the micro-environment of a bacterium. Notably, several characterized riboregulators control virulence in pathogenic bacteria, as is the case for each riboregulator characterized to date in Shigella. The timing of virulence gene expression and the ability of the pathogen to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions is critical to the establishment and progression of infection by Shigella species; ribo-regulators mediate each of these important processes. This mini review will present the current state of knowledge regarding RNA-mediated regulation in Shigella by detailing the characterization and function of each identified riboregulator in these pathogens.","['Fris ME', 'Murphy ER']",2016,6,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Fris ME and Murphy ER.

Although outbreaks of enteric infections have been reported among men who have sex with men (MSM) in British Columbia (BC), the epidemiology of sexually transmitted enteric infections has never been assessed.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of enteric infections in BC to determine if sexual transmission may be occurring.
METHODS: A descriptive analysis was conducted of all reported cases of shigellosis, amebiasis and giardiasis in BC for the period 2003-2012.
RESULTS: For shigellosis and amebiasis, there was a high male-to-female ratio and a higher rate of infection in males aged 20-59 years as compared to all other age-sex groups. Additionally, for shigellosis, adult males were significantly more likely than females to acquire disease locally (RR 1.9; CI 1.7--.4).
CONCLUSION: Analysis suggests that sexual transmission of enteric infections, particularly shigellosis and amebiasis, may be occurring in MSM in BC. Further studies are indicated.","['Narayan S', 'Galanis E', 'BC STEI Group']",2016,42,2,Can Commun Dis Rep,"Narayan S, et al. Are enteric infections sexually transmitted in British Columbia?.

The toxin is a bona fide Mg(2+) -dependent ribonuclease and has been shown to target initiator tRNA(fMet) in vivo. Here, we present crystal structures of active site catalytic triad mutants D7A, D7N, and D98N of the VapC toxin in absence of antitoxin. In all structures, as well as in solution, VapC forms a dimer. In the D98N structure, a Hepes molecule occupies both active sites of the dimer and comparison with the structure of RNase H bound to a DNA/RNA hybrid suggests that the Hepes molecule mimics the position of an RNA nucleotide in the VapC active site.

Few studies have analyzed bacillary dysentery across China and knowledge gaps still exist in the aspects of geographic distribution and ecological drivers, seasonality and its association with meteorological factors, urban-rural disparity, prevalence and distribution of Shigella species. Here, we performed nationwide analyses to fill the above gaps. Geographically, we found that incidence increased along an east-west gradient which was inversely related to the economic conditions of China. Two large endemically high-risk regions in western China and their ecological drivers were identified for the first time. We characterized seasonality of bacillary dysentery incidence and assessed its association with meteorological factors, and saw that it exhibits north-south differences in peak duration, relative amplitude and key meteorological factors. Urban and rural incidences among China's cities were compared, and disparity associated with urbanization level was invariant in most cities. Balanced decrease of urban and rural incidence was observed for all provinces except Hunan. S. flexneri and S. sonnei were identified as major causative species. Increasing prevalence of S. sonnei and geographic distribution of Shigella species were associated with economic status. Findings and inferences from this study draw broader pictures of bacillary dysentery in mainland China and could provide useful information for better interventions and public health planning.","['Zhang H', 'Si Y', 'Wang X', 'Gong P']",2016,13,2,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Zhang H, et al.

26806576,The pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of three canthinone alkaloids after administration of Kumu injection to rats.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Kumu injection (KMI) is made from the branches and stems of Picrasma quassiodes (D. Don) Benn. and has been used clinically for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, acute tonsillitis, enteritis and bacillary dysentery. 3-methylcanthin-2,6-dione, 5-hydroxy-4-methoxycanthin-6-one, 4,5-dimethoxycanthin-6-one are the active ingredients of KMI because of its therapeutic effects.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To develop a LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of three active canthinone alkaloids (4,5-dimethoxycanthin-6-one, 5-hydroxy-4-methoxycanthin-6-one and 3-methylcanthin-2,6-dione) in rat plasma and for the pharmacokinetic study of them after administered of KMI to rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into 5 groups (n=5 per group), 3 groups administered intramuscularly with a single dose of KMI at 0.30, 0.45 and 0.90mL/kg respectively, and the other 2 groups administered intragastically or intravenously a single dose of KMI at 0.9mL/kg respectively. The concentrations of 4,5-dimethoxycanthin-6-one, 5-hydroxy-4-methoxycanthin-6-one and 3-methylcanthin-2,6-dione in plasma were determined by the established LC-MS/MS method at different time points and the pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis.
RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic results indicated that all of the alkaloids were absorbed rapidly and 3-methylcanthin-2,6-dione was eliminated fastest in rats. After intramuscular administration of KMI to rats, the absolute bioavailability is excellent, and the pharmacokinetic profiles are characterized by the first order kinetics.
CONCLUSION: The established method is suitable for the quantitation of the three alkaloids in rat plasma.

During 3 March to 6 May 2015, the Notifiable Disease Surveillance System detected nine non-imported Shigella sonnei infections among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected Taiwanese MSM. We conducted a molecular epidemiological investigation using a 1 : 5 matched case-control study and laboratory characterizations for the isolates. Of the nine patients, four reported engagement in oral-anal sex before illness onset. Shigellosis was associated with a syphilis report within 12 months (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 8.6; 95% CI 1.05-70.3) and no HIV outpatient follow-up within 12 months (aOR 22.3; 95% CI 2.5-201). Shigella sonnei isolates from the nine patients were all ciprofloxacin-resistant and the resistance was associated with S83L and D87G mutations in gyrA and S80I mutation in parC. The nine outbreak isolates were discriminated into two closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) genotypes and seven 8-locus multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA8) types that suggest multiple sources of infections for the outbreak and possible under-recognition of infection among Taiwanese MSM. The outbreak isolates were characterized to be variants of the intercontinentally transmitted SS18.1 clone, which falls into the globally prevalent phylogenetic sub-lineage IIIb. Inter-database pattern similarity searching indicated that the two PFGE genotypes had emerged in the USA and Japan. The epidemiological characteristics of this outbreak suggest roles of risky sexual behaviours or networks in S. sonnei transmission.

26780145,"Quantitative analysis of burden of bacillary dysentery associated with floods in Hunan, China.","BACKGROUND: Jishou and Huaihua, two cities in the west of Hunan Province, had suffered from severe floods because of long-lasting and heavy rainfall during the end of June and July 2012. However, the Disability Adjusted of Life Years (DALYs) of bacillary dysentery caused by the floods have not been examined before. The study aimed to quantify the impact of the floods on the burden of bacillary dysentery in Hunan, China.
METHODS: A unidirectional case-crossover study was firstly conducted to determine the relationship between daily cases of bacillary dysentery and the floods in Jishou and Huaihua of Hunan Province in 2012. Odds ratios (ORs) estimated by conditional logistic regression were used to quantify the risk of the floods on the disease. The years lived with disability (YLDs) of bacillary dysentery attributable to floods were then estimated based on the WHO framework to calculate potential impact fraction in the Burden of Disease study.
RESULTS: Multivariable analysis showed that floods were significantly associated with an increased risk of the number of cases of bacillary dysentery (OR=3.270, 95% CI: 1.299-8.228 in Jishou; OR=2.212, 95% CI: 1.052-4.650 in Huaihua). The strongest effect was shown with a 1-day lag in Jishou and a 4-day lag in Huaihua. Attributable YLD per 1000 of bacillary dysentery due to the floods was 0.0296 in Jishou and 0.0157 in Huaihua.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that floods have significantly increased the risks of bacillary dysentery in the study areas. In addition, a sudden and severe flooding with a shorter duration may cause more burdens of bacillary dysentery than a persistent and moderate flooding. Public health preparation and intervention programs should be taken to reduce and prevent a potential risk of bacillary dysentery epidemics after floods.","['Liu X', 'Liu Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Jiang B']",2016,547,,Sci Total Environ,"Liu X, et al.

26779450,Shigella IpaH Family Effectors as a Versatile Model for Studying Pathogenic Bacteria.,"Shigella spp. are highly adapted human pathogens that cause bacillary dysentery (shigellosis). Via the type III secretion system (T3SS), Shigella deliver a subset of virulence proteins (effectors) that are responsible for pathogenesis, with functions including pyroptosis, invasion of the epithelial cells, intracellular survival, and evasion of host immune responses. Intriguingly, T3SS effector activity and strategies are not unique to Shigella, but are shared by many other bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella, Yersinia, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Therefore, studying Shigella T3SS effectors will not only improve our understanding of bacterial infection systems, but also provide a molecular basis for developing live bacterial vaccines and antibacterial drugs. One of Shigella T3SS effectors, IpaH family proteins, which have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and are widely conserved among other bacterial pathogens, are very relevant because they promote bacterial survival by triggering cell death and modulating the host immune responses. Here, we describe selected examples of Shigella pathogenesis, with particular emphasis on the roles of IpaH family effectors, which shed new light on bacterial survival strategies and provide clues about how to overcome bacterial infections.","['Ashida H', 'Sasakawa C']",2015,5,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Ashida H and Sasakawa C.

Here, we show that Shigella subverts the subcellular trafficking of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a key molecule in immune cell recruitment, in a mechanism dependent on the injected bacterial enzyme IpgD and its product, the lipid mediator PI5P. Overexpression of IpgD, but not a phosphatase dead mutant, induced the internalization and the degradation of ICAM-1 in intestinal epithelial cells. Remarkably, addition of permeant PI5P reproduced IpgD effects and led to the inhibition of neutrophil recruitment. Finally, these results were confirmed in an in vivo model of Shigella infection where IpgD-dependent ICAM-1 internalization reduced neutrophil adhesion. In conclusion, we describe here an immune evasion mechanism used by the pathogen Shigella to divert the host cell trafficking machinery in order to reduce immune cell recruitment.","['Boal F', 'Puhar A', 'Xuereb JM', 'Kunduzova O', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Payrastre B', 'Tronchère H']",2016,14,4,Cell Rep,"Boal F, et al.

METHODS: Burden of disease study based on document analysis of published population surveys, laboratory files, and surveillance data from the Health Management Information System (SIGSA) in four departments of Guatemala: Huehuetenango, Jutiapa, Quetzaltenango, and Santa Rosa, in 2010. Information was supplemented by a laboratory survey. Burden of disease was estimated using methodology adapted by the World Health Organization from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
RESULTS: Surveillance data yielded 72 salmonellosis and 172 shigellosis cases. According to population surveys, the percentage of the population that consults health services for diarrhea is 64.7% (95% CI: 60.6%-68.7%) in Quetzaltenango and 61.0% (95% CI: 56.0%-66.0%) in Santa Rosa. In the 115 laboratories that answered the survey (72.8% response rate), 6 051 suspected samples were collected for stool culture and 3 290 for hemoculture; 39.4% and 100.0% of them were processed, respectively.

Genetic modification of bacteria to induce hyperblebbing greatly increases the yield of blebs, called Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA). The composition of the GMMA from hyperblebbing mutants of Shigella flexneri 2a and Shigella sonnei were quantitatively analyzed using high-sensitivity mass spectrometry with the label-free iBAQ procedure and compared to the composition of the solubilized cells of the GMMA-producing strains. There were 2306 proteins identified, 659 in GMMA and 2239 in bacteria, of which 290 (GMMA) and 1696 (bacteria) were common to both S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei. Predicted outer membrane and periplasmic proteins constituted 95.7% and 98.7% of the protein mass of S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei GMMA, respectively. Among the remaining proteins, small quantities of ribosomal proteins collectively accounted for more than half of the predicted cytoplasmic protein impurities in the GMMA. In GMMA, the outer membrane and periplasmic proteins were enriched 13.3-fold (S. flexneri 2a) and 8.3-fold (S. sonnei) compared to their abundance in the parent bacteria. Both periplasmic and outer membrane proteins were enriched similarly, suggesting that GMMA have a similar surface to volume ratio as the surface to periplasmic volume ratio in these mutant bacteria. Results in S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei showed high reproducibility indicating a robust GMMA-producing process and the low contamination by cytoplasmic proteins support the use of GMMA for vaccines.

This retrospective study aimed to provide insights into the antibiotic resistance and genetic diversity of a set of Shigella sonnei isolates recovered during that period. A total of 59 S. sonnei isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ampicillin, cefotaxim, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, sulphonamides compound, trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin), biotyping, and molecular characterization of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and integron content. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed in order to assess the genetic relatedness of the isolates. Thirty-eight (64%) of the studied isolates displayed multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes, the most common resistance profile comprising resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulphonamides compound, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to cefotaxim was detected in a biotype g blaCTX-M-15 and a biotype e blaCMY-2-positive isolate, respectively. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and/or nalidixic acid was detected in three MDR isolates and was due to known mutations in gyrA gene leading to aminoacid substitutions (i.e. Ser83Leu, Asp87Tyr, Asp87Gly). Either class 1 or class 2 integrons were identified in 10 isolates. Comparisons of XbaI PFGE patterns of S. sonnei isolates revealed 9 clonal groups and 6 unique patterns.

In this review, we focus on the OMVs produced by gram-negative bacteria. We provide an overview of the OMV structure, various factors regulating their production, and their role in modulating host immune response using a few representative examples. In light of the importance of the diverse cargoes carried by OMVs, we discuss the different modes of their entry into the host cell and advances in the high-throughput detection of these OMVs. A conspicuous application of OMVs lies in the field of vaccination; we discuss its success in immunization against human diseases such as pertussis, meningitis, shigellosis and aqua-farming endangering diseases like edwardsiellosis.","['Anand D', 'Chaudhuri A']",2016,33,6-8,Mol Membr Biol,Anand D and Chaudhuri A.

26706344,Alteration in apyrase enzyme attenuated virulence of Shigella flexneri.,"Virulence of Shigella is attributed to the genes presence in chromosome or in the megaplasmid. The apy gene which is located in the megaplasmid of Shigella species encodes for apyrase enzyme, a pathogenesis-associated enzyme causing mitochondrial damage and host cell death. In this study we constructed an apy mutant of Shigella flexneri by insertional activation using a kanamycin resistant gene cassette. The wild type apy gene of S. flexneri 2a was PCR amplified, cloned and mutated with insertion of kanamycin resistant gene cassette (aphA). The mutated construct (apy: aphA) was subcloned into a conjugative suicidal vector (pWM91) at the unique Sma1 and Sac1 sites. The mutation of the wild apy gene in the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated construct was introduced into wild type S. flexneri 2a by conjugation with Escherichia coli. After undergoing homologous recombination, the wild apy gene was deleted from the construct using the sucrose selection method. Non-functional activity of the apyrase enzyme in the constructed strain by colorimetric test indicated the successful mutation of the apyrase enzyme. This strain with mutated apy gene was evaluated for its protective efficacy using the guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis model. The strain was Sereny negative and it elicited a significant protection following challenge with wild S. flexneri strain. This apy mutant strain will form a base for the development of a vaccine target for shigellosis.","['BangaSingh KK', 'Nisha M', 'Lau HY', 'Ravichandran M', 'Salleh MZ']",2016,91,,Microb Pathog,"BangaSingh KK, et al.

26700764,Bacterial E3 Ubiquitin Ligase IpaH4.5 of Shigella flexneri Targets TBK1 To Dampen the Host Antibacterial Response.,"IFN regulatory factors play a pivotal role in many cellular processes, including inflammatory and immune responses. Their activation is tightly regulated by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). In response to microbial components, TBK1 activates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and cytokine expression. In this article, we show that TBK1 is a novel target of the IpaH4.5 protein, a Shigella type III effector possessing E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Remarkably, IpaH4.5 interacts with TBK1 and promotes its K48-linked polyubiquitylation. Consequently, polyubiquitylated TBK1 undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation, which perturbs the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation of IRF3. Because IRF3 and TBK1 are required for restricting Shigella growth, we propose that the polyubiquitylation and degradation of TBK1 during Shigella infection are new bacterial strategies to modulate the host antibacterial responses.","['Zheng Z', 'Wei C', 'Guan K', 'Yuan Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma S', 'Cao Y', 'Wang F', 'Zhong H', 'He X']",2016,196,3,J Immunol,"Zheng Z, et al.

26679624,"Travel Destinations and Sexual Behavior as Indicators of Antibiotic Resistant Shigella Strains--Victoria, Australia.","BACKGROUND: Knowledge of relationships between antibiotic susceptibility of Shigella isolates and travel destination or other risk factors can assist clinicians in determining appropriate antibiotic therapy prior to susceptibility testing. We describe relationships between resistance patterns and risk factors for acquisition in Shigella isolates using routinely collected data for notified cases of shigellosis between 2008 and 2012 in Victoria, Australia.
METHODS: We included all shigellosis patients notified during the study period, where Shigella isolates were tested for antimicrobial sensitivity using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. Cases were interviewed to collect data on risk factors, including recent travel. Data were analyzed using Stata 13.1 to examine associations between risk factors and resistant strains.
RESULTS: Of the 500 cases of shigellosis, 249 were associated with overseas travel and 210 were locally acquired. Forty-six of 51 isolates of Indian origin displayed decreased susceptibility or resistance to ciprofloxacin. All isolates of Indonesian origin were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Twenty-six travel-related isolates were resistant to all tested oral antimicrobials. Male-to-male sexual contact was the primary risk factor for 80% (120/150) of locally acquired infections among adult males, characterized by distinct periodic Shigella sonnei outbreaks.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider travel destination as a marker for resistance to common antimicrobials in returning travelers, where severe disease requires empirical treatment prior to receipt of individual sensitivity testing results. Repeated outbreaks of locally acquired shigellosis among men who have sex with men highlight the importance of prevention and control measures in this high-risk group.","['Lane CR', 'Sutton B', 'Valcanis M', 'Kirk M', 'Walker C', 'Lalor K', 'Stephens N']",2016,62,6,Clin Infect Dis,"Lane CR, et al.

26679253,Clinical implications of reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones in paediatric Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri infections.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify the impact of fluoroquinolone resistance on the clinical outcome of paediatric shigellosis patients treated with fluoroquinolones in southern Vietnam. Such information is important to inform therapeutic management for infections caused by this increasingly drug-resistant pathogen, responsible for high morbidity and mortality in young children globally.
METHODS: Clinical information and bacterial isolates were derived from a randomized controlled trial comparing gatifloxacin with ciprofloxacin for the treatment of paediatric shigellosis. Time-kill experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of MIC on the in vitro growth of Shigella and Cox regression modelling was used to compare clinical outcome between treatments and Shigella species.
RESULTS: Shigella flexneri patients treated with gatifloxacin had significantly worse outcomes than those treated with ciprofloxacin. However, the MICs of fluoroquinolones were not significantly associated with poorer outcome. The presence of S83L and A87T mutations in the gyrA gene significantly increased MICs of fluoroquinolones. Finally, elevated MICs and the presence of the qnrS gene allowed Shigella to replicate efficiently in vitro in high concentrations of ciprofloxacin.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that below the CLSI breakpoint, there was no association between MIC and clinical outcome in paediatric shigellosis infections. However, S. flexneri patients had worse clinical outcomes when treated with gatifloxacin in this study regardless of MIC. Additionally, Shigella harbouring the qnrS gene are able to replicate efficiently in high concentrations of ciprofloxacin and we hypothesize that such strains possess a competitive advantage against fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains due to enhanced shedding and transmission.","['Thompson CN', 'Thieu NT', 'Vinh PV', 'Duc AN', 'Wolbers M', 'Vinh H', 'Campbell JI', 'Ngoc DT', 'Hoang NV', 'Thanh TH', 'The HC', 'Nguyen TN', 'Lan NP', 'Parry CM', 'Chau NV', 'Thwaites G', 'Thanh DP', 'Baker S']",2016,71,3,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Thompson CN, et al.

26674319,Characteristics of bacterial acute diarrhea among women.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics of women presenting with acute gastroenteritis due to infection with Salmonella spp. or Shigella spp.
METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted using data for patients with specimens positive for Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. attending two major women's hospitals in Porto Alegre, Brazil, between January 2003 and July 2014. Women were included if they had symptoms compatible with bacterial acute diarrhea. Isolates were evaluated to determine antimicrobial susceptibility and patient clinical profile.
RESULTS: Among 45 eligible patients, Salmonella spp. was identified in 32 (71%) and Shigella spp. in 13 (29%). The highest antimicrobial sensitivity rates were observed for ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone (n=44, 98% for both) whereas the greatest resistance rate was seen for ampicillin (n=20, 44%). Seven (16%) of the women were pregnant.
CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim are suitable choices for the treatment of bacterial acute diarrhea. However, the maternal and fetal safety profile of prescribed medications should be considered when treating pregnant patients.","['Rocha-Castro J', 'Kronbauer K', 'Dallé J', 'Jimenez MF', 'Riche CW', 'Santiago JA', 'Antonello VS']",2016,132,3,Int J Gynaecol Obstet,"Rocha-Castro J, et al.

26656915,"Outbreaks of Acute Gastroenteritis Transmitted by Person-to-Person Contact, Environmental Contamination, and Unknown Modes of Transmission--United States, 2009-2013.","PROBLEM/CONDITION: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a major cause of illness in the United States, with an estimated 179 million episodes annually. AGE outbreaks propagated through direct person-to-person contact, contaminated environmental surfaces, and unknown modes of transmission were not systematically captured at the national level before 2009 and thus were not well characterized.
REPORTING PERIOD: 2009-2013.
DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) is a voluntary national reporting system that supports reporting of all waterborne and foodborne disease outbreaks and all AGE outbreaks resulting from transmission by contact with contaminated environmental sources, infected persons or animals, or unknown modes. Local, state, and territorial public health agencies within the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia (DC), five U.S. territories, and three Freely Associated States report outbreaks to CDC via NORS using a standard online data entry system.
RESULTS: A total of 10,756 AGE outbreaks occurred during 2009-2013, for which the primary mode of transmission occurred through person-to-person contact, environmental contamination, and unknown modes of transmission. NORS received reports from public health agencies in 50 U.S. states, DC, and Puerto Rico. These outbreaks resulted in 356,532 reported illnesses, 5,394 hospitalizations, and 459 deaths. The median outbreak reporting rate for all sites in a given year increased from 2.7 outbreaks per million population in 2009 to 11.8 outbreaks in 2013. The etiology was unknown in 31% (N = 3,326) of outbreaks. Of the 7,430 outbreaks with a suspected or confirmed etiology reported, norovirus was the most common, reported in 6,223 (84%) of these outbreaks. Other reported suspected or confirmed etiologies included Shigella (n = 332) and Salmonella (n = 320). Outbreaks were more frequent during the winter, with 5,716 (53%) outbreaks occurring during December-February, and 70% of the 7,001 outbreaks with a reported setting of exposure occurred in long-term-care facilities (n = 4,894). In contrast, 59% (n = 143) of shigellosis outbreaks, 36% (n = 30) of salmonellosis outbreaks, and 32% (n = 84) of other or multiple etiology outbreaks were identified in child care facilities.
INTERPRETATION: NORS is the first U.S. surveillance system that provides national data on AGE outbreaks spread through person-to-person contact, environmental contamination, and unknown modes of transmission. The increase in reporting rates during 2009-2013 indicates that reporting to NORS improved notably in the 5 years since its inception. Norovirus is the most commonly reported cause of these outbreaks and, on the basis of epidemiologic data, might account for a substantial proportion of outbreaks without a reported etiology. During 2009-2013, norovirus accounted for most deaths and health care visits in AGE outbreaks spread through person-to-person contact, environmental contamination, and unknown modes of transmission.
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Recommendations for prevention and control of AGE outbreaks transmitted through person-to-person contact, environmental contamination, and unknown modes of transmission depend primarily on appropriate hand hygiene, environmental disinfection, and isolation of ill persons. NORS surveillance data can help identify priority targets for the development of future control strategies, including hygiene interventions and vaccines, and help monitor the frequency and severity of AGE outbreaks in the United States. Ongoing study of these AGE outbreaks can provide a better understanding of certain pathogens and their modes of transmission. For example, certain reported outbreak etiologies (e.g., Salmonella) are considered primarily foodborne pathogens but can be transmitted through multiple routes. Similarly, further examination of outbreaks of unknown etiology could help identify barriers to making an etiologic determination, to analyze clinical and epidemiologic clues suggestive of a probable etiology, and to discover new and emerging etiologic agents. Outbreak reporting to NORS has improved substantially since its inception, and further outreach efforts and system improvements might facilitate additional increases in the number and completeness of reports to NORS.","['Wikswo ME', 'Kambhampati A', 'Shioda K', 'Walsh KA', 'Bowen A', 'Hall AJ', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']",2015,64,12,MMWR Surveill Summ,"Wikswo ME, et al.

26655018,Daily temperature change in relation to the risk of childhood bacillary dysentery among different age groups and sexes in a temperate city in China.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, many studies have found that ambient temperature is significantly associated with bacillary dysentery (BD). However, there is limited evidence on the relationship between temperature and childhood BD in temperate areas.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between daily mean temperature (MT) and childhood BD in China.
METHODS: Data on daily MT and childhood BD between 2006 and 2012 were collected from the Bureau of Meteorology and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Hefei, Anhui Province, China. A Poisson generalized linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to analyse the effects of temperature on childhood BD across different age and sex subgroups.
RESULTS: An increase in temperature was significantly associated with childhood BD, and each 1 °C increase corresponded to an increase of 1.58% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-2.71%] in the number of cases of BD. Children aged 0-5 years and girls were particularly sensitive to the effects of temperature.
CONCLUSIONS: High temperatures may increase the risk of childhood BD in Hefei. Children aged 0-5 years and girls appear to be particularly sensitive to the effects of high temperature.","['Li K', 'Zhao K', 'Shi L', 'Wen L', 'Yang H', 'Cheng J', 'Wang X', 'Su H']",2016,131,,Public Health,"Li K, et al.

26640051,The roles of the virulence factor IpaB in Shigella spp. in the escape from immune cells and invasion of epithelial cells.,"Shigellosis is an acute invasive enteric infection by the Gram negative pathogen Shigella, which causes human diarrhea. Shigella, which are highly epidemic and pathogenic, have become a serious public health problem. The virulence plasmid is a large plasmid essential to the infected host cells. Many virulence factors are encoded in the ipa-mxi-spa region by the virulence plasmid. IpaB is a multifunctional and essential virulence factor in the infection process. In this review article, we introduce the recent studies of the effect of IpaB in Shigella-infected host cells. IpaB is involved in a type III secretion system (T3SS) structure. It also controls the secretion of virulence factors and Shigella adhesion to host cells. In addition, it forms the ion pore, destroys phagosomes, and induces the immune cell's apoptosis or necrosis. Moreover, IpaB can become a potential antigen for Shigella vaccine development.","['Yang SC', 'Hung CF', 'Aljuffali IA', 'Fang JY']",2015,181,,Microbiol Res,"Yang SC, et al.

26631435,"The detection and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Shigella isolates from meat and swab samples at butchers' shops in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia.","Food borne pathogens are major causes of deaths, illnesses and billions of dollars of expenses. The burden of food borne illness is worsened by the ever increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance microbes. Shigella, a bacterial pathogen associated with food, is reported to account for higher prevalence rates of food borne illness in different settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 10 to June 30, 2013, at the butcher houses of Gondar town in the Northwest of Ethiopia to assess the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Shigella. Cattle raw meat and swab samples from selected critical control points, including knives, chopping boards, and the hands and noses of butchers, were collected and analyzed. The identification of Shigella was carried out using colony characteristics, the Gram reaction, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The overall hygienic status of the butcher shops was also assessed using a checklist. An observational analysis revealed that the sanitary condition of the butcher shops and their premises was poor. Of 306 samples screened, 10.5% were positive for Shigella. Approximately 7.4% of meat samples and 10.2% of swab samples were contaminated with Shigella. Out of the total Shigella isolates, 90.6%, 46.9%, 18.8% and 9.4% were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and tetracycline, respectively. A multidrug resistance pattern was recorded in 27.8% of the isolates. In conclusion, the safety of meat sold at Gondar butchers houses was poor. The identified Shigella isolates showed high levels of drug resistance and multidrug resistance patterns for commonly used antimicrobials in veterinary and human medicine. Practicing wise use of antimicrobials and strict sanitary interventions at different critical control points is strongly recommended, in addition to further in-depth studies to prevent unprecedented consequences from shigellosis.","['Garedew L', 'Hagos Z', 'Zegeye B', 'Addis Z']",2016,9,3,J Infect Public Health,"Garedew L, et al.

26612033,Isolation and Comparative Genomic Analysis of T1-Like Shigella Bacteriophage pSf-2.,"The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Shigella sp. emphasizes that alternatives to conventional antibiotics are needed. Siphoviridae bacteriophage (phage), pSf-2, infecting S. flexneri ATCC(®) 12022 was isolated from Geolpocheon stream in Korea. Morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealed that pSf-2 has a head of about 57 ± 4 nm in diameter with a long tail of 136 ± 3 nm in length and 15 ± 2 nm in width. One-step growth analysis revealed that pSf-2 has latent period of 30 min and burst size of 16 PFU/infected cell. The DNA genome of pSf-2 is composed of 50,109 bp with a G+C content of 45.44 %.

The present review is devoted to structural, serological, and genetic aspects of these modifications, including O-acetylation and phosphorylation with phosphoethanolamine that have been identified recently. The modifications confer the host with specific immunodeterminants (O-factors or O-antigen epitopes), which accounts for the antigenic diversity of S. flexneri considered as a virulence factor of the pathogen. Totally, 30 O-antigen variants have been recognized in these bacteria, the corresponding O-factors characterized using specific antibodies, and a significant extension of the serotyping scheme of S. flexneri on this basis is suggested. Multiple genes responsible for the O-antigen modifications and the resultant serotype conversions of S. flexneri have been identified. The genetic mechanisms of the O-antigen diversification by acquisition of mobile genetic elements, including prophages and plasmids, followed occasionally by gene mobilization and inactivation have been revealed. These findings further our understanding of the genetics and antigenicity of S. flexneri and assist control of shigellosis.","['Knirel YA', 'Sun Q', 'Senchenkova SN', 'Perepelov AV', 'Shashkov AS', 'Xu J']",2015,80,7,Biochemistry (Mosc),"Knirel YA, et al.

A questionnaire was used to survey and feces samples were examined for 16 enteropathogens. We enrolled 1422 children and 1047 adults from developed region and 755 children from developing region. Virus positive rates were 32.98% for children and 23.67% for adults in developed region. The most prevalent pathogen for children was rotavirus whereas for adults was norovirus. Bacterial isolation rates were 13.92% for children from developed region, while 29.14% for children from the developing regions. For the greatest difference, Shigella accounted for 50.79% and was the dominant pathogen in the developing region, whereas in the developed region it was only 1.45%. There was no significant relationship between the local levels of development with diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DEC) categories. But it was seen the notable differences between the population with different age: enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC) and enteroaggregative E.coli (EAggEC) were the primary classes of DEC in children from both regions, whereas it was enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) in adults. The symptoms of Shigella and Salmonella infection, such as bloody stools, white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC) positivity and fever were similar in children, which may lead to the misidentification. Yersinia enterocolitica and shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) infections were firstly reported in Beijing. There was a large difference in etiology of bacterial diarrhea between children in developing and developed regions of China.","['Wang X', 'Wang J', 'Sun H', 'Xia S', 'Duan R', 'Liang J', 'Xiao Y', 'Qiu H', 'Shan G', 'Jing H']",2015,10,11,PLoS One,"Wang X, et al.

26518395,HIV-Related Opportunistic Infections Are Still Relevant in 2015.,"The incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections (OIs) has declined in the United States with the increasing use of effective antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV infection. However, the absolute number of patients with OIs remains high and there continues to be considerable associated mortality. OI guidelines from the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America continue to be updated on a regular basis, several times per year, as optimal strategies for prevention and therapy evolve. Recommendations that have changed in these guidelines include: screening for cryptococcal antigen and treatment of asymptomatic antigenemia; empiric treatment of shigellosis infection in light of the recent spread of multidrug-resistant strains; the relative roles of vancomycin and metronidazole in diarrheal illness related to Clostridium difficile; and diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP; formerly Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia).

26508303,"Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Shigella among acute diarrheal outpatients in Mekelle hospital, Northern Ethiopia.","BACKGROUND: Emergence of increased antimicrobial resistance of Shigella species is a global challenge, particularly in developing countries where increased misuse of antimicrobial agents occurs. There is no published data in the study area on the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Shigella among acute diarrheal patients. This study was therefore, under taken to fill this gap.
METHODS: Using cross sectional study method, stool specimens were collected from 216 patients with acute diarrhea at Mekelle Hospital from August to November 2014. Standard bacteriological methods were used to isolate and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolates, and data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.
RESULTS: Out of the total 216 participants, Shigella was isolated from 15 (6.9 %) of the participants. Ten (66.7 %) of the positive isolates were from children <15 years (p = 0.005). Latrine availability, source of drinking water and hand washing habits before meal were statistically significant with shigellosis (p < 0.05). Isolates of Shigella showed 100, 86.7 and 66.7 % resistance to amoxicillin, amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole respectively. Low levels of resistance were observed for norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (6.7 % each). Overall, 80 % of the isolates showed multidrug resistance.
CONCLUSION: Shigella isolates were highly resistant to amoxicillin, amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. However, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were effective. Antibiotic surveillance is needed to prevent further emergence of drug resistant Shigella strains. More has to be done in the availability of latrine, supply of safe drinking water to the community to reduce the disease burden.","['Gebrekidan A', 'Dejene TA', 'Kahsay G', 'Wasihun AG']",2015,8,,BMC Res Notes,"Gebrekidan A, et al.

We infected rhesus macaques orally and also treated them orally with a small and non-absorbable polypropyletherimine dendrimer glucosamine that is a Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) antagonist. Antibiotics were not given for this life-threatening infection. Six days later, the clinical score for diarrhoea, mucus and blood was 54% lower, colon interleukin-8 and interleukin-6 were both 77% lower, and colon neutrophil infiltration was 75% less. Strikingly, vasculitis did not occur and tissue fibrin thrombi were reduced by 67%. There was no clinical toxicity or adverse effect of dendrimer glucosamine on systemic immunity. This is the first report in non-human primates of the therapeutic efficacy of a small and orally bioavailable TLR antagonist in severe infection. Our results show that an oral TLR4 antagonist can enable controlled resolution of the infection-related-inflammatory response and can also prevent neutrophil-mediated gut wall necrosis in severe infectious diarrhoeas.","['Islam D', 'Lombardini E', 'Ruamsap N', 'Imerbsin R', 'Khantapura P', 'Teo I', 'Neesanant P', 'Gonwong S', 'Yongvanitchit K', 'Swierczewski BE', 'Mason CJ', 'Shaunak S']",2016,147,2,Immunology,"Islam D, et al.

Household contacts of patients were 44 times more likely to develop a Shigella infection than were control contacts (odds ratio 44.7, 95% CI 5.5-361.6); 29 (94%) household contacts of shigellosis patients were infected with the same species and serotype as the index patient's. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that 14 (88%) of 16 with infected contacts had strains that were indistinguishable from or closely related to the index patient's strain.

26478541,Immunization of Mice with a Live Transconjugant Shigella Hybrid Strain Induced Th1 and Th17 Cell-Mediated Immune Responses and Confirmed Passive Protection Against Heterologous Shigellae.,"An avirulent, live transconjugant Shigella hybrid (LTSHΔstx) strain was constructed in our earlier study by introducing a plasmid vector, pPR1347, into a Shiga toxin gene deleted Shigella dysenteriae 1. Three successive oral administrations of LTSHΔstx to female adult mice produced comprehensive passive heterologous protection in their offspring against challenge with wild-type shigellae. Production of NO and different cytokines such asIL-12p70, IL-1β and IL-23 in peritoneal mice macrophages indicated that LTSHΔstx induced innate and adaptive immunity in mice. Furthermore, production of IFN-γ, IL-10 and IL-17 in LTSH-primed splenic CD4+ T cell suggested that LTSHΔstx may induce Th1 and Th17 cell-mediated immune responses. Exponential increase of the serum IgG and IgA titre against whole shigellae was observed in immunized adult mice during and after the immunization with the highest peak on day 35. Antigen-specific sIgA was also determined from intestinal lavage of immunized mice. The stomach extracts of neonates from immunized mice, mainly containing mother's milk, contained significant levels of anti-LTSHΔstx immunoglobulin. These studies suggest that the LTSHΔstx could be a new live oral vaccine candidate against shigellosis in the near future.","['Nag D', 'Koley H', 'Sinha R', 'Mukherjee P', 'Sarkar C', 'Withey JH', 'Gachhui R']",2016,83,2,Scand J Immunol,"Nag D, et al.

26473364,Shigella Effector OspB Activates mTORC1 in a Manner That Depends on IQGAP1 and Promotes Cell Proliferation.,"The intracellular bacterial pathogen Shigella infects and spreads through the human intestinal epithelium. Effector proteins delivered by Shigella into cells promote infection by modulating diverse host functions. We demonstrate that the effector protein OspB interacts directly with the scaffolding protein IQGAP1, and that the absence of either OspB or IQGAP1 during infection leads to larger areas of S. flexneri spread through cell monolayers. We show that the effect on the area of bacterial spread is due to OspB triggering increased cell proliferation at the periphery of infected foci, thereby replacing some of the cells that die within infected foci and restricting the area of bacterial spread. We demonstrate that OspB enhancement of cell proliferation results from activation of mTORC1, a master regulator of cell growth, and is blocked by the mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin. OspB activation of mTORC1, and its effects on cell proliferation and bacterial spread, depends on IQGAP1. Our results identify OspB as a regulator of mTORC1 and mTORC1-dependent cell proliferation early during S. flexneri infection and establish a role for IQGAP1 in mTORC1 signaling. They also raise the possibility that IQGAP1 serves as a scaffold for the assembly of an OspB-mTORC1 signaling complex.","['Lu R', 'Herrera BB', 'Eshleman HD', 'Fu Y', 'Bloom A', 'Li Z', 'Sacks DB', 'Goldberg MB']",2015,11,10,PLoS Pathog,"Lu R, et al.

Firstly, we used space-time scan statistic to detect the high risk spatio-temporal clusters in each year. Then, bivariate spatial correlation and Bayesian spatio-temporal model were utilized to examine the associations between the socio-economic factors and BD incidence. Spatio-temporal clusters of BD were mainly located in the northern-southern belt of the midwest area of Sichuan province.

The present study using the p5-C3 assembly method revealed that (1) the plasmid pSF07201 with aac(6')-Ib-cr had 75,335 bp with antibiotic resistance genes CTX-M-3, TEM-1, and FosA3; (2) seven fragments of pSF07201 had more than 99% homology with the seven corresponding plasmids; (3) the other plasmid pSF07202 with qnrS had 47,669 bp with antibiotic resistance gene TEM-1 and 99.95% homology with a segment of pKF362122, which has the qnrS gene from location 162,490 to 163,146. A conjugation and electrotransformation experiment suggested that these two plasmids might horizontally transfer between and coexist in Escherichia coli J53 and S. flexneri 2a 301. Either the aac(6')-Ib-cr or qnrS gene contributed to, but only the coexistence of the two genes conferred to the resistance to ciprofloxacin in these two strains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the complete sequences of the aac(6')-Ib-cr- and qnrS-positive plasmids in Shigella isolates.

26407270,Failure of Syndrome-Based Diarrhea Management Guidelines to Detect Shigella Infections in Kenyan Children.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella is a leading cause of childhood diarrhea mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend antibiotics for children in non cholera-endemic areas only in the presence of dysentery, a proxy for suspected Shigella infection.
METHODS: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the syndromic diagnosis of Shigella-associated diarrhea, we enrolled children aged 6 months to 5 years presenting to 1 of 3 Western Kenya hospitals between November 2011 and July 2014 with acute diarrhea. Stool samples were tested using standard methods for bacterial culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for pathogenic Escherichia coli. Stepwise multivariable logit models identified factors to increase the sensitivity of syndromic diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among 1360 enrolled children, median age was 21 months (interquartile range, 11-37), 3.4% were infected with human immunodeficiency virus, and 16.5% were stunted (height-for-age z-score less than -2). Shigella was identified in 63 children (4.6%), with the most common species being Shigella sonnei (53.8%) and Shigella flexneri (40.4%). Dysentery correctly classified 7 of 63 Shigella cases (sensitivity, 11.1%). Seventy-eight of 1297 children without Shigella had dysentery (specificity, 94.0%). The combination of fecal mucous, age over 23 months, and absence of excessive vomiting identified more children with Shigella-infection (sensitivity, 39.7%) but also indicated antibiotics in more children without microbiologically confirmed Shigella (specificity, 82.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Reliance on dysentery as a proxy for Shigella results in the majority of Shigella-infected children not being identified for antibiotics. Field-ready rapid diagnostics or updated evidence-based algorithms are urgently needed to identify children with diarrhea most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy.","['Pavlinac PB', 'Denno DM', 'John-Stewart GC', 'Onchiri FM', 'Naulikha JM', 'Odundo EA', 'Hulseberg CE', 'Singa BO', 'Manhart LE', 'Walson JL']",2016,5,4,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,"Pavlinac PB, et al.

The aim of this study was to discover possible causes of this outbreak in the villages of Fassa, Rogh and Amk and to measure the risk of exposure among cases and controls.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in September 2012 in Fassa, Rogh and Amk. All households in the three villages were interviewed. Case and control households were compared to determine possible exposure avenues, including place of residence, source of drinking water, hand hygiene levels and practices related to drinking water, food preparation and environmental sanitation.
RESULTS: Residing in Fassa (P <0.0001; odds ratio [OR] = 4.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.22-10.63) and average hand hygiene practices (P = 0.008; OR = 13.97, 95% CI = 1.58-123.36) were associated with an increased risk of contracting shigellosis. No significant differences were found with regards to the other exposure avenues.
CONCLUSION: This was the first study conducted in Oman regarding an outbreak of shigellosis in a community setting. The only variables that significantly impacted the risk of acute gastroenteritis were residing in Fassa and average hand hygiene practices. The source of the outbreak could not be identified. However, septic tank sanitation and water and food consumption practices were not satisfactory in the studied villages. These need to be addressed to prevent similar outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in this region in the future.","['Abaidani I', 'Raju PA', 'Al-Shualli I', ""Al-Sa'di K"", 'Al-Shaqsi N', 'Al-Khatri A']",2015,15,3,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,"Abaidani I, et al.

26353918,"Purification and characterization of a Shigella conjugate vaccine, produced by glycoengineering Escherichia coli.","Shigellosis remains a major cause of diarrheal disease in developing countries and causes substantial morbidity and mortality in children. Glycoconjugate vaccines consisting of bacterial surface polysaccharides conjugated to carrier proteins are the most effective vaccines for controlling invasive bacterial infections. Nevertheless, the development of a multivalent conjugate vaccine to prevent Shigellosis has been hampered by the complex manufacturing process as the surface polysaccharide for each strain requires extraction, hydrolysis, chemical activation and conjugation to a carrier protein. The use of an innovative biosynthetic Escherichia coli glycosylation system substantially simplifies the production of glycoconjugates. Herein, the Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1) O-polysaccharide is expressed and its functional assembly on an E. coli glycosyl carrier lipid is demonstrated by HPLC analysis and mass spectrometry. The polysaccharide is enzymatically conjugated to specific asparagine residues of the carrier protein by co-expression of the PglB oligosaccharyltransferase and the carrier protein exotoxin A (EPA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The extraction and purification of the Shigella glycoconjugate (Sd1-EPA) and its detailed characterization by the use of physicochemical methods including NMR and mass spectrometry is described. The report shows for the first time that bioconjugation provides a newly developed and improved approach to produce an Sd1 glycoconjugate that can be characterized using state-of-the-art techniques. In addition, this generic process together with the analytical methods is ideally suited for the production of additional Shigella serotypes, allowing the development of a multivalent Shigella vaccine.","['Ravenscroft N', 'Haeuptle MA', 'Kowarik M', 'Fernandez FS', 'Carranza P', 'Brunner A', 'Steffen M', 'Wetter M', 'Keller S', 'Ruch C', 'Wacker M']",2016,26,1,Glycobiology,"Ravenscroft N, et al.

26340432,Investigation on the Synthesis of Shigella flexneri Specific Oligosaccharides Using Disaccharides as Potential Transglucosylase Acceptor Substrates.,"Chemo-enzymatic strategies hold great potential for the development of stereo- and regioselective syntheses of structurally defined bioactive oligosaccharides. Herein, we illustrate the potential of the appropriate combination of a planned chemo-enzymatic pathway and an engineered biocatalyst for the multistep synthesis of an important decasaccharide for vaccine development. We report the stepwise investigation, which led to an efficient chemical conversion of allyl α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)-2-deoxy-2-trichloroacetamido-β-d-glucopyranoside, the product of site-specific enzymatic α-d-glucosylation of a lightly protected non-natural disaccharide acceptor, into a pentasaccharide building block suitable for chain elongation at both ends. Successful differentiation between hydroxyl groups features the selective acylation of primary alcohols and acetalation of a cis-vicinal diol, followed by a controlled per-O-benzylation step. Moreover, we describe the successful use of the pentasaccharide intermediate in the [5 + 5] synthesis of an aminoethyl aglycon-equipped decasaccharide, corresponding to a dimer of the basic repeating unit from the O-specific polysaccharide of Shigella flexneri 2a, a major cause of bacillary dysentery. Four analogues of the disaccharide acceptor were synthesized and evaluated to reach a larger repertoire of O-glucosylation patterns encountered among S. flexneri type-specific polysaccharides.

26328045,Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis for genotyping of Shigella sonnei strains isolated from pediatric patients.,"AIM: The aims of this study were to characterize Iranian Shigella sonnei strains isolated from pediatric cases and evaluate the utility of multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) for genotyping of local S. sonnei strains.
BACKGROUND: S.  sonnei has become the dominant species in certain parts of Iran. Although PFGE is still a gold standard for genotyping and source tracking of food-borne pathogens, it is laborious, expensive, time-consuming, and often difficult to interpret. However, MLVA is a PCR-based method, which is rapid, relatively inexpensive and easy to perform.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 47 S. sonnei isolates were obtained from sporadic cases of pediatric shigellosis in Tehran, Iran, during the years 2002-2003 (n=10) and 2008-2010 (n=37). The patients suffered from acute diarrhea and had evidence of more than three episodes of watery, loose, or bloody stools per day. A MLVA scheme based on 7 VNTR loci was established to assess the diversity of 47 S. sonnei isolates.
RESULTS: Based on the results, it was clear that the S. sonnei isolates were heterogeneous. Overall, 47 S. sonnei isolates were discriminated into 21 different genotypes. Analysis of the MLVA profiles using a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm showed the usefulness of the MLVA assay in discriminating S. sonnei isolates collected over different time periods. However, no correlation was found between the MLVA genotypes and age, gender or clinical symptoms of the patients.
CONCLUSION: It is assumed that our S. sonnei isolates are derived from a limited number of clones that undergo minor genetic changes in the course of time. The present study has provided some valuable insights into the genetic relatedness of S. sonnei in Tehran, Iran.","['Ranjbar R', 'Memariani M']",2015,8,3,Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,Ranjbar R and Memariani M.

26324734,Association Between Shigella Infection and Diarrhea Varies Based on Location and Age of Children.,"Molecular identification of the invasion plasmid antigen-H (ipaH) gene has been established as a useful detection mechanism for Shigella spp. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) identified the etiology and burden of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia using a case-control study and traditional culture techniques. Here, we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to identify Shigella spp. in 2,611 stool specimens from GEMS and compared these results to those using culture. Demographic and nutritional characteristics were assessed as possible risk factors. The qPCR identified more cases of shigellosis than culture; however, the distribution of demographic characteristics was similar by both methods. In regression models adjusting for Shigella quantity, age, and site, children who were exclusively breast-fed had significantly lower odds of MSD compared with children who were not breast-fed (odds ratio [OR] = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.28-0.81). The association between Shigella quantity and MSD increased with age, with a peak in children of 24-35 months of age (OR = 8.2, 95% CI = 4.3-15.7) and the relationship between Shigella quantity and disease was greatest in Bangladesh (OR = 13.2, 95% CI = 7.3-23.8). This study found that qPCR identified more cases of Shigella and age, site, and breast-feeding status were significant risk factors for MSD.","['Lindsay B', 'Saha D', 'Sanogo D', 'Das SK', 'Omore R', 'Farag TH', 'Nasrin D', 'Li S', 'Panchalingam S', 'Levine MM', 'Kotloff K', 'Nataro JP', 'Magder L', 'Hungerford L', 'Faruque AS', 'Oundo J', 'Hossain MA', 'Adeyemi M', 'Stine OC']",2015,93,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Lindsay B, et al.

26315462,A small conserved motif supports polarity augmentation of Shigella flexneri IcsA.,"The rod-shaped enteric intracellular pathogen Shigella flexneri and other Shigella species are the causative agents of bacillary dysentery. S. flexneri are able to spread within the epithelial lining of the gut, resulting in lesion formation, cramps and bloody stools. The outer membrane protein IcsA is essential for this spreading process. IcsA is the initiator of an actin-based form of motility whereby it allows the formation of a filamentous actin 'tail' at the bacterial pole. Importantly, IcsA is specifically positioned at the bacterial pole such that this process occurs asymmetrically. The mechanism of IcsA polarity is not completely understood, but it appears to be a multifactorial process involving factors intrinsic to IcsA and other regulating factors. In this study, we further investigated IcsA polarization by its intramolecular N-terminal and central polar-targeting (PT) regions (nPT and cPT regions, respectively). The results obtained support a role in polar localization for the cPT region and contend the role of the nPT region. We identified single IcsA residues that have measurable impacts on IcsA polarity augmentation, resulting in decreased S. flexneri sprading efficiency. Intriguingly, regions and residues involved in PT clustered around a highly conserved motif which may provide a functional scaffold for polarity-augmenting residues. How these results fit with the current model of IcsA polarity determination is discussed.","['Doyle MT', 'Grabowicz M', 'Morona R']",2015,161,11,Microbiology (Reading),"Doyle MT, et al.

26313003,Multifactor Regulation of the MdtJI Polyamine Transporter in Shigella.,"The polyamine profile of Shigella, the etiological agent of bacillary dysentery in humans, differs markedly from that of E. coli, its innocuous commensal ancestor. Pathoadaptive mutations such as the loss of cadaverine and the increase of spermidine favour the full expression of the virulent phenotype of Shigella. Spermidine levels affect the expression of the MdtJI complex, a recently identified efflux pump belonging to the small multi-drug resistance family of transporters. In the present study, we have addressed the regulation of the mdtJI operon in Shigella by asking which factors influence its expression as compared to E. coli. In particular, after identifying the mdtJI promoter by primer extension analysis, in vivo transcription assays and gel-retardation experiments were carried out to get insight on the silencing of mdtJI in E. coli. The results indicate that H-NS, a major nucleoid protein, plays a key role in repressing the mdtJI operon by direct binding to the regulatory region. In the Shigella background mdtJI expression is increased by the high levels of spermidine typically found in this microorganism and by VirF, the plasmid-encoded regulator of the Shigella virulence regulatory cascade. We also show that the expression of mdtJI is stimulated by bile components. Functional analyses reveal that MdtJI is able to promote the excretion of putrescine, the spermidine precursor. This leads us to consider the MdtJI complex as a possible safety valve allowing Shigella to maintain spermidine to a level optimally suited to survival within infected macrophages and, at the same time, prevent toxicity due to spermidine over-accumulation.","['Leuzzi A', 'Di Martino ML', 'Campilongo R', 'Falconi M', 'Barbagallo M', 'Marcocci L', 'Pietrangeli P', 'Casalino M', 'Grossi M', 'Micheli G', 'Colonna B', 'Prosseda G']",2015,10,8,PLoS One,"Leuzzi A, et al.

26277207,Enteropathogens and antibiotics.,"Infectious gastroenteritis remains a public health problem. The most severe cases are of bacterial origin. In Spain, Campylobacter and Salmonella are the most prevalent bacterial genus, while Yersinia and Shigella are much less frequent. Most cases are usually self-limiting and antibiotic therapy is not generally indicated, unless patients have risk factors for severe infection and shigellosis. Ciprofloxacin, third generation cephalosporins, azithromycin, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and doxycycline are the most recommended drugs. The susceptibility pattern of the different bacteria determines the choice of the most appropriate treatment. The aim of this review is to analyse the current situation, developments, and evolution of resistance and multidrug resistance in these 4 enteric pathogens.","['González-Torralba A', 'García-Esteban C', 'Alós JI']",2018,36,1,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin (Engl Ed),"González-Torralba A, et al.

26272388,Intracellular and membrane-damaging activities of methyl gallate isolated from Terminalia chebula against multidrug-resistant Shigella spp.,"Shigella spp. (Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii and Shigella sonnei) cause bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), which is characterized by bloody mucous diarrhoea. Although a variety of antibiotics have been effective for treatment of shigellosis, options are becoming limited due to globally emerging drug resistance. In the present study, in vitro antibacterial activity of methyl gallate (MG) isolated from Terminalia chebula was determined by performing MIC, minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill kinetic studies. Bacterial membrane-damaging activity of MG was determined by membrane perturbation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cellular drug accumulation, cell infection and assessment of intracellular activities of MG and reference antibiotics were performed using HeLa cell cultures. The bactericidal activity of MG against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Shigella spp. in comparison with other commonly used drugs including fluoroquinolone was demonstrated here. TEM findings in the present study revealed that MG caused the total disintegration of inner and outer membranes, and leakage of the cytoplasmic contents of S. dysenteriae. The level of accumulation of MG and tetracycline in HeLa cells incubated for 24  h was relatively higher than that of ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (ratio of intracellular concentration/extracellular concentration of antibiotic for MG and tetracycline>ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid). The viable number of intracellular S. dysenteriae was decreased in a time-dependent manner in the presence of MG (4 × MBC) and reduced to zero within 20  h. The significant intracellular activities of MG suggested that it could potentially be used as an effective antibacterial agent for the treatment of severe infections caused by MDR Shigella spp.","['Acharyya S', 'Sarkar P', 'Saha DR', 'Patra A', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Bag PK']",2015,64,8,J Med Microbiol,"Acharyya S, et al.

26238191,Species-wide whole genome sequencing reveals historical global spread and recent local persistence in Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri is the most common cause of bacterial dysentery in low-income countries. Despite this, S. flexneri remains largely unexplored from a genomic standpoint and is still described using a vocabulary based on serotyping reactions developed over half-a-century ago. Here we combine whole genome sequencing with geographical and temporal data to examine the natural history of the species. Our analysis subdivides S. flexneri into seven phylogenetic groups (PGs); each containing two-or-more serotypes and characterised by distinct virulence gene complement and geographic range. Within the S. flexneri PGs we identify geographically restricted sub-lineages that appear to have persistently colonised regions for many decades to over 100 years. Although we found abundant evidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinant acquisition, our dataset shows no evidence of subsequent intercontinental spread of antimicrobial resistant strains. The pattern of colonisation and AMR gene acquisition suggest that S. flexneri has a distinct life-cycle involving local persistence.","['Connor TR', 'Barker CR', 'Baker KS', 'Weill FX', 'Talukder KA', 'Smith AM', 'Baker S', 'Gouali M', 'Pham Thanh D', 'Jahan Azmi I', 'Dias da Silveira W', 'Semmler T', 'Wieler LH', 'Jenkins C', 'Cravioto A', 'Faruque SM', 'Parkhill J', 'Wook Kim D', 'Keddy KH', 'Thomson NR']",2015,4,,Elife,"Connor TR, et al.

Given the increasing berry consumption in the EU over the last decades, we undertook a review of the existing evidence to assess the potential scale of threat associated with this product. We searched the literature and four restricted-access online platforms for outbreak/contamination events associated with consumption of frozen berries. We performed an evaluation of the sources to identify areas for improvement. The review revealed 32 independent events (i.e. outbreak, food contamination) in the period 1983–2013, of which 26 were reported after 2004. The identified pathogens were NoV, HAV and Shigella sonnei. NoV was the most common and implicated in 27 events with over 15,000 cases reported. A capture–recapture analysis was performed including three overlapping sources for the period 2005–2013. The study estimated that the event-ascertainment was 62%. Consumption of frozen berries is associated with increasing reports of NoV and HAV outbreaks and contamination events, particularly after 2003. A review of the risks associated with this product is required to inform future prevention strategies. Better integration of the available communication platforms and databases should be sought at EU/EEA level to improve monitoring, prevention and control of food-borne-related events.","['Tavoschi L', 'Severi E', 'Niskanen T', 'Boelaert F', 'Rizzi V', 'Liebana E', 'Gomes Dias J', 'Nichols G', 'Takkinen J', 'Coulombier D']",2015,20,29,Euro Surveill,"Tavoschi L, et al.

26211322,[Detection of CRISPR and its relationship to drug resistance in Shigella].,"OBJECTIVE: To detect clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in Shigella, and to analyze its relationship to drug resistance.
METHODS: Four pairs of primers were used for the detection of convincing CRISPR structures CRISPR-S2 and CRISPR-S4, questionable CRISPR structures CRISPR-S1 and CRISPR-S3 in 60 Shigella strains. All primers were designed using sequences in CRISPR database. CRISPR Finder was used to analyze CRISPR and susceptibilities of Shigella strains were tested by agar diffusion method. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between drug resistance and CRISPR-S4.
RESULTS: The positive rate of convincing CRISPR structures was 95%. The four CRISPR loci formed 12 spectral patterns (A-L), all of which contained convincing CRISPR structures except type K. We found one new repeat and 12 new spacers. The multi-drug resistance rate was 53. 33% . We found no significant difference between CRISPR-S4 and drug resistant. However, the repeat sequence of CRISPR-S4 in multi- or TE-resistance strains was mainly R4.1 with AC deletions in the 3' end, and the spacer sequences of CRISPR-S4 in multi-drug resistance strains were mainly Sp5.1, Sp6.1 and Sp7.

26171358,Development of Multiplex PCR for Simultaneous Detection of Three Pathogenic Shigella Species.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella species are among the common causes of bacterial diarrhoeal diseases. Traditional detection methods are time-consuming resulting in delay in treatment and control of Shigella infections thus there is a need to develop molecular methods for rapid and simultaneous detection of Shigella spp. In this study a rapid multiplex PCR were developed for simultaneous detection of three pathogenic Shigella species.
METHODS: For detection of Shigella spp., a pair of primers was used to replicate a chromosomal sequence. Three other sets of primers were also designed to amplify the target genes of three most common species of Shigella in Iran including S. sonnei, S. flexneri and S. boydii. The multiplex PCR assay was optimized for simultaneous detection and differentiation of three pathogenic Shigella species. The assay specificity was investigated by testing different strains of Shigella and other additional strains belonging to non Shigella species, but responsible for foodborne diseases.
RESULTS: The Shigella genus specific PCR yielded the expected DNA band of 159 bp in all tested strains belonging to four Shigella species. The standard and multiplex PCR assays also produced the expected fragments of 248 bp, 503 bp, and 314 bp, for S. boydii, S. sonnei and S. flexneri, respectively. Each species-specific primer pair did not show any cross-reactivity.
CONCLUSION: Both standard and multiplex PCR protocols had a good specificity. They can provide a valuable tool for the rapid and simultaneous detection and differentiation of three most prevalent Shigella species in Iran.","['Ranjbar R', 'Afshar D', 'Mehrabi Tavana A', 'Najafi A', 'Pourali F', 'Safiri Z', 'Sorouri Zanjani R', 'Jonaidi Jafari N']",2014,43,12,Iran J Public Health,"Ranjbar R, et al.

26162850,"Safety and immunogenicity of a candidate bioconjugate vaccine against Shigella dysenteriae type 1 administered to healthy adults: A single blind, partially randomized Phase I study.","BACKGROUND: Shigellae cause severe disease in endemic countries, especially in children. Several efficacy trials have been conducted with candidate vaccines against Shigellae, but the lack of protection, the safety concerns, or manufacturing challenges hindered successful market approval. Conjugated vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective for different pathogens (i.e., Neisseria meningitidis, Shigella pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae). The bio-conjugation technology, exploited here for the Shigella dysenteriae candidate vaccine, offers a novel and potentially simpler way to develop and produce vaccines against one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries.
METHODS: A novel S. dysenteriae bioconjugate vaccine (GVXN SD133) made of the polysaccharide component of the Shigella O1 lipopolysaccharide, conjugated to the exotoxin protein A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (EPA), was evaluated for immunogenicity and safety in healthy adults in a single blind, partially randomized Phase I study. Forty subjects (10 in each dose group; 2 μg or 10 μg with or without aluminium adjuvant) received two injections 60 days apart and were followed-up for 150 days.
RESULTS: Both doses and formulations were well tolerated; the safety and reactogenicity profiles were consistent with that of other conjugated vaccines, adjuvanted or not, independent of the dose and the number of injections. The GVXN SD133 vaccine elicited statistically significant O1 specific humoral responses at all time points in all vaccination groups. Between-group comparisons did not show statistically significant differences in geometric mean titers of immunoglobulin G and A at any post-vaccination time point.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the GVXN SD133 vaccine has a satisfactory safety profile. It elicited a significant humoral response to Shigella O1 polysaccharides at all doses tested.

26117597,hfq regulates acid tolerance and virulence by responding to acid stress in Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri is an important etiological agent of bacillary dysentery in developing countries. The Hfq protein is thought to play a major regulatory role in various cellular processes in this organism. However, the roles of Hfq in stress tolerance and virulence in S. flexneri in response to environmental stress have not been fully studied. In this study, hfq was highly expressed when S. flexneri was exposed to low pH. Growth retardation was observed in the hfq deletion mutant at pH values ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 and the survival rate of the mutant strain was reduced by 60% in acidic conditions (pH 3.0) compared with the wild-type strain. Additionally, competitive invasion assays in HeLa cells and lung invasion assays showed that the virulence of the hfq deletion mutant was significantly decreased. An evaluation of the mechanism revealed that, along with the expression of the Type III secretion system genes, acid resistance genes were also increased with acid stress. Interestingly, a statistically strong linear correlation was observed between the expression of hfq and Type III secretion system genes, as well as between hfq and acid resistance genes, under various pH conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that Hfq regulates genes related to acid resistance for survival under acid stress and controls virulence through the positive regulation of Type III secretion systems. Importantly, we propose that hfq is a key factor in maximal adaptation to host acid stress during infection, regulating acid stress tolerance and virulence in response to acid stress in S. flexneri.","['Yang G', 'Wang L', 'Wang Y', 'Li P', 'Zhu J', 'Qiu S', 'Hao R', 'Wu Z', 'Li W', 'Song H']",2015,166,6,Res Microbiol,"Yang G, et al. hfq regulates acid tolerance and virulence by responding to acid stress in Shigella flexneri. hfq regulates acid tolerance and virulence by responding to acid stress in Shigella flexneri. 2015; 166:476-85. doi: 10.1016/j.resmic.2015.06.007",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26117597/

Most prior studies concentrated on the relationship between tropical cyclones and injuries and mortality. This study aimed to explore the impacts of different grades of tropical cyclones on infectious diarrhea incidence in Guangdong province, from 2005 to 2011.
METHODS: Mann-Whitney U test was firstly used to examine if infectious diarrhea were sensitive to tropical cyclone. Then unidirectional 1:1 case-crossover design was performed to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between daily number of infectious diarrhea and tropical cyclone from 2005 to 2011 in Guangdong, China. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to eliminate multicollinearity. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: There were no significant relationships between tropical cyclone and bacillary dysentery, amebic dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid cases. Infectious diarrhea other than cholera, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid significantly increased after tropical cyclones. The strongest effect were shown on lag 1 day (HRs = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.22, 3.12) and no lagged effect was detected for tropical depression, tropical storm, severe tropical storm and typhoon, with the largest HRs (95%CI) of 2.16 (95%CI = 1.69, 2.76), 2.43 (95%CI = 1.65, 3.58) and 2.21 (95%CI = 1.65, 2.69), respectively. Among children below 5 years old, the impacts of all grades of tropical cyclones were strongest at lag 0 day. And HRs were 2.67 (95%CI = 1.10, 6.48), 2.49 (95%CI = 1.80, 3.44), 4.89 (95%CI = 2.37, 7.37) and 3.18 (95%CI = 2.10, 4.81), respectively.
CONCLUSION: All grades of tropical cyclones could increase risk of other infectious diarrhea. Severe tropical storm has the strongest influence on other infectious diarrhea. The impacts of tropical cyclones on children under 5 years old were higher than total population.","['Kang R', 'Xun H', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang W', 'Wang X', 'Jiang B', 'Ma W']",2015,10,6,PLoS One,"Kang R, et al.

26102119,[Relevant public health enteropathogens].,"Diarrhea remains the third leading cause of death in children under five years, despite recent advances in the management and prevention of this disease. It is caused by multiple pathogens, however, the prevalence of each varies by age group, geographical area and the scenario where cases (community vs hospital) are recorded. The most relevant pathogens in public health are those associated with the highest burden of disease, severity, complications and mortality. In our country, norovirus, Campylobacter and diarrheagenic E. coli are the most prevalent pathogens at the community level in children. In this paper we review the local epidemiology and potential areas of development in five selected pathogens: rotavirus, norovirus, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), Shigella and Salmonella. Of these, rotavirus is the most important in the pediatric population and the main agent responsible for child mortality from diarrhea. The introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Peru will have a significant impact on disease burden and mortality from diarrhea. However, surveillance studies are needed to determine the impact of vaccination and changes in the epidemiology of diarrhea in Peru following the introduction of new vaccines, as well as antibiotic resistance surveillance of clinical relevant bacteria.","['Riveros M', 'Ochoa TJ']",2015,32,1,Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,Riveros M and Ochoa TJ.

26068698,The Rising Dominance of Shigella sonnei: An Intercontinental Shift in the Etiology of Bacillary Dysentery.,"Shigellosis is the major global cause of dysentery. Shigella sonnei, which has historically been more commonly isolated in developed countries, is undergoing an unprecedented expansion across industrializing regions in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The precise reasons underpinning the epidemiological distribution of the various Shigella species and this global surge in S. sonnei are unclear but may be due to three major environmental pressures. First, natural passive immunization with the bacterium Plesiomonas shigelloides is hypothesized to protect populations with poor water supplies against S. sonnei. Improving the quality of drinking water supplies would, therefore, result in a reduction in P. shigelloides exposure and a subsequent reduction in environmental immunization against S. sonnei. Secondly, the ubiquitous amoeba species Acanthamoeba castellanii has been shown to phagocytize S. sonnei efficiently and symbiotically, thus allowing the bacteria access to a protected niche in which to withstand chlorination and other harsh environmental conditions in temperate countries. Finally, S. sonnei has emerged from Europe and begun to spread globally only relatively recently. A strong selective pressure from localized antimicrobial use additionally appears to have had a dramatic impact on the evolution of the S. sonnei population. We hypothesize that S. sonnei, which exhibits an exceptional ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance genes from commensal and pathogenic bacteria, has a competitive advantage over S. flexneri, particularly in areas with poorly regulated antimicrobial use. Continuing improvement in the quality of global drinking water supplies alongside the rapid development of antimicrobial resistance predicts the burden and international distribution of S. sonnei will only continue to grow. An effective vaccine against S. sonnei is overdue and may become one of our only weapons against this increasingly dominant and problematic gastrointestinal pathogen.","['Thompson CN', 'Duy PT', 'Baker S']",2015,9,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Thompson CN, et al.

26058758,Immunological Biomarkers in Postinfectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: There is a recognized need for biological markers to facilitate diagnoses of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to distinguish it from other functional and organic disorders. As postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS) is believed to account for as many as one third of all IBS cases, here we sought to identify differences in specific cytokines and serologic responses across patients with idiopathic IBS and PI-IBS and healthy controls.
METHODS: At total of 120 US military personnel were identified from the Defense Medical Surveillance System-based International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) codes recorded during medical encounters and were grouped based on infectious gastroenteritis (IGE) episode (Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, or an unspecified pathogen) followed by IBS, IBS without antecedent IGE, or IGE without subsequent IBS within 2 years of the IGE exposure. Sera from subjects were assayed for cytokine levels and antibodies against a panel of microbiome antigens.
RESULTS: In total, 10 of 118 markers considered were shown to differ between IBS patients and healthy controls, including cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1β, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), as well as antibody responses to microbial antigens. Antimicrobial antibody response profiles also differed between PI-IBS cases compared with IBS cases without an antecedent episode of acute IGE. Comparisons also suggest that immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG profiles may point to pathogen-specific origins among PI-IBS cases.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results provide further evidence as to the molecular distinctness of classes of IBS cases and that serum biomarkers may prove useful in elucidating their pathobiological pathways.","['Pike BL', 'Paden KA', 'Alcala AN', 'Jaep KM', 'Gormley RP', 'Maue AC', 'Christmann BS', 'Elson CO', 'Riddle MS', 'Porter CK']",2015,22,4,J Travel Med,"Pike BL, et al.

26056271,Bioimage analysis of Shigella infection reveals targeting of colonic crypts.,"Few studies within the pathogenic field have used advanced imaging and analytical tools to quantitatively measure pathogenicity in vivo. In this work, we present a novel approach for the investigation of host-pathogen processes based on medium-throughput 3D fluorescence imaging. The guinea pig model for Shigella flexneri invasion of the colonic mucosa was used to monitor the infectious process over time with GFP-expressing S. flexneri. A precise quantitative imaging protocol was devised to follow individual S. flexneri in a large tissue volume. An extensive dataset of confocal images was obtained and processed to extract specific quantitative information regarding the progression of S. flexneri infection in an unbiased and exhaustive manner. Specific parameters included the analysis of S. flexneri positions relative to the epithelial surface, S. flexneri density within the tissue, and volume of tissue destruction. In particular, at early time points, there was a clear association of S. flexneri with crypts, key morphological features of the colonic mucosa. Numerical simulations based on random bacterial entry confirmed the bias of experimentally measured S. flexneri for early crypt targeting. The application of a correlative light and electron microscopy technique adapted for thick tissue samples further confirmed the location of S. flexneri within colonocytes at the mouth of crypts. This quantitative imaging approach is a novel means to examine host-pathogen systems in a tailored and robust manner, inclusive of the infectious agent.","['Arena ET', 'Campbell-Valois FX', 'Tinevez JY', 'Nigro G', 'Sachse M', 'Moya-Nilges M', 'Nothelfer K', 'Marteyn B', 'Shorte SL', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2015,112,25,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Arena ET, et al.

26045331,The association between diurnal temperature range and childhood bacillary dysentery.,"Previous studies have found that mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures were associated with bacillary dysentery (BD). However, little is known about whether the within-day variation of temperature has any impact on bacillary dysentery. The current study aimed to identify the relationship between diurnal temperature range (DTR) and BD in Hefei, China. Daily data on BD counts among children aged 0-14 years from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2012 were retrieved from Hefei Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Daily data on ambient temperature and relative humidity covering the same period were collected from the Hefei Bureau of Meteorology. A Poisson generalized linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used in the analysis after controlling the effects of season, long-term trends, mean temperature, and relative humidity. The results showed that there existed a statistically significant relationship between DTR and childhood BD. The DTR effect on childhood bacillary dysentery increased when DTR was over 8 °C. And it was greatest at 1-day lag, with an 8% (95% CI = 2.9-13.4%) increase of BD cases per 5 °C increment of DTR. Male children and children aged 0-5 years appeared to be more vulnerable to the DTR effect. The data indicate that large DTR may increase the incidence of childhood BD. Caregivers and health practitioners should be made aware of the potential threat posed by large DTR. Therefore, DTR should be taken into consideration when making targeted health policies and programs to protect children from being harmed by climate impacts.","['Wen LY', 'Zhao KF', 'Cheng J', 'Wang X', 'Yang HH', 'Li KS', 'Xu ZW', 'Su H']",2016,60,2,Int J Biometeorol,"Wen LY, et al.

26042182,Draft genomes of Shigella strains used by the STOPENTERICS consortium.,"BACKGROUND: Despite a significant global burden of disease, there is still no vaccine against shigellosis widely available. One aim of the European Union funded STOPENTERICS consortium is to develop vaccine candidates against Shigella. Given the importance of translational vaccine coverage, here we aimed to characterise the Shigella strains being used by the consortium by whole genome sequencing, and report on the stability of strains cultured in different laboratories or through serial passage.
METHODS: We sequenced, de novo assembled and annotated 20 Shigella strains being used by the consortium. These comprised 16 different isolates belonging to 7 serotypes, and 4 derivative strains. Derivative strains from common isolates were manipulated in different laboratories or had undergone multiple passages in the same laboratory. Strains were mapped against reference genomes to detect SNP variation and phylogenetic analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The genomes assembled into similar total lengths (range 4.14-4.83 Mbp) and had similar numbers of predicted coding sequences (average of 4,400). Mapping analysis showed the genetic stability of strains through serial passages and culturing in different laboratories, as well as varying levels of similarity to published reference genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three main clades among the strains and published references, one containing the Shigella flexneri serotype 6 strains, a second containing the remaining S. flexneri serotypes and a third comprised of Shigella sonnei strains.
CONCLUSIONS: This work increases the number of the publically available Shigella genomes available and specifically provides information on strains being used for vaccine development by STOPENTERICS. It also provides information on the variability among strains maintained in different laboratories and through serial passage. This work will guide the selection of strains for further vaccine development.","['Rossi O', 'Baker KS', 'Phalipon A', 'Weill FX', 'Citiulo F', 'Sansonetti P', 'Gerke C', 'Thomson NR']",2015,7,,Gut Pathog,"Rossi O, et al.

26039698,Antimicrobial Resistance of Shigella flexneri Serotype 1b Isolates in China.,"Shigella flexneri serotype 1b is among the most prominent serotypes in developing countries, followed by serotype 2a. However, only limited data is available on the global phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of S. flexneri 1b. In the present study, 40 S. flexneri 1b isolates from different regions of China were confirmed by serotyping and biochemical characterization. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 85% of these isolates were multidrug-resistant strains and antibiotic susceptibility profiles varied between geographical locations. Strains from Yunnan were far more resistant than those from Xinjiang, while only one strain from Shanghai was resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam. Fifteen cephalosporin resistant isolates were identified in this study. ESBL genes (blaSHV, blaTEM, blaOXA, and blaCTX-M) and ampC genes (blaMOX, blaFOX, blaMIR(ACT-1), blaDHA, blaCIT and blaACC) were subsequently detected among the 15 isolates. The results showed that these strains were positive only for blaTEM, blaOXA, blaCTX-M, intI1, and intI2. Furthermore, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that the 40 isolates formed different profiles, and the PFGE patterns of Xinjiang isolates were distinct from Yunnan and Shanghai isolates by one obvious, large, missing band. In summary, similarities in resistance patterns were observed in strains with the same PFGE pattern. Overall, the results supported the need for more prudent selection and use of antibiotics in China. We suggest that antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed at the start of an outbreak, and antibiotic use should be restricted to severe Shigella cases, based on resistance pattern variations observed in different regions. The data obtained in the current study might help to develop a strategy for the treatment of infections caused by S. flexneri 1b in China.","['Cui X', 'Yang C', 'Wang J', 'Liang B', 'Yi S', 'Li H', 'Liu H', 'Li P', 'Wu Z', 'Xie J', 'Jia L', 'Hao R', 'Wang L', 'Hua Y', 'Qiu S', 'Song H']",2015,10,6,PLoS One,"Cui X, et al.

Resistance levels were high to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (86%), tetracycline (74%), ampicillin (67%), and chloramphenicol (65%). Six isolates showed decreased azithromycin susceptibility. No isolate was resistant to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, or ceftriaxone. The most frequent resistance genes were sul2 (95%), tet(B) (92%), cat (80%), dfrA1 (47%), blaOXA-1like (40%), with intl1 and intl2 detected in 51 and 52% of the isolates, respectively. Thirty-one different VF profiles were observed, being the ipaH (100%), sen (77%), virA and icsA (75%) genes the most frequently found. Differences in the prevalence of VF were observed between species with S. flexneri isolates, particularly serotype 2a, possessing high numbers of VF. In conclusion, this study highlights the high heterogeneity of Shigella VF and resistance genes, and prevalence of MDR organisms within this geographic region.","['Lluque A', 'Mosquito S', 'Gomes C', 'Riveros M', 'Durand D', 'Tilley DH', 'Bernal M', 'Prada A', 'Ochoa TJ', 'Ruiz J']",2015,305,4-5,Int J Med Microbiol,"Lluque A, et al.

25989168,Effect of combination therapy between thyme oil and ciprofloxacin on ulcer-forming Shigella flexneri.,"INTRODUCTION: Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative bacteria that has the ability to invade the epithelium of the colon and cause colon ulcers.
METHODOLOGY: The ability of isolated Shigella flexneri from bloody diarrhea to cause colon ulcers was investigated by histopathological examination via oral administration of the bacteria to adult male albino Sprague-Dawley rats. The antibacterial activity of thyme oil, ciprofloxacin, and their combination were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Oral administration of 12×108 CFU/mL of S. flexneri was able to cause colon ulcers. Thyme oil had the highest antibacterial activity among other investigated oils (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 150µL/L). Ciprofloxacin had the highest antimicrobial activity against S. flexneri (MIC 0.4mg/L). The synergism between thyme oil and ciprofloxacin showed the maximum growth inhibition of S. flexneri. The synergistic activity of thyme oil and ciprofloxacin succeeded in healing the epithelial surface of the colon and decreased the inflammation of the lamina propria; it also decreased the bacterial load in the infected colon, while the commercial drug failed to heal the colon ulcer. Thyme oil, ciprofloxacin, and their combination showed different degrees of effects on the bacterial cell structure by transmission and scanning electron microscopes.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of thyme oil and ciprofloxacin gave synergistic activity, which proved to be more effective in inhibiting the growth of ulcer-forming S. flexneri, healing the colon ulcer, and decreasing infiltration of the lamina propria with inflammatory cells.","['Allam NG', 'Eldrieny EA', 'Mohamed AZ']",2015,9,5,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Allam NG, et al.

25951081,What Glues a Homodimer Together: Systematic Analysis of the Stabilizing Effect of an Aromatic Hot Spot in the Protein-Protein Interface of the tRNA-Modifying Enzyme Tgt.,"Shigella bacteria constitute the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, an acute inflammatory disease causing the death of more than one million humans per year. A null mutation in the tgt gene encoding the tRNA-modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) was found to drastically decrease the pathogenicity of Shigella bacteria, suggesting the use of Tgt as putative target for selective antibiotics. The enzyme is only functionally active as a homodimer; thus, interference with the formation of its protein-protein interface is an attractive opportunity for therapeutic intervention. To better understand the driving forces responsible for the assembly, stability, and formation of the homodimer, we studied the properties of the residues that establish the dimer interface in detail. We performed site-directed mutagenesis and controlled shifts in the monomer/dimer equilibrium ratio in solution in a concentration-dependent manner by native mass spectrometry and used crystal structure analysis to elucidate the geometrical modulations resulting from mutational variations. The wild-type enzyme exhibits nearly exclusive dimer geometry. A patch of four aromatic amino acids, embedded into a ring of hydrophobic residues and further stabilized by a network of H-bonds, is essential for the stability of the dimer's contact. Accordingly, any perturbance in the constitution of this aromatic patch by nonaromatic residues reduces dimer stability significantly, with some of these exchanges resulting in a nearly exclusively monomeric state. Apart from the aromatic hot spot, the interface comprises an extended loop-helix motif that exhibits remarkable flexibility. In the destabilized mutated variants, the loop-helix motif adopts deviating conformations in the interface region, and a number of water molecules, penetrating into the interface, are observed.","['Jakobi S', 'Nguyen PT', 'Debaene F', 'Cianférani S', 'Reuter K', 'Klebe G']",2015,10,8,ACS Chem Biol,"Jakobi S, et al.

25946209,High mean water vapour pressure promotes the transmission of bacillary dysentery.,"Bacillary dysentery is an infectious disease caused by Shigella dysenteriae, which has a seasonal distribution. External environmental factors, including climate, play a significant role in its transmission. This paper identifies climate-related risk factors and their role in bacillary dysentery transmission. Harbin, in northeast China, with a temperate climate, and Quzhou, in southern China, with a subtropical climate, are chosen as the study locations. The least absolute shrinkage and selectionator operator is applied to select relevant climate factors involved in the transmission of bacillary dysentery. Based on the selected relevant climate factors and incidence rates, an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is established successfully as a time series prediction model. The numerical results demonstrate that the mean water vapour pressure over the previous month results in a high relative risk for bacillary dysentery transmission in both cities, and the ARIMA model can successfully perform such a prediction. These results provide better explanations for the relationship between climate factors and bacillary dysentery transmission than those put forth in other studies that use only correlation coefficients or fitting models. The findings in this paper demonstrate that the mean water vapour pressure over the previous month is an important predictor for the transmission of bacillary dysentery.","['Li GZ', 'Shao FF', 'Zhang H', 'Zou CP', 'Li HH', 'Jin J']",2015,10,5,PLoS One,"Li GZ, et al.

There are no licensed Shigella vaccines and glycoconjugates are among the leading candidate vaccines against shigellosis today. We used whole genome sequence analysis (WGA) to find out whether immunization, with an investigational Shigella sonnei glycoconjugate, could induce selective pressure leading to changes in the genome of S. sonnei. An outbreak of culture-proven S. sonnei shigellosis which occurred immediately after vaccination in one of the cohorts of volunteers participating in a phase III trial of the vaccine in Israel created a unique condition in which the epidemic agent ""co-existed"" with the developing immune responses induced by the vaccine and natural infection among vaccinees who developed S. sonnei shigellosis. By comparing the whole genomes of S. sonnei isolated from vaccinees and from volunteers in the control group, we show at a very high sensitivity that a potent S. sonnei glycoconjugate that conferred 74% protective efficacy against the homologous disease did not induce changes in the genome of S. sonnei and in particular on the O-antigen gene cluster.","['Behar A', 'Fookes MC', 'Goren S', 'Thomson NR', 'Cohen D']",2015,33,26,Vaccine,"Behar A, et al.

25936611,Intercontinental dissemination of azithromycin-resistant shigellosis through sexual transmission: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is an acute, severe bacterial colitis that, in high-income countries, is typically associated with travel to high-risk regions (Africa, Asia, and Latin America). Since the 1970s, shigellosis has also been reported as a sexually transmitted infection in men who have sex with men (MSM), in whom transmission is an important component of shigellosis epidemiology in high-income nations. We aimed to use sophisticated subtyping and international sampling to determine factors driving shigellosis emergence in MSM linked to an outbreak in the UK.
METHODS: We did a large-scale, cross-sectional genomic epidemiological study of shigellosis cases collected from 29 countries between December, 1995, and June 8, 2014. Focusing on an ongoing epidemic in the UK, we collected and whole-genome sequenced clinical isolates of Shigella flexneri serotype 3a from high-risk and low-risk regions, including cases associated with travel and sex between men. We examined relationships between geographical, demographic, and clinical patient data with the isolate antimicrobial susceptibility, genetic data, and inferred evolutionary relationships.
FINDINGS: We obtained 331 clinical isolates of S flexneri serotype 3a, including 275 from low-risk regions (44 from individuals who travelled to high-risk regions), 52 from high-risk regions, and four outgroup samples (ie, closely related, but genetically distinct isolates used to determine the root of the phylogenetic tree). We identified a recently emerged lineage of S flexneri 3a that has spread intercontinentally in less than 20 years throughout regions traditionally at low risk for shigellosis via sexual transmission in MSM. The lineage had acquired multiple antimicrobial resistance determinants, and prevailing sublineages were strongly associated with resistance to the macrolide azithromycin. Eight (4%) of 206 isolates from the MSM-associated lineage were obtained from patients who had previously provided an isolate; these serial isolations indicated atypical infection patterns (eg, reinfection).
INTERPRETATION: We identified transmission-facilitating behaviours and atypical course(s) of infection as precipitating factors in shigellosis-affected MSM. The intercontinental spread of antimicrobial-resistant shigella through established transmission routes emphasises the need for new approaches to tackle the public health challenge of sexually transmitted infections in MSM.

METHODS: All men aged ≥18 years diagnosed with S flexneri 3a between October 2012 and May 2013 were invited to participate. Semistructured in-depth quantitative interviews were conducted to explore lifestyle and sexual behaviour factors.
RESULTS: Of 53 men diagnosed, 42 were interviewed of whom 34 were sexually active MSM. High numbers of sexual partners were reported (median=22) within the previous year; most were casual encounters met through social media networking sites (21/34). 63% (20/32) were HIV-positive and actively sought positive partners for condomless sex. 62% (21/34) of men had used chemsex drugs (mephedrone, crystal methamphetamine and γ-butyrolactone/γ-hydroxybutrate), which facilitate sexually disinhibiting behaviour during sexual encounters. 38% (8/21) reported injecting chemsex drugs. Where reported almost half (12/23) had attended or hosted sex parties. All reported oral-anal contact and fisting was common (16/34). Many had had gonorrhoea (23/34) and chlamydia (17/34). HIV-positive serostatus was associated with both insertive anal intercourse with a casual partner and receptive fisting (adjusted OR=15.0, p=0.01; adjusted OR=18.3, p=0.03) as was the use of web applications that promote and facilitate unprotected sex (adjusted OR=19.8, p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-positive MSM infected with S flexneri 3a used social media to meet sexual partners for unprotected sex mainly at sex parties. The potential for the transmission of S flexneri, HIV and other infections is clear. MSM need to be aware of the effect that chemsex drugs have on their health.","['Gilbart VL', 'Simms I', 'Jenkins C', 'Furegato M', 'Gobin M', 'Oliver I', 'Hart G', 'Gill ON', 'Hughes G']",2015,91,8,Sex Transm Infect,"Gilbart VL, et al.

25912807,Rapid and reliable discrimination between Shigella species and Escherichia coli using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.,"E. coli-Shigella species are a cryptic group of bacteria in which the Shigella species are distributed within the phylogenetic tree of E. coli. The nomenclature is historically based and the discrimination of these genera developed as a result of the epidemiological need to identify the cause of shigellosis, a severe disease caused by Shigella species. For these reasons, this incorrect classification of shigellae persists to date, and the ability to rapidly characterize E. coli and Shigella species remains highly desirable. Until recently, existing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) assays used to identify bacteria could not discriminate between E. coli and Shigella species. Here we present a rapid classification method for the E. coli-Shigella phylogroup based on MALDI-TOF MS which is supported by genetic analysis. E. coli and Shigella isolates were collected and genetically characterized by MLVA. A custom reference library for MALDI-TOF MS that represents the genetic diversity of E. coli and Shigella strains was developed. Characterization of E. coli and Shigella species is based on an approach with Biotyper software. Using this reference library it was possible to distinguish between Shigella species and E. coli. Of the 180 isolates tested, 94.4% were correctly classified as E. coli or shigellae. The results of four (2.2%) isolates could not be interpreted and six (3.3%) isolates were classified incorrectly. The custom library extends the existing MALDI-TOF MS method for species determination by enabling rapid and accurate discrimination between Shigella species and E. coli.","['Paauw A', 'Jonker D', 'Roeselers G', 'Heng JM', 'Mars-Groenendijk RH', 'Trip H', 'Molhoek EM', 'Jansen HJ', 'van der Plas J', 'de Jong AL', 'Majchrzykiewicz-Koehorst JA', 'Speksnijder AG']",2015,305,4-5,Int J Med Microbiol,"Paauw A, et al.

25902138,"Identification and Molecular Characterisation of a Novel Mu-Like Bacteriophage, SfMu, of Shigella flexneri.","S. flexneri is the leading cause of bacillary dysentery in the developing countries. Several temperate phages originating from this host have been characterised. However, all S. flexneri phages known to date are lambdoid phages, which have the ability to confer the O-antigen modification of their host. In this study, we report the isolation and characterisation of a novel Mu-like phage from a serotype 4a strain of S. flexneri. The genome of phage SfMu is composed of 37,146 bp and is predicted to contain 55 open reading frames (orfs). Comparative genome analysis of phage SfMu with Mu and other Mu-like phages revealed that SfMu is closely related to phage Mu, sharing >90% identity with majority of its proteins. Moreover, investigation of phage SfMu receptor on the surface of the host cell revealed that the O-antigen of the host serves as the receptor for the adsorption of phage SfMu. This study also demonstrates pervasiveness of SfMu phage in S. flexneri, by identifying complete SfMu prophage strains of serotype X and Y, and remnants of SfMu in strains belonging to 4 other serotypes, thereby indicating that transposable phages in S. flexneri are not uncommon.

25848798,Shigella infection interferes with SUMOylation and increases PML-NB number.,"Shigellosis is a severe diarrheal disease that affects hundreds of thousands of individuals resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Shigellosis is caused by Shigella spp., a gram-negative bacterium that uses a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) to deliver effector proteins into the cytosol of infected human cells. Shigella infection triggers multiple signaling programs that result in a robust host transcriptional response that includes the induction of multiple proinflammatory cytokines. PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are dynamic subnuclear structures that coordinate immune signaling programs and have a demonstrated role in controlling viral infection. We show that PML-NB number increases upon Shigella infection. We examined the effects of Shigella infection on SUMOylation and found that upon Shigella infection the localization of SUMOylated proteins is altered and the level of SUMOylated proteins decreases. Although Shigella infection does not alter the abundance of SUMO activating enzymes SAE1 or SAE2, it dramatically decreases the level of the SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9. All Shigella-induced alterations to the SUMOylation system are dependent upon a T3SS. Thus, we demonstrate that Shigella uses one or more T3SS effectors to influence both PML-NB number and the SUMOylation machinery in human cells.","['Sidik SM', 'Salsman J', 'Dellaire G', 'Rohde JR']",2015,10,4,PLoS One,"Sidik SM, et al.

25811616,Distinct mutations led to inactivation of type 1 fimbriae expression in Shigella spp.,"Shigella spp. are responsible for bacillary dysentery in humans. The acquisition or the modification of the virulence plasmid encoding factors promoting entry of bacteria into and dissemination within epithelial cells was a critical step in the evolution of these bacteria from their Escherichia coli ancestor(s). Incorporation of genomic islands (GI) and gene inactivation also shaped interactions between these pathogens and their human host. Sequence analysis of the GI inserted next to the leuX tRNA gene in S. boydii, S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. sonnei and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) suggests that this region initially carried the fec, yjhATS and fim gene clusters. The fim cluster encoding type I fimbriae is systematically inactivated in both reference strains and clinical isolates and distinct mutations are responsible for this inactivation in at least three phylogenetic groups. To investigate consequences of the presence of fimbriae on the outcome of the interaction of Shigella with host cells, we used a S. flexneri strain harboring a plasmid encoding the E. coli fim operon. Production of fimbriae by this recombinant strain increased the ability of bacteria to adhere to and enter into epithelial cells and had no effect on their ability to disseminate from cell to cell. The observations that production of type I fimbriae increases invasion of epithelial cells and that independent mutations abolish fimbriae production in Shigella suggest that these mutations correspond to pathoadaptive events.","['Bravo V', 'Puhar A', 'Sansonetti P', 'Parsot C', 'Toro CS']",2015,10,3,PLoS One,"Bravo V, et al.

25776843,Shigella IpaB and IpaD displayed on L. lactis bacterium-like particles induce protective immunity in adult and infant mice.,"Shigella spp. are among the enteric pathogens with the highest attributable incidence of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in children under 5 years of age living in endemic areas. There are no vaccines available to prevent this disease. In this work, we investigated a new Shigella vaccine concept consisting of nonliving, self-adjuvanted, Lactococcus lactis bacterium-like particles (BLP) displaying Shigella invasion plasmid antigen (Ipa) B and IpaD and examined its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in adult and newborn/infant mice immunized via the nasal route. Unique advantages of this approach include the potential for broad protection due to the highly conserved structure of the Ipas and the safety and practicality of a probiotic-based mucosal/adjuvant delivery platform. Immunization of adult mice with BLP-IpaB and BLP-IpaD (BLP-IpaB/D) induced high levels of Ipa-specific serum IgG and stool IgA in a dose-dependent manner. Immune responses and protection were enhanced by BLP delivery. Vaccine-induced serum antibodies exhibited opsonophagocytic and cytotoxic neutralizing activity, and IpaB/D IgG titers correlated with increased survival post-challenge. Ipa-specific antibody secreting cells were detected in nasal tissue and lungs, as well as IgG in bronchoalveolar lavage. Bone marrow cells produced IpaB/D-specific antibodies and contributed to protection after adoptive transfer. The BLP-IpaB/D vaccine conferred 90% and 80% protection against S. flexneri and S. sonnei, respectively. Mice immunized with BLP-IpaB/D as newborns also developed IpaB and IpaD serum antibodies; 90% were protected against S. flexneri and 44% against S. sonnei. The BLP-IpaB/D vaccine is a promising candidate for safe, practical and potentially effective immunization of children against shigellosis.","['Heine SJ', 'Franco-Mahecha OL', 'Chen X', 'Choudhari S', 'Blackwelder WC', 'van Roosmalen ML', 'Leenhouts K', 'Picking WL', 'Pasetti MF']",2015,93,7,Immunol Cell Biol,"Heine SJ, et al.

These new tests do not yield isolates that are currently needed for further tests to distinguish among strains or subtypes of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and other organisms. Public health surveillance relies on this detailed characterization of isolates to monitor trends and rapidly detect outbreaks; consequently, the increased use of CIDTs makes prevention and control of these infections more difficult. During 2012-2013, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet*) identified a total of 38,666 culture-confirmed cases and positive CIDT reports of Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Vibrio, and Yersinia. Among the 5,614 positive CIDT reports, 2,595 (46%) were not confirmed by culture. In addition, a 2014 survey of clinical laboratories serving the FoodNet surveillance area indicated that use of CIDTs by the laboratories varied by pathogen; only CIDT methods were used most often for detection of Campylobacter (10%) and STEC (19%). Maintaining surveillance of bacterial enteric infections in this period of transition will require enhanced surveillance methods and strategies for obtaining bacterial isolates.","['Iwamoto M', 'Huang JY', 'Cronquist AB', 'Medus C', 'Hurd S', 'Zansky S', 'Dunn J', 'Woron AM', 'Oosmanally N', 'Griffin PM', 'Besser J', 'Henao OL', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']",2015,64,9,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Iwamoto M, et al.

25673655,Virulence variations in Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli using the Caenorhabditis elegans model.,"Shigella species and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) belong to the same species genetically, with remarkable phenotypic and genomic similarities. Shigella is the main cause of bacillary dysentery with around 160 million annual cases, while EIEC generally induces a milder disease compared to Shigella. This study aimed to determine virulence variations between Shigella and EIEC using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model host. Caenorhabditis elegans killing- and bacterial colonization assays were performed to examine the potential difference in virulence between Shigella and EIEC strains. Statistically significant difference in the survival rates of nematodes was demonstrated, with Shigella causing death at 88.24 ± 1.20% and EIEC at 94.37 ± 0.70%. The intestinal load of bacteria in the nematodes was found to be 7.65 × 10(4) ± 8.83 × 10(3) and 2.92 × 10(4) ± 6.26 × 10(3) CFU ml(-1) per nematode for Shigella and EIEC, respectively. Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 which carries the Shiga toxin showed the lowest nematode survival rate at 82.6 ± 3.97% and highest bacterial colonization of 1.75 × 10(5) ± 8.17 × 10(4) CFU ml(-1), whereas a virulence plasmid-negative Shigella strain demonstrated 100 ± 0% nematode survival and lowest bacterial accumulation of 1.02 × 10(4) ± 7.23 × 10(2) CFU ml(-1).

25667265,The class II phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase PIK3C2A promotes Shigella flexneri dissemination through formation of vacuole-like protrusions.,"Intracellular pathogens such as Shigella flexneri and Listeria monocytogenes achieve dissemination in the intestinal epithelium by displaying actin-based motility in the cytosol of infected cells. As they reach the cell periphery, motile bacteria form plasma membrane protrusions that resolve into vacuoles in adjacent cells, through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we report on the role of the class II phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase PIK3C2A in S. flexneri dissemination. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that PIK3C2A was required for the resolution of protrusions into vacuoles through the formation of an intermediate membrane-bound compartment that we refer to as a vacuole-like protrusion (VLP). Genetic rescue of PIK3C2A depletion with RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant cDNA constructs demonstrated that VLP formation required the activity of PIK3C2A in primary infected cells. PIK3C2A expression was required for production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] at the plasma membrane surrounding protrusions. PtdIns(3)P production was not observed in the protrusions formed by L. monocytogenes, whose dissemination did not rely on PIK3C2A. PIK3C2A-mediated PtdIns(3)P production in S. flexneri protrusions was regulated by host cell tyrosine kinase signaling and relied on the integrity of the S. flexneri type 3 secretion system (T3SS). We suggest a model of S. flexneri dissemination in which the formation of VLPs is mediated by the PIK3C2A-dependent production of the signaling lipid PtdIns(3)P in the protrusion membrane, which relies on the T3SS-dependent activation of tyrosine kinase signaling in protrusions.","['Dragoi AM', 'Agaisse H']",2015,83,4,Infect Immun,Dragoi AM and Agaisse H.

25656740,"Shigella flexneri serotype 1 infections in men who have sex with men in Vancouver, Canada.","OBJECTIVES: Outbreaks of shigellosis have been documented in men who have sex with men (MSM), associated with interpersonal transmission and underlying HIV infection. We observed a rise in Shigella flexneri isolates identified in a downtown tertiary-care hospital laboratory located within the city centre community health area (CHA-1) of Vancouver, Canada. The objectives of this study were to evaluate clinical outcomes of shigellosis cases among MSM admitted to hospital and to evaluate trends in Shigella cases within Vancouver, Canada.
METHODS: Adult rates of shigellosis were analysed by gender and health region, from 2005 to 2011, followed by retrospective chart review of all hospital laboratory-identified S. flexneri cases from 2008 to 2012. Serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed on these isolates.
RESULTS: Although shigellosis rates in men within CHA-1 did not change from 2005 to 2011 (range 33.4-68.5 per 100 000; P = 0.74), they were significantly higher than in other regions within the city of Vancouver (P ≤ 0.001) and the province of British Columbia (P ≤ 0.001). Shigella flexneri rates in men within CHA-1 increased significantly (range 2.3-51.4 per 100 000; P < 0.001), starting in 2008, and were higher than in other regions within Vancouver (P ≤ 0.01). Seventy-nine isolates of S. flexneri from 72 patients were identified by a single hospital laboratory. All patients were male and predominantly MSM (91.7%) and HIV-infected (86.1%), with most (92.6%) demonstrating CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/μL. In total, 38.0% required hospitalization. Most (87.3%) had S. flexneri serotype 1 infection, with 72.9% of these representing a single PFGE pattern.

25651919,Shigella outer membrane protein PSSP-1 is broadly protective against Shigella infection.,"In developing countries, Shigella is a primary cause of diarrhea in infants and young children. Although antibiotic therapy is an effective treatment for shigellosis, therapeutic options are narrowing due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Thus, preventive vaccination could become the most efficacious approach for controlling shigellosis. We have identified several conserved protein antigens that are shared by multiple Shigella serotypes and species. Among these, one antigen induced cross-protection against experimental shigellosis, and we have named it pan-Shigella surface protein 1 (PSSP-1). PSSP-1-induced protection requires a mucosal administration route and coadministration of an adjuvant. When PSSP-1 was administered intranasally, it induced cross-protection against Shigella flexneri serotypes 2a, 5a, and 6, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei, and Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1. Intradermally administered PSSP-1 induced strong serum antibody responses but failed to induce protection in the mouse lung pneumonia model. In contrast, intranasal administration elicited efficient local and systemic antibody responses and production of interleukin 17A and gamma interferon. Interestingly, blood samples from patients with recent-onset shigellosis showed variable but significant mucosal antibody responses to other conserved Shigella protein antigens but not to PSSP-1. We suggest that PSSP-1 is a promising antigen for a broadly protective vaccine against Shigella.","['Kim JO', 'Rho S', 'Kim SH', 'Kim H', 'Song HJ', 'Kim EJ', 'Kim RY', 'Kim EH', 'Sinha A', 'Dey A', 'Yang JS', 'Song MK', 'Nandy RK', 'Czerkinsky C', 'Kim DW']",2015,22,4,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Kim JO, et al.

25640657,Co-administration of rIpaB domain of Shigella with rGroEL of S. Typhi enhances the immune responses and protective efficacy against Shigella infection.,"Shigella species cause severe bacillary dysentery in humans and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The Invasion plasmid antigen (IpaB) protein, which is conserved across all Shigella spp., induces macrophage cell death and is required to invade host cells. The present study evaluates the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the recombinant (r) domain region of IpaB (rIpaB) of S. flexneri. rIpaB was administered either alone or was co-administered with the rGroEL (heat shock protein 60) protein from S. Typhi as an adjuvant in a mouse model of intranasal immunization. The IpaB domain region (37 kDa) of S. flexneri was amplified from an invasion plasmid, cloned, expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells and purified. Immunization with the rIpaB domain alone stimulated both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, robust antibody (IgG, IgA) and T-cell responses were induced when the rIpaB domain was co-administered with rGroEL. Antibody isotyping revealed higher IgG1 and IgG2a antibody titers and increased interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) secretion in the co-administered group. Immunization of mice with the rIpaB domain alone protected 60%-70% of the mice from lethal infection by S. flexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei, whereas co-administration with rGroEL increased the protective efficacy to 80%-85%. Organ burden and histopathological studies also revealed a significant reduction in lung infection in the co-immunized mice compared with mice immunized with the rIpaB domain alone. This study emphasizes that the co-administration of the rIpaB domain and rGroEL protein improves immune responses in mice and increases protective efficacy against Shigella infection. This is also the first report to evaluate the potential of the GroEL (Hsp 60) protein of S.

We developed a model to quantitatively assess reporting timeliness. Using reporting speed data for 6 infectious diseases in the notification system in the Netherlands, we calculated the proportion of infections produced by index and secondary cases until the index case is reported. We assumed interventions that immediately stop transmission. Reporting delays render useful only those interventions that stop transmission from index and secondary cases. We found that current reporting delays are adequate for hepatitis A and B control. However, reporting delays should be reduced by a few days to improve measles and mumps control, by at least 10 days to improve shigellosis control, and by at least 5 weeks to substantially improve pertussis control. Our method provides quantitative insight into the required reporting delay reductions needed to achieve outbreak control and other transmission prevention goals.","['Bonačić Marinović A', 'Swaan C', 'van Steenbergen J', 'Kretzschmar M']",2015,21,2,Emerg Infect Dis,"Bonačić Marinović A, et al.

However, the genetic characteristics of circulating isolates are unknown. Phenotypic and molecular profiles of 60 S. flexneri isolates recovered in Guizhou between 1972 to 1982 and 2008 to 2010 were determined. Nine serotypes (1a, 2a, 3a, 1b, 2b, X, Y, 4av and Yv) were identified. Multi-locus sequence typing differentiated the isolates into 20 sequence types (STs); 18 were novel. Four STs, ST 129, ST 100, ST 126 and ST 18, were most abundant, accounting for 65% of the isolates. Thirty-nine NotI-pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns (pulsotypes, PTs) were observed; eight PTs were represented by more than one isolate with six isolates sharing the PT 13 profile. Multi-locus variable-nucleotide tandem-repeat analysis recognized 44 different types (MTs); seven MTs were represented by more than one isolate and MT 1 was most commonly encountered. Correlation between genetic relationships and serotypes was observed among the isolates studied; the majority of isolates belonging to the same serotype from different years clustered together based on the molecular data.

25616876,"Prevalence of intestinal parasites, salmonella and shigella among apparently health food handlers of Addis Ababa University student's cafeteria, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.","BACKGROUND: Food contamination may occur at any point during its journey through production, processing, distribution, and preparation. The risk of food getting contaminated depends largely on the health status of the food handlers, their personal hygiene, knowledge and practice of food hygiene. Food borne diseases are a public health problem in developed and developing countries like Ethiopia.
METHOD: A cross sectional study was conducted among food handlers in Addis Ababa student's cafeteria from January to May 2013. Structured questionnaire was used to collect socio demographic data and associated risk factors. Stool specimens were examined for bacteria and intestinal parasites following standard procedures. Biochemical tests were done to identify the species of bacterial isolates. Sensitivity testing was done using Kirby- Baur disk diffusion method.
RESULT: A total of 172 food handlers were enrolled in the study. The majority of study participants were females 134 (77.9%). About 78 (45.3%) of food handlers were found to be positive for different intestinal parasites with the most abundant parasite of Entameoba histolytica/dispar 68 (70.8%) followed by Giardia lamblia 18 (18.8%), Taenia species 5 (5.2%), Ascaris lumbricoides 2 (2.1%), hookworm 2 (2.1%) and Trichuris trichiura 1 (1.1%). Stool cultures revealed 3.5% of Salmonella isolates (Sero-grouping on Salmonella isolate was not done), while Shigella species was not isolated from any of the stool samples obtained from Food handlers. All isolates of Salmonella were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, amikacin and gentamicin but resistant to ampicillin, clindamycin, and erythromycin.
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a high prevalence of intestinal parasite in asymptomatic (apparently health) food handlers. Such infected food handlers can contaminate food, drinks and could serve as source of infection to consumers via food chain.","['Aklilu A', 'Kahase D', 'Dessalegn M', 'Tarekegn N', 'Gebremichael S', 'Zenebe S', 'Desta K', 'Mulugeta G', 'Mamuye Y', 'Mama M']",2015,8,,BMC Res Notes,"Aklilu A, et al.

25612741,In vivo production of a novel glycoconjugate vaccine against Shigella flexneri 2a in recombinant Escherichia coli: identification of stimulating factors for in vivo glycosylation.,"BACKGROUND: Glycoconjugated vaccines composed of polysaccharide antigens covalently linked to immunogenic carrier proteins have proved to belong to the most effective and safest vaccines for combating bacterial pathogens. The functional transfer of the N-glycosylation machinery from Campylobacter jejuni to the standard prokaryotic host Escherichia coli established a novel bioconjugation methodology termed bacterial glycoengineering.
RESULTS: In this study, we report on the production of a new recombinant glycoconjugate vaccine against Shigella flexneri 2a representing the major serotype for global outbreaks of shigellosis. We demonstrate that S. flexneri 2a O-polysaccharides can be transferred to a detoxified variant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa carrier protein exotoxin A (EPA) by the C. jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase PglB, resulting in glycosylated EPA-2a. Moreover, we optimized the in vivo production of this novel vaccine by identification and quantitative analysis of critical process parameters for glycoprotein synthesis. It was found that sequential induction of oligosaccharyltransferase PglB and carrier protein EPA increased the specific productivity of EPA-2a by a factor of 1.6. Furthermore, by the addition of 10 g/L of the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine during induction, glycoconjugate vaccine yield was boosted up to 3.1-fold. The optimum concentration of Mg2+ ions for N-glycan transfer was determined to be 10 mM. Finally, optimized parameters were transferred to high cell density cultures with a 46-fold increase of overall yield of glycoconjugate compared to the one in initial shake flask production.
CONCLUSION: The present study is the first attempt to identify stimulating parameters for improved productivity of S. flexneri 2a bioconjugates. Optimization of glycosylation efficiency will ultimately foster the transfer of lab-scale expression to a cost-effective in vivo production process for a glycoconjugate vaccine against S. flexneri 2a in E. coli. This study is an important step towards this goal and provides a starting point for further optimization studies.","['Kämpf MM', 'Braun M', 'Sirena D', 'Ihssen J', 'Thöny-Meyer L', 'Ren Q']",2015,14,,Microb Cell Fact,"Kämpf MM, et al.

Based on preliminary testing of stool specimens, Entamoeba histolytica infection was suspected as a possible cause. Shigella was also suspected in a subset of samples. On May 22, the American Samoa Department of Health requested assistance from CDC with the outbreak investigation. The goals of the investigation were to establish the presence of an outbreak, characterize its epidemiology and etiology, and recommend control measures. The CDC field team reviewed the emergency department log book for cases of diarrheal illness during April 15-June 13, 2014. During this period, 280 cases of diarrheal illness were recorded, with a peak occurring on May 10. Twice as many cases occurred during this period in 2014 compared with the same period in 2011, the most recent year for which comparable surveillance data were available. Cases were widely distributed across the island. The highest number of cases occurred in children aged 0-9 years. Across age groups, cases were similarly distributed among males and females. These patterns are not consistent with the epidemiology of disease caused by E. histolytica, which tends to cause more cases in males of all ages.","['Painter JE', 'Walker AT', 'Pytell J', 'Nua MT', 'Soliai-Lemusu S', 'Mintz E', 'Ali I', 'Parsons M', 'Martin H', 'Beach M', 'Bowen A', 'Cope J', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']",2015,64,1,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Painter JE, et al.

25588655,Defining the phylogenomics of Shigella species: a pathway to diagnostics.,"Shigellae cause significant diarrheal disease and mortality in humans, as there are approximately 163 million episodes of shigellosis and 1.1 million deaths annually. While significant strides have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, few studies on the genomic content of the Shigella species have been completed. The goal of this study was to characterize the genomic diversity of Shigella species through sequencing of 55 isolates representing members of each of the four Shigella species: S. flexneri, S. sonnei, S. boydii, and S. dysenteriae. Phylogeny inferred from 336 available Shigella and Escherichia coli genomes defined exclusive clades of Shigella; conserved genomic markers that can identify each clade were then identified. PCR assays were developed for each clade-specific marker, which was combined with an amplicon for the conserved Shigella invasion antigen, IpaH3, into a multiplex PCR assay. This assay demonstrated high specificity, correctly identifying 218 of 221 presumptive Shigella isolates, and sensitivity, by not identifying any of 151 diverse E. coli isolates incorrectly as Shigella. This new phylogenomics-based PCR assay represents a valuable tool for rapid typing of uncharacterized Shigella isolates and provides a framework that can be utilized for the identification of novel genomic markers from genomic data.","['Sahl JW', 'Morris CR', 'Emberger J', 'Fraser CM', 'Ochieng JB', 'Juma J', 'Fields B', 'Breiman RF', 'Gilmour M', 'Nataro JP', 'Rasko DA']",2015,53,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Sahl JW, et al.

This study retrospectively analysed 1577 pathogens isolated from inpatients and outpatients in six hospitals located in Northern (Inner Mongolia), Northeastern (Hebei), Eastern (Shanghai and Jiangsu), Southern (Hainan) and Central (Hubei) China between 2008 and 2013. Of the 1577 enteric pathogens, Salmonella presented with the highest frequency (36·0%), followed by diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (23·7%), Staphylococcus aureus (15·0%), Shigella (13·1%), and Aeromonas (4·6%). The predominant pathogens varied in different regions of China, with Salmonella most prevalent in Shanghai and Hainan, diarrhoeagenic E. coli most prevalent in Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu and Hubei, and Shigella most prevalent in Hebei. Enteric pathogens were more frequently isolated in males (56·9%) than in females (43·1%). The highest proportion of all enteric pathogens was found in infants (67·6%) with a peak in summer and autumn (68·5%). Antimicrobial susceptibility assay demonstrated that Shigella was more resistant to ampicillin, ceftriaxone and sulfamethoxazole than Salmonella. Of the top two serotypes in Salmonella, Typhimurium was more resistant to ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol than Enteritidis (P < 0·001). Meanwhile, the resistance rates of Shigella flexneri against ampicillin/sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol were significantly higher than those of Shigella sonnei (P < 0·001).

25567514,Recombinant outer membrane protein A induces a protective immune response against Escherichia coli infection in mice.,"Pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an important infectious Gram-negative bacterium causing millions of death every year. Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) has been suggested as a potential vaccine candidate for conferring protection against bacterial infection. In this study, a universal vaccine candidate for E. coli infection was developed and evaluated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the OmpA protein from E. coli shares 96~100%, 90~94%, and 45% identity with Shigella, Salmonella, and Pseudomonas strains, respectively. The ompA gene was cloned from the genomic DNA of E. coli, and then the OmpA protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) using the auto-induction method. The recombinant OmpA (rOmpA) protein had an average molecular weight of 36 kDa with the purity of 93.5%. Immunological analysis indicated that the titers of anti-rOmpA sera against rOmpA and whole cells were 1:642,000 and 1:140,000, respectively. Moreover, rOmpA not only conferred a high level of immunogenicity to protect mice against the challenge of E. coli, but also generated cross-protection against Shigella and Salmonella. The anti-rOmpA sera could enhance the phagocytic activity of neutrophils against E. coli. The survive ratios of mice immunized with rOmpA and PBS were 50% and 20% after 48 h post-challenge, indicating mice were protected from E. coli infection after immunization with rOmpA. All these results clearly indicate that rOmpA may be a promising candidate for the development of a subunit vaccine to prevent E. coli infection.","['Guan Q', 'Wang X', 'Wang X', 'Teng D', 'Mao R', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J']",2015,99,13,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,"Guan Q, et al.

We argue that in most cases there is no need for faeces testing. Clusters of shigelloses have become rare, and hygienic measures are sufficient to prevent transmission. The statistical significance of shigella transmission in children under 6 years old, on which the revised guideline is based, has no clinical relevance. In fact, the infection rate is only 7% even among the high-risk contacts of the index patients under 6 years old and only 1 infection per 4 index persons (25/104). Hygienic measures and exclusion from childcare centres or school in the event of symptoms are sufficient measures to prevent transmission.","['Niessen W', 'Ott A']",2015,159,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Niessen W and Ott A.

Bacteriophages are considered very safe and effective agents for controlling bacterial infections and contaminations. In this study, we describe the isolation and characterization of bacteriophage WZ1, isolated from waste water which inhibits the growth of S. dysenteriae. Phage WZ1 showed maximum stability at 37 °C and was stable up to 65 °C but was totally inactive at 70 °C. The pH stability increased from low to high and was totally inactive at pH 3 while maximum stability was observed at optimal pH 7. Phage WZ1 adsorption rate to the host bacterium was significantly enhanced by the addition of CaCl2 . It has a latent time and burst time of 24 min and about 430 virions/cell, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy of phage WZ1 revealed a head width of 10 ± 0.5 nm and length of 10 ± 0.2 nm with a contractile tail of 128 ± 25 nm long and 21 ± 0.5 nm wide and belongs to family Myoviridae of order Caudovirales. Twelve structural proteins ranging from 22 to 150 kDa were detected by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The genome was found to be double stranded DNA with an approximate size of 38 kb. It has a very good reduction potential for S. dysenteriae by lowering abruptly the optical density of the planktonic S. dysenteriae culture. Phage WZ1 is a very promising candidate for phage therapy and other applications such as phage typing.","['Jamal M', 'Chaudhry WN', 'Hussain T', 'Das CR', 'Andleeb S']",2015,55,4,J Basic Microbiol,"Jamal M, et al.

In Asia-Africa, the prevalence of resistance of total and different subtypes to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ceftazidime increased markedly, with a total prevalence of resistance up to 14·2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3·9-29·4], 22·6% (95% CI 4·8-48·6) and 6·2% (95% CI 3·8-9·1) during 2010-2012, respectively. By contrast, resistance rates to these TGCs in Europe-America remained relatively low--less than 1·0% during the 15 years. A noticeable finding was that certain countries both in Europe-America and Asia-Africa, had a rapid rising trend in the prevalence of resistance of S. sonnei, which even outnumbered S. flexneri in some periods. Moreover, comparison between countries showed that currently the most serious problem concerning resistance to these TGCs appeared in Vietnam, especially for ceftriaxone, China, especially for cefotaxime and Iran, especially for ceftazidime. These data suggest that monitoring of the drug resistance of Shigella strains should be strengthened and that rational use of antibiotics is required.","['Gu B', 'Zhou M', 'Ke X', 'Pan S', 'Cao Y', 'Huang Y', 'Zhuang L', 'Liu G', 'Tong M']",2015,143,13,Epidemiol Infect,"Gu B, et al.

25514820,A cohort study to define the age-specific incidence and risk factors of Shigella diarrhoeal infections in Vietnamese children: a study protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella spp. are one of the most common causes of paediatric dysentery globally, responsible for a substantial proportion of diarrhoeal disease morbidity and mortality, particularly in industrialising regions. Alarming levels of antimicrobial resistance are now reported in S. flexneri and S. sonnei, hampering treatment options. Little is known, however, about the burden of infection and disease due to Shigella spp. in the community.
METHODS/DESIGN: In order to estimate the incidence of this bacterial infection in the community in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam we have designed a longitudinal cohort to follow up approximately 700 children aged 12-60 months for two years with active and passive surveillance for diarrhoeal disease. Children will be seen at 6 month intervals for health checks where blood and stool samples will be collected. Families will also be contacted every two weeks for information on presence of diarrhoea in the child. Upon report of a diarrhoeal disease episode, study nurses will either travel to the family home to perform an evaluation or the family will attend a study hospital at a reduced cost, where a stool sample will also be collected. Case report forms collected at this time will detail information regarding disease history, risk factors and presence of disease in the household.Outcomes will include (i) age-specific incidence of Shigella spp. and other agents of diarrhoeal disease in the community, (ii) risk factors for identified aetiologies, (iii) rates of seroconversion to a host of gastrointestinal pathogens in the first few years of life. Further work regarding the longitudinal immune response to a variety of Shigella antigens, host genetics and candidate vaccine/diagnostic proteins will also be conducted.
DISCUSSION: This is the largest longitudinal cohort with active surveillance designed specifically to investigate Shigella infection and disease. The study is strengthened by the active surveillance component, which will likely capture a substantial proportion of episodes not normally identified through passive or hospital-based surveillance. It is hoped that information from this study will aid in the design and implementation of Shigella vaccine trials in the future.","['Thompson CN', 'Anders KL', 'Nhi le TQ', 'Tuyen HT', 'Van Minh P', 'Tu le TP', 'Nhu Tdo H', 'Nhan NT', 'Ly TT', 'Duong VT', 'Vi LL', 'Van Thuy NT', 'Hieu NT', 'Van Chau NV', 'Campbell JI', 'Thwaites G', 'Simmons C', 'Baker S']",2014,14,,BMC Public Health,"Thompson CN, et al.

METHODOLOGY: Fifty non-repeat clinical strains of S. sonnei isolated from stools of patients in different hospitals in Nanjing, China, were studied. Three subtyping tools, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA), were used for routinely subtyping local S. sonnei.
RESULTS: DNA sequencing only identified two sequence types (STs) among the 50 isolates in the MLST profiles, whereas PFGE and MLVA both showed suitable discriminatory power and yielded 19 and 30 different patterns, respectively. The major PFGE pattern comprised 21 strains isolated from different years. A total of four complexes were identified by MLVA, with the isolates differing by a single locus (single-locus variants).
CONCLUSIONS: The S. sonnei strains circulating in Nanjing, China, in 2007-2011 originated from different clones with a degree of diversity. Most of the clones were closely related to each other. Overall, the strains were distinguishable by PFGE and MLVA. MLVA based on eight selected VNTR loci represented a more favorable degree of discrimination than did PFGE and may be a reliable complement for PFGE for routine subtyping of S. sonnei.

25495749,Changing patterns of drug-resistant Shigella isolates in egypt.,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) is a serious problem in treating shigellosis. There are limited existing data examining the change in the antimicrobial resistance profile of Shigella in Egypt. We previously reported that 58% of the Shigella isolates in Egypt were resistant to at least one member of the three different antimicrobial groups. This study was performed to determine the antimicrobial resistance profile of Shigella, determine their possible mechanisms of resistance, and compare their resistance profile to those reported 20 years ago.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 500 subjects and processed for the isolation and identification of Shigella. The susceptibility of the isolates to 11 different antimicrobials was determined using the disc diffusion method.
RESULTS: Of 500 stool cultures, 24 (4.8%) samples were positive for Shigella. There was a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin (88%), tetracycline (83%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (75%). Also, there was a moderate percentage of resistance to chloramphenicol (46%), streptomycin (42%), ceftazidime (33%), and cefotaxime (25%). A lower percentage of resistance was recorded for amikacin, nalidixic acid (17% each), and ofloxacin (7%), while no resistance was found to ciprofloxacin (0%). Twenty-one of the isolates (88%) were resistant to at least three different antimicrobial groups (indicating MDR). The average number of antimicrobial agents to which the Shigella isolates were resistant was 4.3±1.4, while it was 3.4±1.5 in the same locality in 1994.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that there is a marked increase in MDR and change in the resistance patterns of Shigella over the past 20 years.","['Abd-Elmeged GM', 'Khairy RM', 'Abo-Eloyoon SM', 'Abdelwahab SF']",2015,21,3,Microb Drug Resist,"Abd-Elmeged GM, et al.

METHODS: Shigellosis is a notifiable disease in Spain since 1988. Cases are analyzed in Barcelona residents included in the registry between 1988-2012. A descriptive analysis by sex, age, mode of transmission and Shigella species is presented. Trend analysis and time series were performed.
RESULTS: Of the 559 cases analyzed, 60.15% were males. A sustained increase was observed in the trend since 2008 in males (p<0,05), especially at the expense of males who had no history of food poisoning or travel to endemic areas. The increasing tendency was greater in males from 21 to 60 years, both for S. flexneri (since 2009), and for S. sonnei (since 2004). In 2012 it was noted that in the men with S. flexneri, the 63% were men who have sex with men.
CONCLUSIONS: An increased trend was detected in men who had no history of food poisoning or travel to endemic areas. This increase points to a change in the pattern of shigellosis, becoming predominantly male and its main mechanism probably by sexual transmission.","['Culqui DR', 'García-de-Olalla-Rizo P', 'Alva-Chavez KP', 'Lafuente S', 'Rius C', 'de Simón M', 'Sabater S', 'Caylá JA']",2015,33,6,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,"Culqui DR, et al.

25485847,Molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant Shigella spp. of food origin.,"Shigella spp. are the causative agents of food-borne shigellosis, an acute enteric infection. The emergence of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Shigella presents an increasing challenge for clinicians in the treatment of shigellosis. Several studies worldwide have characterized the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance in clinical Shigella isolates of human origin, however, to date, no such characterization has been reported for Shigella spp. of food origin. In this study, we characterized the genetic basis of multidrug resistance in Shigella spp. isolated from 1600 food samples (800 meat products and 800 dairy products) collected from different street venders, butchers, retail markets, and slaughterhouses in Egypt. Twenty-four out of 27 Shigella isolates (88.9%) showed multidrug resistance phenotypes to at least three classes of antimicrobials. The multidrug-resistant Shigella spp. were as follows: Shigella flexneri (66.7%), Shigella sonnei (18.5%), and Shigella dysenteriae (3.7%). The highest resistance was to streptomycin (100.0%), then to kanamycin (95.8%), nalidixic acid (95.8%), tetracycline (95.8%), spectinomycin (93.6%), ampicillin (87.5%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (87.5%). PCR and DNA sequencing were used to screen and characterize integrons and antibiotic resistance genes. Our results indicated that 11.1% and 74.1% of isolates were positive for class 1 and class 2 integrons, respectively. Beta-lactamase-encoding genes were identified in 77.8% of isolates, and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were identified in 44.4% of isolates. These data provide useful information to better understand the molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance in Shigella spp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the molecular characterization of antibiotic resistance in Shigella spp. isolated from food.","['Ahmed AM', 'Shimamoto T']",2015,194,,Int J Food Microbiol,Ahmed AM and Shimamoto T.

25482842,An assessment of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Shigella vaccine candidates for infants and children.,"Despite improvements to water quality, sanitation, and the implementation of current prevention and treatment interventions, diarrhea remains a major cause of illness and death, especially among children less than five years of age in the developing world. Rotavirus vaccines have already begun making a real impact on diarrhea, but several more enteric vaccines will be necessary to achieve broader reductions of illness and death. Among the many causes of diarrheal disease, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Shigella are the two most important bacterial pathogens for which there are no currently licensed vaccines. Vaccines against these two pathogens could greatly reduce the impact of disease caused by these infections. This review describes the approaches to ETEC and Shigella vaccines that are currently under development, including a range of both cellular and subunit approaches for each pathogen. In addition, the review discusses strategies for maximizing the potential benefit of these vaccines, which includes the feasibility of co-administration, consolidation, and combination of vaccine candidates, as well as issues related to effective administration of enteric vaccines to infants. Recent impact studies indicate that ETEC and Shigella vaccines could significantly benefit global public health. Either vaccine, particularly if they could be combined together or with another enteric vaccine, would be an extremely valuable tool for saving lives and promoting the health of infants and children in the developing world, as well as potentially providing protection to travelers and military personnel visiting endemic areas.",['Walker RI'],2015,33,8,Vaccine,Walker RI.

25461693,Possible transfer of plasmid mediated third generation cephalosporin resistance between Escherichia coli and Shigella sonnei in the human gut.,"Choice of antibiotic for treatment of serious bacterial infection is rapidly diminishing by plasmid mediated transfer of antibiotic resistance. Here, we report a possible horizontal transfer of plasmid carrying third-generation-cephalosporin (TGC) resistance between Escherichia coli and Shigella sonnei. Two different types of colonies were identified in MacConkey agar plate from a faecal specimen collected from a patient with shigellosis. The colonies were identified as E. coli and S. sonnei. Both of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, erythromycin, azithromycin, nalidixic acid, ceftriaxone, cefixime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and susceptible to co-amoxiclave, amikacin, imipenam, astreonam, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, mecillinam. These two strains were positive for extended spectrum β-lactamase. We were able to transfer ESBL producing property from both ceftriaxone-resistant isolates to the ceftriaxone susceptible recipient E. coli K12 and S. sonnei. Plasmid profile analysis revealed that the first-generation E. coli K12 and S. sonnei transconjugants harbored a 50MDa R plasmid, as two-parent ESBL-producing S. sonnei and E. coli strains. Similar patterns of ESBL producing plasmid and transferable antimicrobial phenotype suggests that the ESBL producing plasmid might transferred between E. coli and S. sonnei through conjugation in the human gut.","['Rashid H', 'Rahman M']",2015,30,,Infect Genet Evol,Rashid H and Rahman M.

25446906,Complete nucleotide sequence of the IncI1 plasmid pSH4469 encoding CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum β-lactamase in a clinical isolate of Shigella sonnei from an outbreak in the Republic of Korea.,"An outbreak of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Shigella sonnei infections occurred in a school for disabled children in Gyeongbuk Province, Republic of Korea, in 2008. Five students were affected. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that all of the ESBL-producing S. sonnei isolates belonged to the same clone, and nucleotide sequence analysis of ESBL genes revealed that they harboured bla(CTX-M-15). This is the first identification of bla(CTX-M-15) in Shigella spp. in South Korea. In this study, a plasmid carrying the bla(CTX-M-15) gene, designated pSH4469, recovered from a S. sonnei isolate responsible for the outbreak was characterised. Replicon typing and plasmid multilocus sequence typing (pMLST) analysis of plasmids in the outbreak strain identified that the bla(CTX-M-15) gene was located on an IncI1 incompatibility group plasmid of sequence type 16 (ST16). The complete nucleotide sequence of pSH4469 revealed that this plasmid is 91109bp and harbours 119 putative genes, including another antibiotic resistance gene (bla(TEM-1b)) that is often associated with the ISEcp1-bla(CTX-M-15)-orf477delta transposable unit. The plasmid consists of a large backbone with considerable homology to the pEK204 plasmid isolated from Escherichia coli in the UK, except for insertion of an IS66 element found in pEK204.

25445584,Comparative proteomic analysis of outer membrane vesicles from Shigella flexneri under different culture conditions.,"The production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) is a common and regulated process of gram-negative bacteria. Nonetheless, the processes of Shigella flexneri OMV production still remain unclear. S. flexneri is the causative agent of endemic shigellosis in developing countries. The Congo red binding of strains is associated with increased infectivity of S. flexneri. Therefore, understanding the modulation pattern of OMV protein expression induced by Congo red will help to elucidate the bacterial pathogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the proteomic composition of OMVs and the change in OMV protein expression induced by Congo red using mTRAQ-based quantitative comparative proteomics. mTRAQ labelling increased the confidence in protein identification, and 148 total proteins were identified in S. flexneri-derived OMVs. These include a variety of important virulence factors, including Ipa proteins, TolC family, murein hydrolases, and members of the serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATEs) family. Among the identified proteins, 28 and five proteins are significantly up- and down-regulated in the Congo red-induced OMV, respectively. Additionally, by comprehensive comparison with previous studies focused on DH5a-derived OMV, we identified some key node proteins in the protein-protein interaction network that may be involved in OMV biogenesis and are common to all gram-negative bacteria.","['Chen Y', 'Liu L', 'Fu H', 'Wei C', 'Jin Q']",2014,453,4,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Chen Y, et al.

25416186,Molecular characterization of Shigella spp. from patients in Gabon 2011-2013.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella spp. dysentery is widespread in developing countries; the incidence is particularly high in children between 1-2 years of age. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is a paucity of epidemiological data on Shigella spp., with possible negative consequences for recognition and correct treatment choice for this life-threatening bacterial infection. We therefore characterized Shigella spp. isolates from Gabon.
METHODS: The antimicrobial resistance, virulence factors, genotypes and mobile genetic elements of Shigella isolates (29 S. flexneri; 5 S. boydii; 3 S. sonnei) from a retrospective strain collection were analyzed.
RESULTS: High resistance rates were found for gentamicin and tetracycline (100%, 37/37), cotrimoxazole (92%, 34/37) and ampicillin (84%, 31/37). All isolate harbored ial and ipaH; no isolate produced Shiga toxins (stx1/2); enterotoxins (set1A/B) were only found in S. flexneri (n=19). Multilocus sequence types (MLST) clustered with global clones. A high prevalence of atypical class 1 integrons harboring blaOXA30 and aadA1 were detected in S. flexneri, while all S. sonnei carried class 2 integrons.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong link of Gabonese Shigella spp. isolates with pandemic lineages as they cluster with major global clones and frequently carry atypical class 1 integrons which are frequently reported in Shigella spp. from Asia.","['Schaumburg F', 'Alabi AS', 'Kaba H', 'Lell B', 'Becker K', 'Grobusch MP', 'Kremsner PG', 'Mellmann A']",2015,109,4,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Schaumburg F, et al.

25405985,"The Shigella flexneri type 3 secretion system is required for tyrosine kinase-dependent protrusion resolution, and vacuole escape during bacterial dissemination.","Shigella flexneri is a human pathogen that triggers its own entry into intestinal cells and escapes primary vacuoles to gain access to the cytosolic compartment. As cytosolic and motile bacteria encounter the cell cortex, they spread from cell to cell through formation of membrane protrusions that resolve into secondary vacuoles in adjacent cells. Here, we examined the roles of the Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) in S. flexneri dissemination in HT-29 intestinal cells infected with the serotype 2a strain 2457T. We generated a 2457T strain defective in the expression of MxiG, a central component of the T3SS needle apparatus. As expected, the ΔmxiG strain was severely affected in its ability to invade HT-29 cells, and expression of mxiG under the control of an arabinose inducible expression system (ΔmxiG/pmxiG) restored full infectivity. In this experimental system, removal of the inducer after the invasion steps (ΔmxiG/pmxiG (Ara withdrawal)) led to normal actin-based motility in the cytosol of HT-29 cells. However, the time spent in protrusions until vacuole formation was significantly increased. Moreover, the number of formed protrusions that failed to resolve into vacuoles was also increased. Accordingly, the ΔmxiG/pmxiG (Ara withdrawal) strain failed to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation in membrane protrusions, a signaling event that is required for the resolution of protrusions into vacuoles. Finally, the ΔmxiG/pmxiG (Ara withdrawal) strain failed to escape from the formed secondary vacuoles, as previously reported in non-intestinal cells. Thus, the T3SS system displays multiple roles in S. flexneri dissemination in intestinal cells, including the tyrosine kinase signaling-dependent resolution of membrane protrusions into secondary vacuoles, and the escape from the formed secondary vacuoles.","['Kuehl CJ', 'Dragoi AM', 'Agaisse H']",2014,9,11,PLoS One,"Kuehl CJ, et al.

25399653,Treatment of drug-resistant Shigella infections.,"Since the introduction of sulfonamides in the late 1930s, selective pressure and the widespread dissemination of mobile genetic elements conferring antimicrobial resistance have forced clinicians to seek successive agents for the treatment of multidrug-resistant shigellosis. Over the decades, the principal antibiotics used to treat Shigella infections have included tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nalidixic acid. Presently, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone serve as the mainstays of treatment, although growing evidence has documented decreased susceptibility or full resistance to these agents in some regions. With diminishing pharmaceutical options available, there is an enhanced need for preventive measures in the form of improved sanitation and hygiene standards, strict use of currently effective agents, and a safe and effective licensed vaccine.","['Klontz KC', 'Singh N']",2015,13,1,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,Klontz KC and Singh N.

RECENT FINDINGS: Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei have been identified as the main serogroups circulating in developing and developed countries, respectively. However, a shift in the dominant species from S. flexneri to S. sonnei has been observed in countries that have experienced recent improvements in socioeconomic conditions. Despite the increasing usage of molecular methods in the diagnosis and virulence characterization of Shigella strains, researchers have been unsuccessful in finding a specific target gene for this bacillus. New research has demonstrated the role of proteins whose expressions are temperature-regulated, as well as genes involved in the processes of adhesion, invasion, dissemination, and inflammation, aiding in the clarification of the complex pathobiology of shigellosis.
SUMMARY: Knowledge about the epidemiologic profile of circulating serogroups of Shigella and an understanding of its pathobiology as well as of the virulence genes is important for the development of preventive measures and interventions to reduce the worldwide spread of shigellosis.","['Lima IF', 'Havt A', 'Lima AA']",2015,31,1,Curr Opin Gastroenterol,"Lima IF, et al.

25378474,A Shigella flexneri virulence plasmid encoded factor controls production of outer membrane vesicles.,"Shigella spp. use a repertoire of virulence plasmid-encoded factors to cause shigellosis. These include components of a Type III Secretion Apparatus (T3SA) that is required for invasion of epithelial cells and many genes of unknown function. We constructed an array of 99 deletion mutants comprising all genes encoded by the virulence plasmid (excluding those known to be required for plasmid maintenance) of Shigella flexneri. We screened these mutants for their ability to bind the dye Congo red: an indicator of T3SA function. This screen focused our attention on an operon encoding genes that modify the cell envelope including virK, a gene of partially characterized function. We discovered that virK is required for controlled release of proteins to the culture supernatant. Mutations in virK result in a temperature-dependent overproduction of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The periplasmic chaperone/protease DegP, a known regulator of OMV production in Escherichia coli (encoded by a chromosomal gene), was found to similarly control OMV production in S. flexneri. Both virK and degP show genetic interactions with mxiD, a structural component of the T3SA. Our results are consistent with a model in which VirK and DegP relieve the periplasmic stress that accompanies assembly of the T3SA.","['Sidik S', 'Kottwitz H', 'Benjamin J', 'Ryu J', 'Jarrar A', 'Garduno R', 'Rohde JR']",2014,4,12,G3 (Bethesda),"Sidik S, et al.

25376469,Shiga toxin induces membrane reorganization and formation of long range lipid order.,"Lateral variation of the in-plane orientation of lipids in a bilayer is referred to as texture. The influence of the protein Shiga toxin on orientational membrane texture was studied in phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers using polarization two-photon fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy. A content of 1% of glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor lipids in a bilayer was used to bind the Shiga toxin B-subunit to the surface of gel domains. Binding of the Shiga toxin B-subunit to lipids led to the modulation of orientational membrane texture in gel domains and induced membrane reordering. When Shiga toxin was added above the lipid chain melting temperature, the toxin interaction with the membrane induced rearrangement and clustering of Gb3 lipids that resulted in the long range order and alignment of lipids in gel domains. The toxin induced redistribution of Gb3 lipids inside gel domains is governed by the temperature at which Shiga toxin was added to the membrane: above or below the phase transition. The temperature is thus one of the critical factors controlling lipid organization and texture in the presence of Shiga toxin. Lipid chain ordering imposed by Shiga toxin binding can be another factor driving the reconstruction of lipid organization and crystallization of lipids inside gel domains.","['Solovyeva V', 'Johannes L', 'Simonsen AC']",2015,11,1,Soft Matter,"Solovyeva V, et al.

25368115,"Impact of detergent on biophysical properties and immune response of the IpaDB fusion protein, a candidate subunit vaccine against Shigella species.","Shigella spp. are causative agents of bacillary dysentery, a human illness with high global morbidity levels, particularly among elderly and infant populations. Shigella infects via the fecal-oral route, and its virulence is dependent upon a type III secretion system (T3SS). Two components of the exposed needle tip complex of the Shigella T3SS, invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) and IpaB, have been identified as broadly protective antigens in the mouse lethal pneumonia model. A recombinant fusion protein (DB fusion) was created by joining the coding sequences of IpaD and IpaB. The DB fusion is coexpressed with IpaB's cognate chaperone, IpgC, for proper recombinant expression. The chaperone can then be removed by using the mild detergents octyl oligooxyethelene (OPOE) or N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (LDAO). The DB fusion in OPOE or LDAO was used for biophysical characterization and subsequent construction of an empirical phase diagram (EPD). The EPD showed that the DB fusion in OPOE is most stable at neutral pH below 55 °C. In contrast, the DB fusion in LDAO exhibited remarkable thermal plasticity, since this detergent prevents the loss of secondary and tertiary structures after thermal unfolding at 90 °C, as well as preventing thermally induced aggregation. Moreover, the DB fusion in LDAO induced higher interleukin-17 secretion and provided a higher protective efficacy in a mouse challenge model than did the DB fusion in OPOE. These data indicate that LDAO might introduce plasticity to the protein, promoting thermal resilience and enhanced protective efficacy, which may be important in its use as a subunit vaccine.","['Chen X', 'Choudhari SP', 'Martinez-Becerra FJ', 'Kim JH', 'Dickenson NE', 'Toth RT', 'Joshi SB', 'Greenwood JC', 'Clements JD', 'Picking WD', 'Middaugh CR', 'Picking WL']",2015,83,1,Infect Immun,"Chen X, et al.

25365201,Shigella dysenteriae modulates BMP pathway to induce mucin gene expression in vivo and in vitro.,"Mucosal epithelial cells in the intestine act as the first line of host defense against pathogens by increasing mucin production for clearance. Despite this fact, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which Shigella dysenteriae transduce mucin gene expression remain poorly defined. The goal of this study was to determine the role of Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway in mucin gene expression during S. dysenteriae infection. In this study we demonstrate that S. dysenteriae activates BMP signaling to induce MUC2 and MUC5AC gene expression in rat ileal loop model and in vitro. We also observed that BMP pathway regulates CDX2 expression which plays a critical role in induction of MUC2 gene during S. dysenteriae infection. In SMAD4 silenced cells S. dysenteriae infection did not abrogate MUC2 and MUC5AC gene expression whereas in CDX2 silenced cells it induces differential expression of MUC5AC gene. These results suggest that SMAD4-CDX2 induces MUC2 gene expression whereas SMAD4 directly influences differential expression of MUC5AC gene. Altogether, our results show that during S. dysenteriae infection the BMP pathway modulates inflammatory transcription factors CDX2 and SMAD4 to induce MUC2 and MUC5AC gene expression which plays a key role in the regulation of host mucosal defense thereby paving a cue for therapeutic application.","['Gopal A', 'Iyer SC', 'Gopal U', 'Devaraj N', 'Halagowder D']",2014,9,11,PLoS One,"Gopal A, et al.

25361185,"Effects of Shigella-, Campylobacter- and ETEC-associated diarrhea on childhood growth.","BACKGROUND: Studies examining the etiology-specific effects of diarrheal disease on growth are limited and variable in their analytic methods, making comparisons difficult and priority setting based on these findings challenging. A study by Black et al (Black RE, Brown KH, Becker S. Effects of diarrhea associated with specific enteropathogens on the growth of children in rural Bangladesh. Pediatrics. 1984;33:1004-1009.) examined the association between Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-related disease and weight gain and linear growth in Bangladeshi children aged 0-5 years. We estimated similar associations in a 2002 cohort of 0- to 6-year-old children in the Peruvian Amazon.
METHODS: Diarrheal surveillence was conducted using household visits 3 times per week. Anthropometry was collected monthly. Mixed-effect models were used to estimate the association between Shigella, ETEC and Campylobacter diarrhea and weight gain in a 2-month period and linear growth over a 9-month period. Diarrheal disease burdens and growth intervals were quantified so as to be as comparable as possible to the original report.
RESULTS: Shigella- and ETEC-associated diarrhea were not associated with diminished weight gain, although the association between ETEC diarrhea and weight gain (-4.5 g/percent of days spent with ETEC, P = 0.098) was twice that of other etiologic agents, as well as similar in magnitude to the original report. Shigella-associated diarrhea was associated with decreased linear growth (0.055 cm less growth/percent days, P = 0.008), also similar to the original study.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that associations between enteropathogen-specific diarrheal episodes and growth, particularly Shigella, are comparable across geographic and epidemiological contexts.","['Lee G', 'Paredes Olortegui M', 'Peñataro Yori P', 'Black RE', 'Caulfield L', 'Banda Chavez C', 'Hall E', 'Pan WK', 'Meza R', 'Kosek M']",2014,33,10,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Lee G, et al.

25355173,The bacterial pathogen-ubiquitin interface: lessons learned from Shigella.,"Shigella species are the aetiological agents of shigellosis, a severe diarrhoeal disease that is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Shigellosis causes massive colonic destruction, high fever and bloody diarrhoea. Shigella pathogenesis is tightly linked to the ability of the bacterium to invade and replicate intracellularly within the colonic epithelium. Shigella uses a type 3 secretion system to deliver its effector proteins into the cytosol of infected cells. Among the repertoire of Shigella effectors, many are known to target components of the actin cytoskeleton to promote bacterial entry. An emerging alternate theme for effector function is the targeting of the host ubiquitin system. Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification restricted to eukaryotes and is involved in many essential host processes. By virtue of sheer number of ubiquitin-modulating effector proteins, it is clear that Shigella has invested heavily into subversion of the ubiquitin system. Understanding these host-pathogen interactions will inform us about the strategies used by successful pathogens and may also provide avenues for novel antimicrobial strategies.","['Tanner K', 'Brzovic P', 'Rohde JR']",2015,17,1,Cell Microbiol,"Tanner K, et al.

25327486,Genetic and structural identification of an O-acyltransferase gene (oacC) responsible for the 3/4-O-acetylation on rhamnose III in Shigella flexneri serotype 6.,"BACKGROUND: O-antigen (O-polysaccharide) of the lipopolysaccharide is a highly variable cell component of the outer membrane in Shigella flexneri. It defines the serospecificity and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of shigellosis. There are two distinct O-antigen forms for the 19 serotypes of S. flexneri: one for serotypes 1-5, X, Y, 7 (and their subtypes), and the other for serotype 6. Although having different basal O-polysaccharide structures, the two forms share a common disaccharide fragment [→2)-α-l-Rhap III-(1 → 2)-α-l-Rhap II]. In serotype 6 and some non-6 serotypes, RhaIII is O-acetylated at position either 3 or 4 (3/4-O-acetylation), conferring to the hosts a novel antigenic determinant named O-factor 9. An acyltransferase gene (oacB) responsible for this modification has been identified in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and Y, but not in serotype 6.
RESULTS: Using genetic, serological, and chemical approaches, another acyltransferase gene named oacC was demonstrated to be responsible for the 3/4-O-acetylation on RhaIII in the O-antigen of S. flexneri serotype 6. Inactivation of the oacC gene resulted in the loss of the 3/4-O-acetyltion, and the cloned oacC gene restored this modification upon transformation. In accordance with the similarity in the acceptor substrate structure and high sequence homology (72% identity) between oacC and oacB, oacC has the interchangeable function with the oacB gene in mediation of the 3/4-O-acetylation. The oacC gene is located in a prophage on the chromosome and presented in all 77 serotype 6 strains tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Identification and functional characterization of the O-acetyltransferase encoding gene, oacC, shows that it is involved in O-antigen modification by 3/4-O-acetylation on RhaIII specific to serotype 6.","['Knirel YA', 'Wang J', 'Luo X', 'Senchenkova SN', 'Lan R', 'Shpirt AM', 'Du P', 'Shashkov AS', 'Zhang N', 'Xu J', 'Sun Q']",2014,14,,BMC Microbiol,"Knirel YA, et al.

25308772,Bayesian spatio-temporal random coefficient time series (BaST-RCTS) model of infectious disease.,"This paper proposes a new method, using Bayesian approach, to analyze time series data of infectious diseases which have both temporal and spatial variational structures. Standard ways to model heteroscedastic time series are the ARCH-type models. However, from an empirical standpoint, there is a need to include spatial effect into time series analysis to make allowance for confounder and ecological biases. On the basis of random coefficient autoregressive model, our model takes account of spatial correlated/uncorrelated heterogeneity. To assure the applicability of our model, we set up hypothesis framework before analyzing. It was proved that our model could provide the first two conditional moments of ARCH-type models. The empirical study of bacillary dysentery data also illustrated that our model could make accurate and precise approximations.","['Zhang T', 'Zhang X', 'Ma Y', 'Zhou XA', 'Liu Y', 'Feng Z', 'Li X']",2014,258,,Math Biosci,"Zhang T, et al.

BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is caused by different species of Shigella and one of the most common causes of diarrhea in children. This disease is endemic in many developing countries including Iran.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cross sectional study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Abadan, Iran during June 2011 to May 2013. Stool specimens were collected from pediatric age group. All isolates were confirmed as Shigella species by biochemical and serologic tests. Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of these isolates was studied by disk diffusion Method.
RESULTS: Among all 705 stool samples, 36 (5.1%) yielded Shigella. Of cases, 392 (55.6%) were girl and 313 (44.4%) were boy. The most common Shigella isolates were S. flexneri (n=19, 52.7%) followed by S. sonnei (n=11, 30.5%), S. boydii (n=4, 11.1%) and S. dysenteriae 2(5.5%). Of the Shigella isolates, 47.2% showed resistance to two or more antimicrobial agents. Resistance pattern against various antimicrobials were as follows: trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (80.5%), ampicillin (63.8%), tetracycline (58.3%), chloramphenicol (33.3%), nalidixic acid (27.7%), and cefixime (16.6%). There was no resistance against ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
CONCLUSION: The most common isolates were S. flexneri followed by S. Sonnei. There was no antibiotic resistance against ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. TMP-SMZ showed highest resistance pattern.","['Jomezadeh N', 'Babamoradi S', 'Kalantar E', 'Javaherizadeh H']",2014,7,4,Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,"Jomezadeh N, et al.

25283727,"Characterization and complete genome sequence of a novel N4-like bacteriophage, pSb-1 infecting Shigella boydii.","Shigellosis is one of major foodborne pathogens in both developed and developing countries. Although antibiotic therapy is considered an effective treatment for shigellosis, the imprudent use of antibiotics has led to the increase of multiple-antibiotic-resistant Shigella species globally. In this study, we isolated a virulent Podoviridae bacteriophage (phage), pSb-1, that infects Shigella boydii. One-step growth analysis revealed that this phage has a short latent period (15 min) and a large burst size (152.63 PFU/cell), indicating that pSb-1 has good host infectivity and effective lytic activity. The double-stranded DNA genome of pSb-1 is composed of 71,629 bp with a G + C content of 42.74%. The genome encodes 103 putative ORFs, 9 putative promoters, 21 transcriptional terminators, and one tRNA region. Genome sequence analysis of pSb-1 and comparative analysis with the homologous phage EC1-UPM, N4-like phage revealed that there is a high degree of similarity (94%, nucleotide sequence identity) between pSb-1 and EC1-UPM in 73 of the 103 ORFs of pSb-1. The results of this investigation indicate that pSb-1 is a novel virulent N4-like phage infecting S. boydii and that this phage might have potential uses against shigellosis.","['Jun JW', 'Yun SK', 'Kim HJ', 'Chai JY', 'Park SC']",2014,165,8,Res Microbiol,"Jun JW, et al.

25271406,Clinical isolates of Shiga toxin 1a-producing Shigella flexneri with an epidemiological link to recent travel to Hispañiola.,"Shiga toxins (Stx) are cytotoxins involved in severe human intestinal disease. These toxins are commonly found in Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli; however, the toxin genes have been found in other Shigella species. We identified 26 Shigella flexneri serotype 2 strains isolated by public health laboratories in the United States during 2001-2013, which encode the Shiga toxin 1a gene (stx1a). These strains produced and released Stx1a as measured by cytotoxicity and neutralization assays using anti-Stx/Stx1a antiserum. The release of Stx1a into culture supernatants increased ≈100-fold after treatment with mitomycin C, suggesting that stx1a is carried by a bacteriophage. Infectious phage were found in culture supernatants and increased ≈1,000-fold with mitomycin C. Whole-genome sequencing of several isolates and PCR analyses of all strains confirmed that stx1a was carried by a lambdoid bacteriophage. Furthermore, all patients who reported foreign travel had recently been to Hispañiola, suggesting that emergence of these novel strains is associated with that region.","['Gray MD', 'Lampel KA', 'Strockbine NA', 'Fernandez RE', 'Melton-Celsa AR', 'Maurelli AT']",2014,20,10,Emerg Infect Dis,"Gray MD, et al.

25261061,"Molecular characterization of serologically atypical provisional serovars of Shigella isolates from Kolkata, India.","During 2000-2004, 13 Shigella strains that were untypable by commercially available antisera were isolated from children <5 years of age with acute diarrhoea in Kolkata. These strains were subsequently identified as Shigella dysenteriae provisional serovar 204/96 (n = 3), Shigella dysenteriae provisional serovar E23507 (n = 1), Shigella dysenteriae provisional serovar I9809-73 (n = 1), Shigella dysenteriae provisional serovar 93-119 (n = 1), Shigella flexneri provisional serovar 88-893 (n = 6) and Shigella boydii provisional serovar E16553 (n = 1). In this study, characterization of those provisional serovars of Shigella was performed with respect to their antimicrobial resistance, plasmids, virulence genes and PFGE profiles. The drug resistant strains (n = 10) of Shigella identified in this study possessed various antibiotic resistance genetic markers like catA (for chloramphenicol resistance); tetA and tetB (for tetracycline resistance); dfrA1 and sul2 (for co-trimoxazole resistance); aadA1, strA and strB (for streptomycin resistance) and blaOXA-1 (for ampicillin resistance). Class 1 and/or class 2 integrons were present in eight resistant strains. Three study strains were pan-susceptible. A single mutation in the gyrA gene (serine to leucine at codon 83) was present in four quinolone resistant strains. The virulence gene ipaH (invasion plasmid antigen H) was uniformly present in all strains in this study, but the stx (Shiga toxin) and set1 (Shigella enterotoxin 1) genes were absent. Other virulence genes like ial (invasion associated locus) and sen (Shigella enterotoxin 2) were occasionally present. A large plasmid of 212 kb and of incompatibility type IncFIIA was present in the majority of the strains (n = 10) and diversity was noticed in the smaller plasmid profiles of these strains even within the same provisional serovars.

25257255,Spatial-temporal pattern and risk factor analysis of bacillary dysentery in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan urban region of China.,"BACKGROUND: Bacillary dysentery remains a major public health concern in China. The Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan urban region is one of the most heavily infected areas in the country. This study aimed to analyze epidemiological features of bacillary dysentery, detect spatial-temporal clusters of the disease, and analyze risk factors that may affect bacillary dysentery incidence in the region.
METHODS: Bacillary dysentery case data from January 2011 to December 2011 in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan were used in this study. The epidemiological features of cases were characterized, then scan statistics were performed to detect spatial temporal clusters of bacillary dysentery. A spatial panel model was used to identify potential risk factors.
RESULTS: There were a total of 28,765 cases of bacillary dysentery in 2011. The results of the analysis indicated that compared with other age groups, the highest incidence (473.75/105) occurred in individuals <5 years of age. The incidence in males (530.57/105) was higher compared with females (409.06/105). On a temporal basis, incidence increased rapidly starting in April. Peak incidence occurred in August (571.10/105). Analysis of the spatial distribution model revealed that factors such as population density, temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours were positively associated with incidence rate. Per capita gross domestic product was negatively associated with disease incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Meteorological and socio-economic factors have affected the transmission of bacillary dysentery in the urban Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region of China.

25252629,Isolation and development of bioluminescent reporter phages for bacterial dysentery.,"Shigellosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, most notably amongst children. Moreover, there is a global increase in the occurrence of multidrug-resistant isolates, including the epidemic and pandemic Shigella dysenteriae type 1 strain. We developed a bioluminescent reporter phage assay to facilitate detection and simultaneously determine antibiotic susceptibility. A Shigella flexneri phage (Shfl25875) was isolated from environmental wastewater and characterized by DNA sequencing. Shfl25875 is T4-like, harbors a 169,062-bp genome, and grows on most (28/29) S. flexneri strains and all 12 S. dysenteriae type 1 strains tested. The genes encoding bacterial luciferase were integrated into the Shfl25875 genome to create a ""light-tagged"" phage capable of transducing a bioluminescent phenotype to infected cells. Shfl25875::luxAB rapidly detects cultured isolates with high sensitivity. Specificity experiments indicate that the reporter does not respond to Shigella boydii, non-type 1 S. dysenteriae strains, and most non-Shigella Enterobacteriaceae. Shfl25875::luxAB generates ampicillin and ciprofloxacin susceptibility profiles that are similar to the standard Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) growth microdilution method, but in a significantly shorter time. In addition, the reporter phage detects Shigella in mock-infected stool.

We tested 216 Shigella isolates collected in Shanghai in 2007 for the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBL-producing isolates were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping, conjugation, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and DNA sequence analysis of regions adjacent to bla genes. Plasmids containing genes encoding ESBLs were analyzed using plasmid replicon typing. ESBLs were produced by 18.1 % (39/216) of Shigella isolates, and all 39 ESBL-producing strains harbored bla CTX-M genes. CTX-M-14 was the most frequent variant (69.2 %, 27/39), followed by CTX-M-15 (15.4 %, 6/39). All bla CTX-M genes were transferable by conjugation, and the insertion sequence ISEcp1 was detected upstream of all bla CTX-M genes. The CTX-M-producing Shigella isolates showed high clonal diversity. IncI1, IncFII, IncN, and IncB/O replicons were respectively detected in 23 (58.9 %), 9 (23.1 %), 1 (2.6 %), and 1 (2.6 %) of the 39 transconjugants carrying bla CTX-M. The bla CTX-M-14 genes were most frequently carried by IncI1 (n = 13, 48.1 %) or IncFII (n = 9, 33.3 %) plasmids, and the bla CTX-M-15 genes were closely associated with IncI1 (n = 5, 83.3 %). Our findings demonstrate the high prevalence of ESBL-producing Shigella in Shanghai, the importance of plasmids and ISEcp1 as carriers of bla CTX-M genes, and the close association between certain bla CTX-M genes with a specific plasmid.","['Li J', 'Li B', 'Ni Y', 'Sun J']",2015,34,3,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Li J, et al.

25230163,Inflammation-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli are enriched in pathways for use of propanediol and iron and M-cell translocation.,"BACKGROUND: Perturbations of the intestinal microbiome, termed dysbiosis, are linked to intestinal inflammation. Isolation of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) from intestines of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), dogs with granulomatous colitis, and mice with acute ileitis suggests these bacteria share pathoadaptive virulence factors that promote inflammation.
METHODS: To identify genes associated with AIEC, we sequenced the genomes of phylogenetically diverse AIEC strains isolated from people with CD (4), dogs with granulomatous colitis (2), and mice with ileitis (2) and 1 non-AIEC strain from CD ileum and compared them with 38 genome sequences of E. coli and Shigella. We then determined the prevalence of AIEC-associated genes in 49 E. coli strains from patients with CD and controls and correlated genotype with invasion of intestinal epithelial cells, persistence within macrophages, AIEC pathotype, and growth in standardized conditions.
RESULTS: Genes encoding propanediol utilization (pdu operon) and iron acquisition (yersiniabactin, chu operon) were overrepresented in AIEC relative to nonpathogenic E. coli. PduC (propanediol dehydratase) was enriched in CD-derived AIEC, correlated with increased cellular invasion, and persistence in vitro and was increasingly expressed in fucose-containing media. Growth of AIEC required iron, and the presence of chuA (heme acquisition) correlated with persistence in macrophages. CD-associated AIEC with lpfA 154 (long polar fimbriae) demonstrated increased invasion of epithelial cells and translocation across M cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic basis of the AIEC pathotype, supporting the concept that AIEC are equipped to exploit and promote intestinal inflammation and reveal potential targets for intervention against AIEC and inflammation-associated dysbiosis.","['Dogan B', 'Suzuki H', 'Herlekar D', 'Sartor RB', 'Campbell BJ', 'Roberts CL', 'Stewart K', 'Scherl EJ', 'Araz Y', 'Bitar PP', 'Lefébure T', 'Chandler B', 'Schukken YH', 'Stanhope MJ', 'Simpson KW']",2014,20,11,Inflamm Bowel Dis,"Dogan B, et al.

25226510,Use of Shigella flexneri to study autophagy-cytoskeleton interactions.,"Shigella flexneri is an intracellular pathogen that can escape from phagosomes to reach the cytosol, and polymerize the host actin cytoskeleton to promote its motility and dissemination. New work has shown that proteins involved in actin-based motility are also linked to autophagy, an intracellular degradation process crucial for cell autonomous immunity. Strikingly, host cells may prevent actin-based motility of S. flexneri by compartmentalizing bacteria inside 'septin cages' and targeting them to autophagy. These observations indicate that a more complete understanding of septins, a family of filamentous GTP-binding proteins, will provide new insights into the process of autophagy. This report describes protocols to monitor autophagy-cytoskeleton interactions caused by S. flexneri in vitro using tissue culture cells and in vivo using zebrafish larvae.

Vibrio cholerae was the most commonly isolated pathogen (16%) of the four pathogens tested followed by rotavirus (5%), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (4%), and Shigella (4%). Of these pathogens, V. cholerae (19% vs. 11%, P < 0·001), ETEC (9% vs. 4%, P < 0·001), and rotavirus (5% vs. 3%, P = 0·013) were more commonly detected from patients presenting to urban hospitals than rural hospitals, but Shigella was more frequently isolated from patients presenting to rural hospitals than urban hospitals (7% vs. 2%, P < 0·001). The isolation rate of Shigella was higher in the elderly than in younger adults (8% vs. 3%, P < 0·001). Some or severe dehydration was higher in urban adults than rural adults (P < 0·001). Our findings indicate that despite economic and other progress made, conditions facilitating transmission of V. cholerae and Shigella prevail in adults with diarrhoea in Bangladesh and further efforts are needed to control these infections.","['Ferdous F', 'Ahmed S', 'Farzana FD', 'Das J', 'Malek MA', 'Das SK', 'Salam MA', 'Faruque AS']",2015,143,7,Epidemiol Infect,"Ferdous F, et al.

25216677,Shigella flexneri targets the HP1γ subcode through the phosphothreonine lyase OspF.,"HP1 proteins are transcriptional regulators that, like histones, are targets for post-translational modifications defining an HP1-mediated subcode. HP1γ has multiple phosphorylation sites, including serine 83 (S83) that marks it to sites of active transcription. In a guinea pig model for Shigella enterocolitis, we observed that the defective type III secretion mxiD Shigella flexneri strain caused more HP1γ phosphorylation in the colon than the wild-type strain. Shigella interferes with HP1 phosphorylation by injecting the phospholyase OspF. This effector interacts with HP1γ and alters its phosphorylation at S83 by inactivating ERK and consequently MSK1, a downstream kinase. MSK1 that here arises as a novel HP1γ kinase, phosphorylates HP1γ at S83 in the context of an MSK1-HP1γ complex, and thereby favors its accumulation on its target genes. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that this mechanism is linked to up-regulation of proliferative gene and fine-tuning of immune gene expression. Thus, in addition to histones, bacteria control host transcription by modulating the activity of HP1 proteins, with potential implications in transcriptional reprogramming at the mucosal barrier.","['Harouz H', 'Rachez C', 'Meijer BM', 'Marteyn B', 'Donnadieu F', 'Cammas F', 'Muchardt C', 'Sansonetti P', 'Arbibe L']",2014,33,22,EMBO J,"Harouz H, et al.

25199561,Detection and analysis of CRISPRs of Shigella.,"The recently discovered CRISPRs (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins are a novel genetic barrier that limits horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes and the CRISPR loci provide a historical view of the exposure of prokaryotes to a variety of foreign genetic elements. The aim of study was to investigate the occurrence and distribution of the CRISPRs in Shigella. A collection of 61 strains of Shigella were screened for the existence of CRISPRs. Three CRISPR loci were identified among 61 shigella strains. CRISPR1/cas loci are detected in 49 strains of shigella. Yet, IS elements were detected in cas gene in some strains. In the remaining 12 Shigella flexneri strains, the CRISPR1/cas locus is deleted and only a cas3' pseudo gene and a repeat sequence are present. The presence of CRISPR2 is frequently accompanied by the emergence of CRISPR1. CRISPR3 loci were present in almost all strains (52/61). The length of CRISPR arrays varied from 1 to 9 spacers. Sequence analysis of the CRISPR arrays revealed that few spacers had matches in the GenBank databases. However, one spacer in CRISPR3 loci matches the cognate cas3 genes and no cas gene was present around CRISPR3 region. Analysis of CRISPR sequences show that CRISPR have little change which makes CRISPR poor genotyping markers. The present study is the first attempt to determine and analyze CRISPRs of shigella isolated from clinical patients.","['Guo X', 'Wang Y', 'Duan G', 'Xue Z', 'Wang L', 'Wang P', 'Qiu S', 'Xi Y', 'Yang H']",2015,70,1,Curr Microbiol,"Guo X, et al.

25192335,Molecular and functional profiling of the polyamine content in enteroinvasive E. coli : looking into the gap between commensal E. coli and harmful Shigella.,"Polyamines are small molecules associated with a wide variety of physiological functions. Bacterial pathogens have developed subtle strategies to exploit polyamines or manipulate polyamine-related processes to optimize fitness within the host. During the transition from its innocuous E. coli ancestor, Shigella, the aetiological agent of bacillary dysentery, has undergone drastic genomic rearrangements affecting the polyamine profile. A pathoadaptation process involving the speG gene and the cad operon has led to spermidine accumulation and loss of cadaverine. While a higher spermidine content promotes the survival of Shigella within infected macrophages, the lack of cadaverine boosts the pathogenic potential of the bacterium in host tissues. Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) display the same pathogenicity process as Shigella, but have a higher infectious dose and a higher metabolic activity. Pathoadaption events affecting the cad locus have occurred also in EIEC, silencing cadaverine production. Since EIEC are commonly regarded as evolutionary intermediates between E. coli and Shigella, we investigated on their polyamine profile in order to better understand which changes have occurred along the path to pathogenicity. By functional and molecular analyses carried out in EIEC strains belonging to different serotypes, we show that speG has been silenced in one strain only, favouring resistance to oxidative stress conditions and survival within macrophages. At the same time, we observe that the content of spermidine and putrescine, a relevant intermediate in the synthesis of spermidine, is higher in all strains as compared to E. coli. This may represent an evolutionary response to the lack of cadaverine. Indeed, restoring cadaverine synthesis decreases the expression of the speC gene, whose product affects putrescine production. In the light of these results, we discuss the possible impact of pathoadaptation events on the evolutionary emergence of a polyamine profile favouring to the pathogenic lifestyle of Shigella and EIEC.","['Campilongo R', 'Di Martino ML', 'Marcocci L', 'Pietrangeli P', 'Leuzzi A', 'Grossi M', 'Casalino M', 'Nicoletti M', 'Micheli G', 'Colonna B', 'Prosseda G']",2014,9,9,PLoS One,"Campilongo R, et al.

25187968,The cofilin phosphatase slingshot homolog 1 (SSH1) links NOD1 signaling to actin remodeling.,"NOD1 is an intracellular pathogen recognition receptor that contributes to anti-bacterial innate immune responses, adaptive immunity and tissue homeostasis. NOD1-induced signaling relies on actin remodeling, however, the details of the connection of NOD1 and the actin cytoskeleton remained elusive. Here, we identified in a druggable-genome wide siRNA screen the cofilin phosphatase SSH1 as a specific and essential component of the NOD1 pathway. We show that depletion of SSH1 impaired pathogen induced NOD1 signaling evident from diminished NF-κB activation and cytokine release. Chemical inhibition of actin polymerization using cytochalasin D rescued the loss of SSH1. We further demonstrate that NOD1 directly interacted with SSH1 at F-actin rich sites. Finally, we show that enhanced cofilin activity is intimately linked to NOD1 signaling. Our data thus provide evidence that NOD1 requires the SSH1/cofilin network for signaling and to detect bacterial induced changes in actin dynamics leading to NF-κB activation and innate immune responses.","['Bielig H', 'Lautz K', 'Braun PR', 'Menning M', 'Machuy N', 'Brügmann C', 'Barisic S', 'Eisler SA', 'Andree M', 'Zurek B', 'Kashkar H', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Hausser A', 'Meyer TF', 'Kufer TA']",2014,10,9,PLoS Pathog,"Bielig H, et al.

25174528,"Serotype-conversion in Shigella flexneri: identification of a novel bacteriophage, Sf101, from a serotype 7a strain.","BACKGROUND: Shigella flexneri is the major cause of bacillary dysentery in the developing countries. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen of S. flexneri plays an important role in its pathogenesis and also divides S. flexneri into 19 serotypes. All the serotypes with an exception for serotype 6 share a common O-antigen backbone comprising of N-acetylglucosamine and three rhamnose residues. Different serotypes result from modification of the basic backbone conferred by phage-encoded glucosyltransferase and/or acetyltransferase genes, or plasmid-encoded phosphoethanolamine transferase. Recently, a new site for O-acetylation at positions 3 and 4 of RhaIII, in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a and Y was shown to be mediated by the oacB gene. Additionally, this gene was shown to be carried by a transposon-like structure inserted upstream of the adrA region on the chromosome.
RESULTS: In this study, a novel bacteriophage Sf101, encoding the oacB gene was isolated and characterised from a serotype 7a strain. The complete sequence of its 38,742 bp genome encoding 66 open reading frames (orfs) was determined. Comparative analysis revealed that phage Sf101 has a mosaic genome, and most of its proteins were >90% identical to the proteins from 12 previously characterised lambdoid phages. In addition, the organisation of Sf101 genes was found to be highly similar to bacteriophage Sf6. Analysis of the Sf101 OacB identified two amino acid substitutions in the protein; however, results obtained by NMR spectroscopy confirmed that Sf101-OacB was functional. Inspection of the chromosomal integration site of Sf101 phage revealed that this phage integrates in the sbcB locus, thus unveiling a new site for integration of serotype-converting phages of S. flexneri, and determining an alternative location of oacB gene in the chromosome. Furthermore, this study identified oacB gene in several serotype 7a isolates from various regions providing evidence of O-acetyl modification in serotype 7a.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the isolation of bacteriophage Sf101 which contains the S. flexneri O-antigen modification gene oacB. Sf101 has a highly mosaic genome and was found to integrate in the sbcB locus. These findings contribute an advance in our current knowledge of serotype converting phages of S. flexneri.","['Jakhetia R', 'Marri A', 'Ståhle J', 'Widmalm G', 'Verma NK']",2014,15,1,BMC Genomics,"Jakhetia R, et al.

The present study aimed to determine changing characteristics of rotavirus diarrhea in under-5 children at two periods of time.
METHODS: We enrolled 5,357 under-5 children with rotavirus positive in two different time periods; i) 1993-1997 (n = 2,493), and ii) 2008-2012 (n = 2,864) considering beginning and ending of two decades. These children were enrolled in the urban Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b.
RESULTS: Overall, proportion of rotavirus was about 25% in 1993-97, which was 42% in 2008-12 (68% rise; p<0.001). Significant higher proportion of children were stunted [38% vs. 22%; aOR-1.33 (95% CI-1.09-1.62)], had vomiting [87% vs. 74%; aOR-2.58 (95% CI-2.02-3.28)], fever [10% vs. 8%; aOR-1.31 (95% CI-0.96-1.78)], family members >5 [38% vs. 35%; aOR-1.32 (95% CI-1.10-1.58)] required more intravenous fluid [9% vs. 3%; aOR-4.93 (95% CI-3.19-7.63)], had higher co-infection with Shigella [3% vs. 1%; aOR-3.36 (95% CI-1.61-7.03)], Vibrio cholerae [4% vs. 1%; aOR-3.70 (95% CI-2.12-6.46)]; and ETEC [13% vs. 7%; aOR-2.21 (95% CI-1.65-2.97)]; however, significantly lower proportion of them used sanitary toilets [54% vs. 78%; aOR-0.66 (95% CI-0.54-0.80)], boiled drinking water [16% vs. 38%; aOR-0.60 (95% CI-0.48-0.74)], used antimicrobial at home [63% vs. 82%; aOR-0.56 (95% CI-0.46-0.69)] and had some or severe dehydration [18% vs. 34%; aOR-0.15 (95% CI-0.12-0.20)] in 1st observation period compared to that of 2nd.

UPEC causes infections in the urogenital tract, whereas the other species colonize and, to varying degrees, invade the intestinal tract. Type III secretion systems used to breach the mucosal barrier by the intestinal pathogens revealed distinct expression patterns in different host environments. Dynamic adaptations to changes in nutrient availability and oxygen were observed, including increased reliance on anaerobic respiration and mixed acid fermentation in vivo. Utilization of carbon and nitrogen resources by the bacteria varied considerably depending on the host model investigated. Shigellae and UPEC adapted to metal ion sequestration in the mammalian host by enhancing expression of various receptors and transporters for iron and zinc. This appears to reflect the preferred intracellular life stage of Shigella spp. and responses of UPEC to high levels of lipocalin and lactotransferrin in the urinary tract.","['Suh MJ', 'Kuntumalla S', 'Yu Y', 'Pieper R']",2014,11,5,Expert Rev Proteomics,"Suh MJ, et al.

25148655,Tuberculosis and the risk of infection with other intracellular bacteria: a population-based study.,"SUMMARY Persons who develop tuberculosis (TB) may have subtle immune defects that could predispose to other intracellular bacterial infections (ICBIs). We obtained data on TB and five ICBIs (Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Listeria monocytogenes) reported to the Tennessee Department of Health, USA, 2000-2011. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) comparing ICBIs in persons who developed TB and ICBIs in the Tennessee population, adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity were estimated. IRRs were not significantly elevated for all ICBIs combined [IRR 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.06]. C. trachomatis rate was lowest in the year post-TB diagnosis (IRR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.70). More Salmonella infections occurred in extrapulmonary TB compared to pulmonary TB patients (IRR 14.3, 95% CI 1.67-122); however, this appeared to be related to HIV co-infection. TB was not associated with an increased risk of other ICBIs. In fact, fewer C. trachomatis infections occurred after recent TB diagnosis. Reasons for this association, including reduced exposure, protection conferred by anti-TB drugs or macrophage activation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection warrant further investigation.","['Huaman MA', 'Fiske CT', 'Jones TF', 'Warkentin J', 'Shepherd BE', 'Ingram LA', 'Maruri F', 'Sterling TR']",2015,143,5,Epidemiol Infect,"Huaman MA, et al.

25141906,Linear synthesis of the branched pentasaccharide repeats of O-antigens from Shigella flexneri 1a and 1b demonstrating the major steric hindrance associated with type-specific glucosylation.,"Shigella flexneri serotypes 1b and 1a are Gram-negative enteroinvasive bacteria causing shigellosis in humans. The O-antigen from S. flexneri 1b is a { → 2)-[3Ac/4Ac]-α-L-RHAP-(1 → 2)-α-L-Rhap-(1 → 3)-[2Ac]-α-L-Rhap-(1 → 3)-[α-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)]-β-D-GlcpNAc-(1 → }n branched polysaccharide ({(Ac)AB(Ac)C(E)D}n). It is identical to that from S. flexneri 1a, except for the 2C-acetate. A concise synthesis of the disaccharide ED, trisaccharides (Ac)C(E)D and C(E)D, tetrasaccharides B(Ac)C(E)D and BC(E)D, and pentasaccharides AB(Ac)C(E)D and ABC(E)D is described starting from a 2-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide acceptor and using the imidate glycosylation chemistry. The E residue was efficiently introduced via a potent stereoselective [E + D] coupling. In contrast, harsh conditions and appropriate tuning of the donor were required for a high yielding [C + ED] glycosylation. Irrespective of the level of steric bulk at residue C, glycosylation at O-3D of the ED acceptor generated a major change of conformation of the D residue within the obtained C(E)D trisaccharide, as attested by NMR data. Proper manipulation of the constrained C(E)D trisaccharide was necessary to proceed with the stepwise chain elongation at O-3C of an acceptor having the 2C-O-acetyl already in place. The protected intermediates went through a one- to three-step deprotection sequence to give the propyl glycoside targets, as portions of the O-antigens from both S. flexneri 1a and 1b. Protecting group removal was clearly associated with conformational relief, yielding oligosaccharides, for which NMR data were consistent with a (4)C1 conformation for the 3,4-di-O-glycosylated residue D, as in the native bacterial polymers.","['Hargreaves JM', 'Le Guen Y', 'Guerreiro C', 'Descroix K', 'Mulard LA']",2014,12,39,Org Biomol Chem,"Hargreaves JM, et al.

25135504,Shigellosis in Poland in 2012.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis according to European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) Report is registered in all countries of the European Union (EU) and of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) with exception of Italy and Luxemburg. The incidence rate in Poland below 0.1/100 000 of population is the lowest among the EU/EFTA countries.
AIM: To assess epidemiological situation of shigellosis in Poland in 2012 in comparison to preceding years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An assessment of the epidemiological situation of shigellosis was based on the results from an analysis of the yearly annual bulletins: ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012"", reports from bacteriological laboratories and reports from individual cases and epidemiological investigations of outbreaks linked to shigellosis, sent by Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations to the Department of Epidemiology at NIZP-PZH.
RESULTS: In 2012 the tendency that the number of registered cases of shigellosis was lower than in the former years continued - only 13 confirmed cases of shigellosis were registered (incidence rate 0.03 per 100 000 inhabitantsbut in the previous year the 18 cases ( incidence rate 0.05). Cases were registered only by 6 provinces, most of the cases by the Lodz province - 4. All together 5 persons nearly 40% were infected in travel to the foreign countries. According to data from laboratories of Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations, Shigella was detected only 4 convalescents and 2 carriers. All cases of shigellosis registered in 2012, were confirmed by a hospital laboratory or a private laboratory.
CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion the above mentioned data concerning the cases of shigellosis in Poland in 2012 are not reflecting the true epidemiological situation of shigellosis in Poland.

It may lead to rare but potentially fatal various extra intestinal complications like septicemia, involvement of CNS, urinary tract and liver especially in young malnourished children. The disease is difficult to prevent as only few bacteria are required for causing infection and there is increasing infection with multi drug resistant strains. A 6-month-old infant developed septicemia caused by multi drug resistant Shigella flexneri during an episode of gastrointestinal infection. The patient was managed in the emergency ward but unfortunately the infant expired. Considering septic shock, blood culture, stool culture and other relevant investigations were done. Stool as well as blood culture yielded Shigella flexneri. The isolates were multidrug resistant. Following is a rare case presentation of Shigella septicemia with severe shock, DIC and convulsions. The case report demonstrates how shigellosis can lead to a rare life threatening complication and hence should be considered as a possibility in septicemia associated with diarrhea and vomiting in infant and young children.","['Jain S', 'Sharma M', 'Gupta R', 'Shree N', 'Kumar M']",2014,8,6,J Clin Diagn Res,"Jain S, et al.

25103195,Influence of oligomerization state on the structural properties of invasion plasmid antigen B from Shigella flexneri in the presence and absence of phospholipid membranes.,"Shigella flexneri causes bacillary dysentery, an important cause of mortality among children in the developing world. Shigella secretes effector proteins via its type III secretion system (T3SS) to promote bacterial uptake into human colonic epithelial cells. The T3SS basal body spans the bacterial cell envelope anchoring a surface-exposed needle. A pentamer of invasion plasmid antigen D lies at the nascent needle tip and invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB) is recruited into the needle tip complex on exposure to bile salts. From here, IpaB forms a translocon pore in the host cell membrane. Although the mechanism by which IpaB inserts into the membrane is unknown, it was recently shown that recombinant IpaB can exist as either a monomer or tetramer. Both of these forms of IpaB associate with membranes, however, only the tetramer forms pores in liposomes. To reveal differences between these membrane-binding events, Cys mutations were introduced throughout IpaB, allowing site-specific fluorescence labeling. Fluorescence quenching was used to determine the influence of oligomerization and/or membrane association on the accessibility of different IpaB regions to small solutes. The data show that the hydrophobic region of tetrameric IpaB is more accessible to solvent relative to the monomer. The hydrophobic region appears to promote membrane interaction for both forms of IpaB, however, more of the hydrophobic region is protected from solvent for the tetramer after membrane association. Limited proteolysis demonstrated that changes in IpaB's oligomeric state may determine the manner by which it associates with phospholipid membranes and the subsequent outcome of this association.","['Adam PR', 'Dickenson NE', 'Greenwood JC', 'Picking WL', 'Picking WD']",2014,82,11,Proteins,"Adam PR, et al.

25093593,Spatiotemporal pattern of bacillary dysentery in China from 1990 to 2009: what is the driver behind?,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the spatiotemporal pattern of bacillary dysentery (BD) in China. This study assessed the geographic distribution and seasonality of BD in China over the past two decades.
METHODS: Data on monthly BD cases in 31 provinces of China from January 1990 to December 2009 obtained from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and data on demographic and geographic factors, as well as climatic factors, were compiled. The spatial distributions of BD in the four periods across different provinces were mapped, and heat maps were created to present the seasonality of BD by geography. A cosinor function combined with Poisson regression was used to quantify the seasonal parameters of BD, and a regression analysis was conducted to identify the potential drivers of morbidity and seasonality of BD.
RESULTS: Although most regions of China have experienced considerable declines in BD morbidity over the past two decades, Beijing and Ningxia still had high BD morbidity in 2009. BD morbidity decreased more slowly in North-west China than other regions. BD in China mainly peaked from July to September, with heterogeneity in peak time between regions. Relative humidity was associated with BD morbidity and peak time, and latitude was the major predictor of BD amplitude.
CONCLUSIONS: The transmission of BD was heterogeneous in China. Improved sanitation and hygiene in North-west China, and better access to clean water and food in the big floating population in some metropolises could be the focus of future preventive interventions against BD. BD control efforts should put more emphasis on those dry areas in summer.","['Xu Z', 'Hu W', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang X', 'Tong S', 'Zhou M']",2014,9,8,PLoS One,"Xu Z, et al.

25056906,BID-dependent release of mitochondrial SMAC dampens XIAP-mediated immunity against Shigella.,"The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a potent caspase inhibitor, best known for its anti-apoptotic function in cancer. During apoptosis, XIAP is antagonized by SMAC, which is released from the mitochondria upon caspase-mediated activation of BID. Recent studies suggest that XIAP is involved in immune signaling. Here, we explore XIAP as an important mediator of an immune response against the enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri, both in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Shigella evades the XIAP-mediated immune response by inducing the BID-dependent release of SMAC from the mitochondria. Unlike apoptotic stimuli, Shigella activates the calpain-dependent cleavage of BID to trigger the release of SMAC, which antagonizes the inflammatory action of XIAP without inducing apoptosis. Our results demonstrate how the cellular death machinery can be subverted by an invasive pathogen to ensure bacterial colonization.","['Andree M', 'Seeger JM', 'Schüll S', 'Coutelle O', 'Wagner-Stippich D', 'Wiegmann K', 'Wunderlich CM', 'Brinkmann K', 'Broxtermann P', 'Witt A', 'Fritsch M', 'Martinelli P', 'Bielig H', 'Lamkemeyer T', 'Rugarli EI', 'Kaufmann T', 'Sterner-Kock A', 'Wunderlich FT', 'Villunger A', 'Martins LM', 'Krönke M', 'Kufer TA', 'Utermöhlen O', 'Kashkar H']",2014,33,19,EMBO J,"Andree M, et al.

25008817,"Transfer patterns of integron-associated and antibiotic resistance genes in S. flexneri during different time intervals in Tianjin, China.","BACKGROUND: Shigella is one of the common genera of pathogens responsible for bacterial diarrhoea in humans. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), 800,000-1,700,000 patients in China were infected with Shigella spp. in 2000, and Shigella flexneri is the most common serotype (86%).
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the transfer patterns of integron-associated and antibiotic resistance genes in S. flexneri during different time intervals in the city of Tianjin in the People's Republic of China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The integrase-encoding and variable regions of the integrons of the bacterial strains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by gene sequencing. Fifty-six S. flexneri strains, 32 of which were stored in our laboratory and the other 24 were isolated from tertiary hospitals in Tianjin during different time intervals, were tested for their sensitivity to 12 antibiotics by using the Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing method (K-B method).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of the 32 strains of S. flexneri isolated from 1981 to 1983 and stored in our laboratory, class 1 integron was detected in 28 strains (87.50%), while 27 strains (84.37%) harboured an aminoglycoside resistance gene, aadA, in the variable region of their integrons. Class 1 integron was identified in 22 (91.67%) of the 24 S. flexneri strains isolated from 2009 to 2010, whereas the variable region and 3'-end amplification were not present in any of the strains. Class 2 integron was not found in the 1981-1983 group (group A) of strains; although 19 (79.17%) of the 24 strains in the 2009-2010 group (group B) possessed class 2 integron, and the variable region of the integron harboured dfrA1+sat1+aadA1 genes, which, respectively, mediate antibiotic resistance to trimethoprim, streptothricin and streptomycin. Seventeen strains of the total 56 possessed both class 1 and 2 integrons. Strains belonging to group A were highly resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 65.63% of the strains were multi-resistant to three or more antibiotics. In group B, the strains showed high resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin and tetracycline; 83.33% of the strains were multi-resistant to three or more antibiotics. Class 1 and 2 integrons exist extensively in S. flexneri, and the 3'-conserved segments of class 1 integron may have deletion or other types of mutations. Comparing the antibiotic and multi-drug resistance of group A with that of group B, it is apparent that the antibiotic resistance and the incidence of genes that confer multi-drug resistance have increased over the years in S. flexneri.","['Wang J', 'Liang F', 'Wu XM', 'Qi W']",2014,32,3,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Wang J, et al.

24975703,Hot-spot analysis to dissect the functional protein-protein interface of a tRNA-modifying enzyme.,"Interference with protein-protein interactions of interfaces larger than 1500 Å² by small drug-like molecules is notoriously difficult, particularly if targeting homodimers. The tRNA modifying enzyme Tgt is only functionally active as a homodimer. Thus, blocking Tgt dimerization is a promising strategy for drug therapy as this protein is key to the development of Shigellosis. Our goal was to identify hot-spot residues which, upon mutation, result in a predominantly monomeric state of Tgt. The detailed understanding of the spatial location and stability contribution of the individual interaction hot-spot residues and the plasticity of motifs involved in the interface formation is a crucial prerequisite for the rational identification of drug-like inhibitors addressing the respective dimerization interface. Using computational analyses, we identified hot-spot residues that contribute particularly to dimer stability: a cluster of hydrophobic and aromatic residues as well as several salt bridges. This in silico prediction led to the identification of a promising double mutant, which was validated experimentally. Native nano-ESI mass spectrometry showed that the dimerization of the suggested mutant is largely prevented resulting in a predominantly monomeric state. Crystal structure analysis and enzyme kinetics of the mutant variant further support the evidence for enhanced monomerization and provide first insights into the structural consequences of the dimer destabilization.","['Jakobi S', 'Nguyen TX', 'Debaene F', 'Metz A', 'Sanglier-Cianférani S', 'Reuter K', 'Klebe G']",2014,82,10,Proteins,"Jakobi S, et al.

24958238,Shigella isolates from the global enteric multicenter study inform vaccine development.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella, a major diarrheal disease pathogen worldwide, is the target of vaccine development. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) investigated burden and etiology of moderate-to-severe diarrheal disease in children aged <60 months and matched controls without diarrhea during 3 years at 4 sites in Africa and 3 in Asia. Shigella was 1 of the 4 most common pathogens across sites and age strata. GEMS Shigella serotypes are reviewed to guide vaccine development.
METHODS: Subjects' stool specimens/rectal swabs were transported to site laboratories in transport media and plated onto xylose lysine desoxycholate and MacConkey agar. Suspect Shigella colonies were identified by biochemical tests and agglutination with antisera. Shigella isolates were shipped to the GEMS Reference Laboratory (Baltimore, MD) for confirmation and serotyping of S. flexneri; one-third of isolates were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for quality control.
RESULTS: Shigella dysenteriae and S. boydii accounted for 5.0% and 5.4%, respectively, of 1130 Shigella case isolates; S. flexneri comprised 65.9% and S. sonnei 23.7%. Five serotypes/subserotypes comprised 89.4% of S. flexneri, including S. flexneri 2a, S. flexneri 6, S. flexneri 3a, S. flexneri 2b, and S. flexneri 1b.
CONCLUSIONS: A broad-spectrum Shigella vaccine must protect against S. sonnei and 15 S. flexneri serotypes/subserotypes. A quadrivalent vaccine with O antigens from S. sonnei, S. flexneri 2a, S. flexneri 3a, and S. flexneri 6 can provide broad direct coverage against these most common serotypes and indirect coverage against all but 1 (rare) remaining subserotype through shared S. flexneri group antigens.","['Livio S', 'Strockbine NA', 'Panchalingam S', 'Tennant SM', 'Barry EM', 'Marohn ME', 'Antonio M', 'Hossain A', 'Mandomando I', 'Ochieng JB', 'Oundo JO', 'Qureshi S', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Tamboura B', 'Adegbola RA', 'Hossain MJ', 'Saha D', 'Sen S', 'Faruque AS', 'Alonso PL', 'Breiman RF', 'Zaidi AK', 'Sur D', 'Sow SO', 'Berkeley LY', ""O'Reilly CE"", 'Mintz ED', 'Biswas K', 'Cohen D', 'Farag TH', 'Nasrin D', 'Wu Y', 'Blackwelder WC', 'Kotloff KL', 'Nataro JP', 'Levine MM']",2014,59,7,Clin Infect Dis,"Livio S, et al.

This study aimed to determine the pathogenicity of Shigella in chickens and the possibility of cross-infection between humans and chickens. The pathogenicity of Shigella in chickens was examined via infection of three-day-old SPF chickens with Shigella strain ZD02 isolated from a human patient. The virulence and invasiveness were examined by infection of the chicken intestines and primary chicken intestinal epithelial cells. The results showed Shigella can cause death via intraperitoneal injection in SPF chickens, but only induce depression via crop injection. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy revealed the Shigella can invade the intestinal epithelia. Immunohistochemistry of the primary chicken intestinal epithelial cells infected with Shigella showed the bacteria were internalized into the epithelial cells. Electron microscopy also confirmed that Shigella invaded primary chicken intestinal epithelia and was encapsulated by phagosome-like membranes. Our data demonstrate that Shigella can invade primary chicken intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and chicken intestinal mucosa in vivo, resulting in pathogenicity and even death. The findings suggest Shigella isolated from human or chicken share similar pathogenicity as well as the possibility of human-poultry cross-infection, which is of public health significance.","['Shi R', 'Yang X', 'Chen L', 'Chang HT', 'Liu HY', 'Zhao J', 'Wang XW', 'Wang CQ']",2014,9,6,PLoS One,"Shi R, et al.

METHODS: 2010 and 2011 notification data for dengue, hepatitis A, hepatitis E, malaria, paratyphoid fever, shigellosis and typhoid fever were extracted from the NSW Notifiable Conditions Information Management System and analysed for travel-associated risk factors.
RESULTS: Where place of acquisition was known, the proportion of cases for whom the disease was acquired overseas ranged from 48.7% for shigellosis to 100% for hepatitis E, malaria and typhoid. Over half of hepatitis A (53.3%), hepatitis E (74.2%), malaria (54.5%), paratyphoid (53.3%) and typhoid (65.7%) cases were associated with travel to the person's country of birth. Hepatitis A vaccination rates were significantly lower among overseas-acquired than locally-acquired cases (4.8% vs 22.2%, Χ(2)=6.58, p<0.02).
CONCLUSION: A large proportion of selected enteric and vectorborne disease case notifications were associated with overseas travel. All potential travellers should be made aware of the risks and available preventive measures, such as vaccination against hepatitis A and typhoid fever, taking precautions with food and water and use of malaria chemoprophylaxis, where appropriate. Improvements in data on risk factors, reason for travel and barriers to the use of preventive measures would better inform prevention strategies.","['Gunaratnam P', 'Tobin S', 'Seale H', 'McAnulty JM']",2014,24,4,N S W Public Health Bull,"Gunaratnam P, et al.

24935977,Elongation factor P and modifying enzyme PoxA are necessary for virulence of Shigella flexneri.,"Elongation factor P (EF-P) is a universally conserved bacterial translation factor. In many bacteria, EF-P is posttranslationally modified by PoxA, which covalently attaches a β-lysine to a conserved lysine residue of EF-P. Here we show that both EF-P and PoxA are necessary for virulence of the human diarrheal pathogen Shigella flexneri. Loss of either EF-P or PoxA leads to an impaired ability of S. flexneri to invade epithelial cells and form plaques in an epithelial cell monolayer. Proteomic analysis of efp and poxA deletion mutants revealed decreased levels of several virulence effector proteins, including IpaA, -B, and -C and IcsA. Additionally, mRNA levels of virB and virF, which encode master virulence regulators, were decreased in the efp mutant. The reduction in virF transcription was at least partially due to decreased levels of CpxA, which activates virF through the response regulator CpxR. The role of CpxAR in reduced synthesis of VirF and its downstream effectors was indicated by restoration of invasion when a mutation resulting in constitutively activated CpxR was introduced into the efp mutant. Thus, modified EF-P is required for appropriate synthesis of proteins involved in the virulence of this bacterial pathogen.","['Marman HE', 'Mey AR', 'Payne SM']",2014,82,9,Infect Immun,"Marman HE, et al.

24889090,"Travel-related shigellosis in Quebec, Canada: an analysis of risk factors.","BACKGROUND: Travel-related shigellosis is not well documented in Canada although it is frequently acquired abroad and can cause severe disease.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of travel-related cases of shigellosis for Quebec (Canada) and to identify high-risk groups of travelers.
METHOD AND DATA SOURCES: We performed a random sampling of 335 shigellosis cases (from a total of 760 cases) reported in the provincial database of reportable diseases from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2007. Each case was analyzed according to information available in the epidemiology questionnaire. Total number of trips by region from Statistics Canada was used as denominator to estimate the risk according to region of travel.
RESULTS: Annually, between 43 and 54% of the shigellosis cases were reported in travelers, 45% of whom were aged between 20 and 44 years. Children under 11 years accounted for nearly 16% of cases, but represent only 4% of travelers. Most cases in travelers were serogroups Shigella sonnei (50%) or Shigella flexneri (45%). Almost 31% of cases were reported between January and March. The majority (64%) were acquired in Central America, Mexico, or the Caribbean. However, the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and South America had the highest ratio of number of cases per number of trips. Tourists represented 76% of the cases; 62% of them had traveled for <2 weeks. At least 15% of cases among travelers were hospitalized.
CONCLUSIONS: In Quebec, travel-related cases of shigellosis represent a large burden of total cases. Short-term travelers are at risk, as well as young children. The majority of cases occur in the winter months, corresponding to the peak of travel to ""sunshine destinations."" Continuous efforts should be made to encourage all travelers to seek pre-travel care, and to inform primary care practitioners of health risks faced by their patients abroad, even for those going to resorts.","['Trépanier S', 'Bui YG', 'Blackburn M', 'Milord F', 'Levac E', 'Gagnon S']",2014,21,5,J Travel Med,"Trépanier S, et al.

In the present work, main Shigella virulence genes was examined by PCR and compared to symptoms of pediatric shigellosis. Thirty Shigella isolates were identified from an etiologic study at which 1,339 children ranging 0-10 years old were enrolled. S. flexneri was the most frequent species reaching 60.0% of isolates, 22.2% were S. sonnei, and 6.6% were both S. dysenteriae and S. boydii. All Shigella infected children had diarrhea, but not all were accompanied by others symptoms of bacillary dysentery. Among major virulence genes, the PCR typing revealed ipaBCD was present in all isolates, followed by IpaH7.8, set-1A, set-1B, sen/ospD3, virF, and invE. The pathogenic potential of the ShET-1B subunit was observed in relation to dehydration (P < 0.001) and ShET-2 related to the intestinal injury (P = 0.033) evidenced by the presence of bloody diarrhea.

24867262,Potential biomarkers and latent pathways for vasculitis based on latent pathway identification analysis.,"AIM: We aimed in this study to identify the significant latent pathways and precise molecular mechanisms underlying the syndrome of vasculitis.
METHODS: Agilent dual-channel data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls and vasculitis patients were downloaded from EBI Array Express database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and vasculitis PBMCs samples were selected. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were carried out to identify significant biological processes and pathways. DEGs were matched to NetBox software database to obtain LINKER genes with statistical significance. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed with LINKER genes and DEGs according to STRING database. Latent pathway identification analysis (LPIA) was used to identify the most significant interactions among different pathways involved by DEGs.
RESULTS: A total of 266 DEGs were selected. GO and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in defense and wounding response; the down-regulated genes were enriched in immune response. The modules analysis of PPI network suggested that ISG15 and IFIT3 were the potential biomarkers for vasculitis. The results of LPIA showed that NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and shigellosis related pathway were the two most significant latent pathway interactions for vasculitis. ISG15 and IFIT3 were the potential biomarkers for vasculitis identification.
CONCLUSION: NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and shigellosis related pathway were the most significant latent pathway interactions for vasculitis. Moreover, LPIA was a useful method for revealing systemic biological pathways and cellular mechanisms of diseases.","['Zhou T', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu P', 'Sun Q', 'Guo Y', 'Yang Y']",2014,17,6,Int J Rheum Dis,"Zhou T, et al.

24863068,B lymphocytes undergo TLR2-dependent apoptosis upon Shigella infection.,"Antibody-mediated immunity to Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, requires several episodes of infection to get primed and is short-lasting, suggesting that the B cell response is functionally impaired. We show that upon ex vivo infection of human colonic tissue, invasive S. flexneri interacts with and occasionally invades B lymphocytes. The induction of a type three secretion apparatus (T3SA)-dependent B cell death is observed in the human CL-01 B cell line in vitro, as well as in mouse B lymphocytes in vivo. In addition to cell death occurring in Shigella-invaded CL-01 B lymphocytes, we provide evidence that the T3SA needle tip protein IpaD can induce cell death in noninvaded cells. IpaD binds to and induces B cell apoptosis via TLR2, a signaling receptor thus far considered to result in activation of B lymphocytes. The presence of bacterial co-signals is required to sensitize B cells to apoptosis and to up-regulate tlr2, thus enhancing IpaD binding. Apoptotic B lymphocytes in contact with Shigella-IpaD are detected in rectal biopsies of infected individuals. This study therefore adds direct B lymphocyte targeting to the diversity of mechanisms used by Shigella to dampen the host immune response.","['Nothelfer K', 'Arena ET', 'Pinaud L', 'Neunlist M', 'Mozeleski B', 'Belotserkovsky I', 'Parsot C', 'Dinadayala P', 'Burger-Kentischer A', 'Raqib R', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Phalipon A']",2014,211,6,J Exp Med,"Nothelfer K, et al.

Herein, the influence of the polysaccharide non-stoichiometric di-O-acetylation on antigenicity is addressed for the first time. Three decasaccharides, representing relevant internal mono- and di-O-acetylation profiles of the O-antigen, were synthesized from a pivotal protected decasaccharide designed to tailor late stage site-selective O-acetylation. The latter was obtained via a convergent route involving the imidate glycosylation chemistry. Binding studies to five protective mIgGs showed that none of the acetates adds significantly to broad antibody recognition. Yet, one of the five antibodies had a unique pattern of binding.

Here we have attempted to elucidate the contribution of the periplasmic enzyme, L-asparaginase (AnsB) to the pathogenesis of S. flexneri. Using a reverse genetic approach we found that ansB mutants showed reduced adherence to epithelial cells in vitro and attenuation in two in vivo models of shigellosis, the Caenorhabditis elegans and the murine pulmonary model. To investigate how AnsB affects bacterial adherence, we compared the proteomes of the ansB mutant with its wild type parental strain using two dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis and identified the outer membrane protein, OmpA as up-regulated in ansB mutant cells. Bacterial OmpA, is a prominent outer membrane protein whose activity has been found to be required for bacterial pathogenesis. Overexpression of OmpA in wild type S. flexneri serotype 3b resulted in decreasing the adherence of this virulent strain, suggesting that the up-regulation of OmpA in ansB mutants contributes to the reduced adherence of this mutant strain.

Significant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was detected in the culture supernatant when HeLa cells were infected with Shigella at a high multiplicity of infection. Drp1 inhibition with Mdivi-1 and siRNA knockdown significantly reduced LDH release. HeLa cell death was also accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation. Tubular mitochondrial networks were partially restored when Drp1 was depleted with either siRNA or inhibited with Mdivi-1. Surprisingly either Mdivi-1 treatment or Drp1 siRNA-depletion of HeLa cells also reduced Shigella plaque formation.

Shigellosis-containing strategies, mostly single or multiple interventions, are implemented by primary-level health departments. Systematic assessment of the effectiveness of these measures is scarce. To estimate the efficacy of commonly used intervention strategies, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious/Asymptomatic-Recovered-Water model. No intervention was predicted to result in a total attack rate (TAR) of 90% of the affected population (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86.65-92.80) and duration of outbreak (DO) of 89 days, and the use of single-intervention strategies can be futile or even counter-productive. Prophylactics and water disinfection did not improve TAR or DO. School closure for up to 3 weeks did not help but only increased DO. Isolation alone significantly increased DO. Only antibiotics treatment could shorten the DO to 35 days with TAR unaffected. We observed that these intervention effects were additive when in combined usage under most circumstances. Combined intervention ""Isolation+antibiotics+prophylactics+water disinfection"" was predicted to result in the lowest TAR (41.9%, 95%CI: 36.97-47.04%) and shortest DO (28 days). Our actual Shigellosis control implementation that also included school closure for 1 week, attained comparable results and the modeling produced an epidemic curve of Shigellosis highly similar to our actual outbreak data. This lends a strong support to the reality of our model that provides a possible reference for public health professionals to evaluate their strategies towards Shigellosis control.","['Chen T', 'Leung RK', 'Zhou Z', 'Liu R', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang L']",2014,9,4,PLoS One,"Chen T, et al.

24722587,Host and bacterial proteins that repress recruitment of LC3 to Shigella early during infection.,"Shigella spp. are intracytosolic gram-negative pathogens that cause disease by invasion and spread through the colonic mucosa, utilizing host cytoskeletal components to form propulsive actin tails. We have previously identified the host factor Toca-1 as being recruited to intracellular S. flexneri and being required for efficient bacterial actin tail formation. We show that at early times during infection (40 min.), the type three-secreted effector protein IcsB recruits Toca-1 to intracellular bacteria and that recruitment of Toca-1 is associated with repression of recruitment of LC3, as well as with repression of recruitment of the autophagy marker NDP52, around these intracellular bacteria. LC3 is best characterized as a marker of autophagosomes, but also marks phagosomal membranes in the process LC3-associated phagocytosis. IcsB has previously been demonstrated to be required for S. flexneri evasion of autophagy at late times during infection (4-6 hr) by inhibiting binding of the autophagy protein Atg5 to the Shigella surface protein IcsA (VirG). Our results suggest that IcsB and Toca-1 modulation of LC3 recruitment restricts LC3-associated phagocytosis and/or LC3 recruitment to vacuolar membrane remnants. Together with published results, our findings suggest that IcsB inhibits innate immune responses in two distinct ways, first, by inhibiting LC3-associated phagocytosis and/or LC3 recruitment to vacuolar membrane remnants early during infection, and second, by inhibiting autophagy late during infection.","['Baxt LA', 'Goldberg MB']",2014,9,4,PLoS One,Baxt LA and Goldberg MB.

24721572,IcsA is a Shigella flexneri adhesin regulated by the type III secretion system and required for pathogenesis.,"Following contact with the epithelium, the enteric intracellular bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri invades epithelial cells and escapes intracellular phagosomal destruction using its type III secretion system (T3SS). The bacterium replicates within the host cell cytosol and spreads between cells using actin-based motility, which is mediated by the virulence factor IcsA (VirG). Whereas S. flexneri invasion is well characterized, adhesion mechanisms of the bacterium remain elusive. We found that IcsA also functions as an adhesin that is both necessary and sufficient to promote contact with host cells. As adhesion can be beneficial or deleterious depending on the host cell type, S. flexneri regulates IcsA-dependent adhesion. Activation of the T3SS in response to the bile salt deoxycholate triggers IcsA-dependent adhesion and enhances pathogen invasion. IcsA-dependent adhesion contributes to virulence in a mouse model of shigellosis, underscoring the importance of this adhesin to S. flexneri pathogenesis.","['Brotcke Zumsteg A', 'Goosmann C', 'Brinkmann V', 'Morona R', 'Zychlinsky A']",2014,15,4,Cell Host Microbe,"Brotcke Zumsteg A, et al.

24696690,The Relation between Helicobacter pylori Infection and Acute Bacterial Diarrhea in Children.,"Background. H. pylori infection leads to chronic gastritis in both children and adults. But recently, there are arising theories of its protective effect in diarrheal diseases. Aim. To explore the prevalence of H. pylori infection in children with bacterial diarrhea and compare it with healthy controls. Patients and Methods. Two matched groups consisted of 122 consecutive children, aged 24-72 months old, with acute bacterial diarrhea, who had Shigellosis (N = 68) and Salmonellosis (N = 54) as patients group and 204 healthy asymptomatic children as control group enrolled in this study. Results. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in healthy control children was significantly higher than in patients group, (odds ratio = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.33-9.5, P = 0.007). In our study, only 2/54 Salmonella infected patients and 3/68 of Shigellosis had evidence of H. pylori infection, while normal control children had 27/204 infected individuals. Conclusion. H. pylori infection may play a protective role against bacterial diarrhea in children. So it is important to consider all of the positive and negative aspects of H. pylori infection before its eradication.","['Monajemzadeh M', 'Abbasi A', 'Tanzifi P', 'Taba Taba Vakili S', 'Irani H', 'Kashi L']",2014,2014,,Int J Pediatr,"Monajemzadeh M, et al.

The gene cassettes dfrA17-aadA5, dfrA12-orfF-aadA2, and arr-3-aacA4 were found in typical class 1 integrons. The gene cassettes blaOXA-1-aadA1 and dfrA1-sat1-aadA1 were detected in atypical class 1 integrons and in class 2 integrons, respectively. This is the first report of arr-3-aacA4 cassette detected in typical class 1 integrons among Shigella isolates. Rates of antibiotic resistance were different between integron-positive and integron-negative strains (P < 0.05), and all integron-positive isolates were resistant to at least 3 different antimicrobial agents. Typical class 1 integron-positive isolates showed higher resistance rates to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin than did integron-negative ones (P < 0.05). Typical class 1 integrons and β-lactamase genes were found in conjugative plasmids, otherwise class 2 and atypical class 1 integrons were located on chromosome.

24680068,Quantitative microbial risk assessment of antibacterial hand hygiene products on risk of shigellosis.,"There are conflicting reports on whether antibacterial hand hygiene products are more effective than nonantibacterial products in reducing bacteria on hands and preventing disease. This research used new laboratory data, together with simulation techniques, to compare the ability of nonantibacterial and antibacterial products to reduce shigellosis risk. One hundred sixtythree subjects were used to compare five different hand treatments: two nonantibacterial products and three antibacterial products, i.e., 0.46% triclosan, 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, or 62% ethyl alcohol. Hands were inoculated with 5.5 to 6 log CFU Shigella; the simulated food handlers then washed their hands with one of the five products before handling melon balls. Each simulation scenario represented an event in which 100 people would be exposed to Shigella from melon balls that had been handled by food workers with Shigella on their hands. Analysis of experimental data showed that the two nonantibacterial treatments produced about a 2-log reduction on hands. The three antibacterial treatments showed log reductions greater than 3 but less than 4 on hands. All three antibacterial treatments resulted in statistically significantly lower concentration on the melon balls relative to the nonantibacterial treatments. A simulation that assumed 1 million Shigella bacteria on the hands and the use of a nonantibacterial treatment predicted that 50 to 60 cases of shigellosis would result (of 100 exposed). Each of the antibacterial treatments was predicted to result in an appreciable number of simulations for which the number of illness cases would be 0, with the most common number of illness cases being 5 (of 100 exposed). These effects maintained statistical significance from 10(6) Shigella per hand down to as low as 100 Shigella per hand, with some evidence to support lower levels. This quantitative microbial risk assessment shows that antibacterial hand treatments can significantly reduce Shigella risk.","['Schaffner DW', 'Bowman JP', 'English DJ', 'Fischler GE', 'Fuls JL', 'Krowka JF', 'Kruszewski FH']",2014,77,4,J Food Prot,"Schaffner DW, et al.

24671799,Serological identification and prevalence of a novel O-antigen epitope linked to 3- and 4-O-acetylated rhamnose III of lipopolysaccharide in Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri is the major cause of shigellosis in developing countries. All serotypes except for serotype 6 share an O-antigen backbone composed of a → 2)-α-L-Rhap(III)-(1 → 2)-α-l-Rhap(II)-(1 → 3)-α-l-Rhap(I)-(1 → 3)-β-D-GlcpNAc-(1 → tetrasaccharide repeat. It can be modified by the addition of a glucosyl group to one or more sugar residues and/or an O-acetyl group to Rha(I) and/or a phosphoethanolamine to Rha(II) and/or Rha(III). These modifications give rise to type I-, IC-, II-, IV-, and V- and to group 6-, 7,8-, and MASF IV-1-specific antigenic determinants, which comprise the current serotyping scheme of S. flexneri. Recently, another O-antigen modification created by adding an O-acetyl group to Rha(III) at position 3 or 4 (3/4-O-acetylation) has been found in S. flexneri serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, Y, and 6. A new O-acyltransferase gene named oacB has been shown to mediate the 3/4-O-acetylation in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and Y but not in 6. In this work, we studied the distribution of the 3/4-O-acetylation in S. flexneri and the antigenicity that resulted from this modification. PCR screening of the oacB gene in clinical isolates of S. flexneri demonstrated that the oacB-mediated 3/4-O-acetylation is widespread in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and Y. Serological analysis indicated that this modification confers the host with a novel antigenic determinant that is provisionally named group O factor 9. These findings enhance our understanding of the varieties of O-antigenic determinants related to O-antigen modification in S. flexneri and will assist epidemiological studies and vaccine development.","['Wang J', 'Lan R', 'Knirel YA', 'Luo X', 'Senchenkova SN', 'Shashkov AS', 'Xu J', 'Sun Q']",2014,52,6,J Clin Microbiol,"Wang J, et al.

In these countries the under five years of age mortality rates reach 100 per 1000 live births, of which a significant proportion are associated with acute diarrhea. Rotavirus, cryptosporidium, Shigella spp and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are the main pathogens causing disease in these settings, although other bacteria and parasites can cause moderate to severe disease in different regions and situations. Treatment of children in these setting should be focused on appropriate rehydration, early hospitalization of severely malnourished children, zinc supplementation, and in specific situations, antimicrobials should be considered.

Consequently, treatment with Ibrutinib, a specific Btk inhibitor currently used in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, effectively impaired S. flexneri spread from cell to cell.

24595138,Development of an Aotus nancymaae model for Shigella Vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy studies.,"Several animal models exist to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of candidate Shigella vaccines. The two most widely used nonprimate models for vaccine development include a murine pulmonary challenge model and a guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis model. Nonhuman primate models exhibit clinical features and gross and microscopic colonic lesions that mimic those induced in human shigellosis. Challenge models for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Campylobacter spp. have been successfully developed with Aotus nancymaae, and the addition of a Shigella-Aotus challenge model would facilitate the testing of combination vaccines. A series of experiments were designed to identify the dose of Shigella flexneri 2a strain 2457T that induces an attack rate of 75% in the Aotus monkey. After primary challenge, the dose required to induce an attack rate of 75% was calculated to be 1 × 10(11) CFU. Shigella-specific immune responses were low after primary challenge and subsequently boosted upon rechallenge. However, preexisting immunity derived from the primary challenge was insufficient to protect against the homologous Shigella serotype. A successive study in A. nancymaae evaluated the ability of multiple oral immunizations with live-attenuated Shigella vaccine strain SC602 to protect against challenge. After three oral immunizations, animals were challenged with S. flexneri 2a 2457T. A 70% attack rate was demonstrated in control animals, whereas animals immunized with vaccine strain SC602 were protected from challenge (efficacy of 80%; P = 0.05).

24587010,Cucurbitacin IIb exhibits anti-inflammatory activity through modulating multiple cellular behaviors of mouse lymphocytes.,"Cucurbitacin IIb (CuIIb) is one of the major active compounds in Hemsleyadine tablets which have been used for clinical treatment of bacillary dysentery, enteritis and acute tonsilitis. However, its action mechanism has not been completely understood. This study aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory activity of CuIIb and its underlying mechanism in mitogen-activated lymphocytes isolated from mouse mesenteric lymph nodes. The results showed that CuIIb inhibited the proliferation of concanavalin A (Con A)-activated lymphocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. CuIIb treatment arrested their cell cycle in S and G2/M phases probably due to the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and the modulation of p27(Kip1) and cyclin levels. Moreover, the surface expression of activation markers CD69 and CD25 on Con A-activated CD3(+) T lymphocytes was suppressed by CuIIb treatment. Both Con A- and phorbol ester plus ionomycin-induced expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 proteins was attenuated upon exposure to CuIIb. Mechanistically, CuIIb treatment suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK and Erk1/2 but not p38 in Con A-activated lymphocytes. Although CuIIb unexpectedly enhanced the phosphorylation of IκB and NF-κB (p65), it blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (p65). In support of this, CuIIb significantly decreased the mRNA levels of IκBα and TNF-α, two target genes of NF-κB, in Con A-activated lymphocytes. In addition, CuIIb downregulated Con A-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and increased cell apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that CuIIb exhibits its anti-inflammatory activity through modulating multiple cellular behaviors and signaling pathways, leading to the suppression of the adaptive immune response.","['Wang Y', 'Zhao GX', 'Xu LH', 'Liu KP', 'Pan H', 'He J', 'Cai JY', 'Ouyang DY', 'He XH']",2014,9,2,PLoS One,"Wang Y, et al.

Porin has been categorized as primarily TLR2-ligand and here we validated its signaling procedure in colonic INT-407 cells simulating the host scenario. Porin up-regulated TLR2 and -6 followed by TLR2·MYD88 complex formation suggesting direct involvement of MYD88 for downstream signaling. Translocation of NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits on to the nucleus indicates involvement of the transcription factor in signaling. Porin-induced TLR signaling specifically stimulated the pro-inflammatory chemokine panel comprising of MIP-1α, MCP-1 and IL-8. Inhibition studies of TLR2 and NF-κB led to abrogation of the pro-inflammatory chemokine response, showing TLR-dependent signaling through NF-κB regulate gut activity.

Despite advances in the understanding of diarrheal disorders and management strategies, globally nearly 750,000 children die annually as a consequence of diarrhea.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the efficacy and effectiveness studies. We used a standardized abstraction and grading format and performed meta-analyses for all outcomes. The estimated effect of cholera, shigella, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and rotavirus vaccines was determined by applying the standard Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) rules.
RESULTS: A total of 24 papers were selected and analyzed for all the four vaccines. Based on the evidence, we propose a 74% mortality reduction in rotavirus specific mortality, 52% reduction in cholera incidence due to their respective vaccines. We did not find sufficient evidence and a suitable outcome to project mortality reductions for cholera, ETEC and shigella in children under 5 years.
CONCLUSION: Vaccines for rotavirus and cholera have the potential to reduce diarrhea morbidity and mortality burden. But there is no substantial evidence of efficacy for ETEC and shigella vaccines, although several promising vaccine concepts are moving from the development and testing pipeline towards efficacy and Phase 3 trials.","['Das JK', 'Tripathi A', 'Ali A', 'Hassan A', 'Dojosoeandy C', 'Bhutta ZA']",2013,13 Suppl 3,Suppl 3,BMC Public Health,"Das JK, et al.

Currently there is a dearth of literature exploring the effectiveness of antibiotics for diarrhea due to Cholera, Shigella and cryptosporidiosis in children.
METHODS: We reviewed the literature reporting the effect of antibiotics for the treatment of diarrhea due to Cholera, Shigella and Cryptosporidium in children under five years. We used a standardized abstraction and grading format and performed meta-analyses to determine the effect of the treatment with various antibiotics on mortality and rates of clinical and bacteriological/parasitological failure. The CHERG Standard Rules were applied to determine the final effect of treatment with antibiotics on diarrhea morbidity and mortality.
RESULTS: For Cholera; the evidence was weak to recommend any effect on mortality. For Shigella; there was no data on mortality; either all-cause or cause specific, hence we used clinical failure rates as a proxy for Shigella deaths and propose that treatment of Shigella dysentery with antibiotics can result in a 82% reduction in diarrhea mortality due to Shigella. For cryptosporidiosis; there was data on all-cause mortality but the evidence was weak hence we used clinical failure rates as a proxy for mortality to estimate that antimicrobial treatment of diarrhea due to cryptosporidiosis can result in a 54% reduction in mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to recommend antibiotic use for reduction of morbidity and mortality due to Cholera, Shigella and Cryptosporidium.

Orthodox Jewish communities, living in highly crowded conditions and with a high number of children aged <5 years were the epicentre of country-wide biennial propagated epidemics of S. sonnei shigellosis. S. flexneri was the leading Shigella serogroup in Israeli Arabs. S. flexneri 2a and S. flexneri 6 alternated as the most common serotypes. Both S. sonnei and S. flexneri isolates showed high rates of resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and very low rates of resistance to quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. Shigellosis due to S. sonnei conferred 81% (95% confidence interval 69-89) protection against the homologous Shigella serotype when epidemic exposure re-occurred 2 years later. These data are of value in the process of Shigella vaccine development.","['Cohen D', 'Bassal R', 'Goren S', 'Rouach T', 'Taran D', 'Schemberg B', 'Peled N', 'Keness Y', 'Ken-Dror S', 'Vasilev V', 'Nissan I', 'Agmon V', 'Shohat T']",2014,142,12,Epidemiol Infect,"Cohen D, et al.

24555739,"Molecular characterization and PCR-based replicon typing of multidrug resistant Shigella sonnei isolates from an outbreak in Thimphu, Bhutan.","BACKGROUND: Shigella species are an important cause of diarrhea in developing countries. These bacteria normally acquire their antibiotic resistance via several different mobile genetic elements including plasmids, transposons, and integrons involving gene cassettes. During a diarrhea surveillance study in Thimphu, Bhutan in June and July, 2011, Shigella sonnei were isolated more frequently than expected. This study describes the antibiotic resistance of these S. sonnei isolates.
METHODS: A total of 29 S. sonnei isolates from Thimphu, Bhutan was characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility by disc diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. All isolates were tested by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with restriction enzyme XbaI and were tested for plasmid. The plasmid patterns and the PFGE patterns were analyzed by Bionumerics software. DNA sequencing was performed on amplified products for gyraseA gene and class 1 and class 2 integrons. S. sonnei isolates were classified for incompatibility of plasmids by PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT).
RESULTS: These S. sonnei were resistant to multiple drugs like ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, and tetracycline but susceptible to azithromycin. All isolates had class 2 integrons dfrA1, sat1 and aadA1 genes. Two point mutations in Gyrase A subunit at position Ser83Leu and Asp87Gly were detected in these quinolone resistant isolates. The plasmid and PFGE patterns of S. sonnei isolates suggested a clonal relationship of the isolates. All isolates carried common ColE plasmid. ColE plasmid co-resided with B/O plasmid (nine isolates) or I1 plasmid (one isolate).
CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of 29 S. sonnei isolates from Thimphu, Bhutan in June and July, 2011 are identical in PFGE, plasmid and resistance pattern. This study suggests that these recent S. sonnei isolates are clonally related and multidrug-resistant.","['Ruekit S', 'Wangchuk S', 'Dorji T', 'Tshering KP', 'Pootong P', 'Nobthai P', 'Serichantalergs O', 'Poramathikul K', 'Bodhidatta L', 'Mason CJ']",2014,7,,BMC Res Notes,"Ruekit S, et al.

24551265,"Estimating diarrheal illness and deaths attributable to Shigellae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli among older children, adolescents, and adults in South Asia and Africa.","INTRODUCTION: While Shigellae and strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are important causes of diarrhea-associated morbidity and mortality among infants and young children (<5 years of age), their health impact in older age groups is unclear. We sought to quantify the overall burden of shigellosis and ETEC diarrhea among older children, adolescents, and adults in Africa and South Asia, the two regions with the highest levels of diarrhea-related morbidity and mortality worldwide.
METHODS: We employed two distinct methodological approaches to estimate the burden of diarrhea due to Shigellae and ETEC among persons ≥ 5 years of age in the WHO regions of South Asia (SEAR) and Africa (AFR). Under method 1, we conducted a systematic review to identify the median proportion of total deaths due to diarrhea and then applied this figure to the number of all-cause deaths that occurred in 2010 among this age group. To estimate the total number of diarrhea deaths attributable to Shigellae and ETEC, we subsequently applied previously published estimates of the median percentage of diarrhea hospitalizations due to Shigellae and ETEC to the estimated number of diarrhea deaths. For method 2, we applied previously published incidence rates to 2010 population figures and estimated the total number of episodes due to Shigellae and ETEC using published estimates of the average proportion of pathogen-positive outpatients from studies of >4 pathogens. We then estimated the number of pathogen-specific deaths by determining the number of hospitalized patients and applying the case-fatality rate.
RESULTS: By method 1, there were 19,451 deaths due to Shigellae and 42,973 due to ETEC in AFR, and 20,691 due to Shigellae and 45,713 due to ETEC in SEAR in 2010. By method 2, there were 15.0 million ETEC episodes and 30.4 million episodes due to Shigellae in AFR, and 28.7 million episodes due to ETEC and 58.1 million episodes due to Shigellae in SEAR in 2010. We were unable to identify published case-fatality rates for ETEC and thus could only estimate Shigellae-related deaths using method 2, by which there were 5,308 and 10,158 Shigellae-related deaths in AFR and SEAR in 2010, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Methods 1 and 2 underscore the importance of Shigellae and ETEC as major causes of morbidity and mortality among older children, adolescents, and adults in AFR and SEAR. Understanding the epidemiology of these pathogens is imperative for the development and use of future vaccines and other preventative interventions.","['Lamberti LM', 'Bourgeois AL', 'Fischer Walker CL', 'Black RE', 'Sack D']",2014,8,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lamberti LM, et al.

Gene disruption studies have validated VirF as a potential target for an anti-virulence therapy to treat shigellosis by determining that VirF is necessary for virulence, but not required for bacterial viability. Using a bacteria-based, β-galactosidase reporter assay we completed a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign monitoring VirF activity in the presence of over 140,000 small molecules. From our screening campaign, we identified five lead compounds to pursue in tissue culture-based invasion and cell-to-cell spread assays, and toxicity screens. Our observations of activity in these models for infection have validated our approach of targeting virulence regulation and have allowed us to identify a promising chemical scaffold from our HTS for hit-to-lead development. Interestingly, differential effects on invasion versus cell-to-cell spread suggest that the compounds' efficacies may depend, in part, on the specific promoter that VirF is recognizing.","['Emanuele AA', 'Adams NE', 'Chen YC', 'Maurelli AT', 'Garcia GA']",2014,67,5,J Antibiot (Tokyo),"Emanuele AA, et al.

24528873,Coverage of diarrhoea-associated Escherichia coli isolates from different origins with two types of phage cocktails.,"Eighty-nine T4-like phages from our phage collection were tested against four collections of childhood diarrhoea-associated Escherichia coli isolates representing different geographical origins (Mexico versus Bangladesh), serotypes (69 O, 27 H serotypes), pathotypes (ETEC, EPEC, EIEC, EAEC, VTEC, Shigella), epidemiological settings (community and hospitalized diarrhoea) and years of isolation. With a cocktail consisting of 3 to 14 T4-like phages, we achieved 54% to 69% coverage against predominantly EPEC isolates from Mexico, 30% to 53% against mostly ETEC isolates from a prospective survey in Bangladesh, 24% to 61% against a mixture of pathotypes isolated from hospitalized children in Bangladesh, and 60% coverage against Shigella isolates. In comparison a commercial Russian phage cocktail containing a complex mixture of many different genera of coliphages showed 19%, 33%, 50% and 90% coverage, respectively, against the four above-mentioned collections. Few O serotype-specific phages and no broad-host range phages were detected in our T4-like phage collection. Interference phenomena between the phage isolates were observed when constituting larger phage cocktails. Since the coverage of a given T4-like phage cocktail differed with geographical area and epidemiological setting, a phage composition adapted to a local situation is needed for phage therapy approaches against E. coli pathogens.","['Bourdin G', 'Navarro A', 'Sarker SA', 'Pittet AC', 'Qadri F', 'Sultana S', 'Cravioto A', 'Talukder KA', 'Reuteler G', 'Brüssow H']",2014,7,2,Microb Biotechnol,"Bourdin G, et al.

Freshly harvested suspensions of S. flexneri 2a vaccine candidates WRSf2G12 and WRSf2G15 as well as S. sonnei vaccine candidate WRSs3 were nasogastrically administered to groups of rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, either in a monovalent form or when combined with each other. The animals were monitored daily for physical well-being, stools were subjected to quantitative colony immunoblot assays for bacterial excretion and blood and stools were evaluated for humoral and mucosal immune responses. No clinical symptoms were noted in any group of animals and the vaccine candidates were excreted robustly for 48-72h without significant changes in either the magnitude or duration of excretion when given as a monovalent or as bivalent mixtures. Similarly, immunological interferences were not apparent in the magnitude of humoral and mucosal immune responses observed toward Shigella-specific antigens when monkeys were fed monovalent or bivalent formulations. These results predict that a multivalent live oral vaccine of more than one serotype can have a favorable outcome for protection against shigellosis.","['Ranallo RT', 'Kaminski R', 'Baqar S', 'Dutta M', 'Lugo-Roman LA', 'Boren T', 'Barnoy S', 'Venkatesan MM']",2014,32,15,Vaccine,"Ranallo RT, et al.

24522098,"Notes from the field: Shigella with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin among men who have sex with men - United States, 2002-2013.","Bacteria of the genus Shigella cause approximately 500,000 illnesses each year in the United States. Diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever, and stomach cramps typically start 1-2 days after exposure and usually resolve in 5-7 days. For patients with severe disease, bloody diarrhea, or compromised immune systems, antibiotic treatment is recommended, but resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is common. For multidrugresistant cases, azithromycin, the most frequently prescribed antibiotic in the United States, is recommended for both children and adults. However, not all Shigellae are susceptible to azithromycin. Nonsusceptible isolates exist but are not usually identified because there are no clinical laboratory guidelines for azithromycin susceptibility testing. However, to monitor susceptibility of Shigellae in the United States, CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) has, since 2011, routinely measured the azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for every 20th Shigella isolate submitted from public health laboratories to CDC, as well as outbreak-associated isolates. All known U.S. Shigella isolates with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin (DSA-Shigella), and the illnesses caused by them, are described in this report.","['Heiman KE', 'Karlsson M', 'Grass J', 'Howie B', 'Kirkcaldy RD', 'Mahon B', 'Brooks JT', 'Bowen A', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']",2014,63,6,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Heiman KE, et al.

24516440,Colicin type 7 produced by majority of Shigella sonnei isolated from Thai patients with diarrhoea.,"Thirty one out of 153 strains of Shigella sonnei isolated from Thai patients with diarrhoea showed antibacterial activity against S. sonnei by agar well diffusion method. All of them harbor plasmids with the genetic determination of colicin type 7 (Js) gene but without colicin E and colicin U gene. The PCR product obtained from strain 35/44 was shown to be the gene for colicin type 7 lytic protein (cja). The partially purified bacteriocin (PPB) containing colicin type 7 of strain 35/44 was prepared and used for characterization. The antibacterial activity of PPB against a total of 17 selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was tested. It was found that PPB of strain 35/44 was active against E. coli O157, S. sonnei and S. boydii. The sensitivity of PPB from this strain to proteinase K, trypsin and α-chymotrypsin suggests the proteinaceous nature of these antimicrobial substances. Therefore, this isolated bacterium can be regarded as bacteriocin producing bacteria. The bacteriocin produced by this isolated S. sonnei was heat stable as evidenced by its ability to maintain the activity at 80 °C for 60 min. In addition, it was stable within a wide range of pH (3-9). The molecular weight of colicin type 7 from isolated S. sonnei strain 35/44 analyzed by SDS-PAGE was 54.4 kDa composing of at least five subunits.

24509314,Identification of an O-acyltransferase gene (oacB) that mediates 3- and 4-O-acetylation of rhamnose III in Shigella flexneri O antigens.,"O antigen (O polysaccharide) is an important and highly variable cell component present on the surface of cells which defines the serospecificity of Gram-negative bacteria. Most O antigens of Shigella flexneri, a cause of shigellosis, share a backbone composed of →2)-α-l-Rhap(III)-(1→2)-α-l-Rhap(II)-(1→3)-α-l-Rhap(I)-(1→3)-β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→ repeats, which can be modified by adding various substituents, giving rise to 19 serotypes. The known modifications include glucosylation on various sugar residues, O-acetylation on Rha(I), and phosphorylation with phosphoethanolamine on Rha(II) or/and Rha(III). Recently, two new O-antigen modifications, namely, O-acetylation at position 3 or 4 of Rha(III) and position 6 of GlcNAc, have been identified in several S. flexneri serotypes. In this work, the genetic basis for the 3/4-O-acetylation on Rha(III) was elucidated. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome of S. flexneri serotype 2a strain Sf301, which carries 3/4-O-acetylation on Rha(III), revealed an O-acyltransferase gene designated oacB. Genetic studies combined with O-antigen structure analysis demonstrated that this gene is responsible for the 3/4-O-acetylation in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, and Y but not serotype 6, which has a different O-antigen backbone structure. The oacB gene is carried by a transposon-like structure located in the proA-adrA region on the chromosome, which represents a novel mechanism of mobilization of O-antigen modification factors in S. flexneri. These findings enhance our knowledge of S. flexneri O-antigen modifications and shed light on the origin of new O-antigen variants.","['Wang J', 'Knirel YA', 'Lan R', 'Senchenkova SN', 'Luo X', 'Perepelov AV', 'Wang Y', 'Shashkov AS', 'Xu J', 'Sun Q']",2014,196,8,J Bacteriol,"Wang J, et al.

This study was performed to identify the common bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility in children with diarrhea.
METHODS: Children under 14 years old with acute diarrhea who referred to Amirkola Children's Hospital, Mazandaran, North of Iran, were enrolled during the summer and fall of 2009. From each patient, two fecal specimens were collected. Samples were cultured and bacterial isolation was done by conventional methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was identified by disk diffusion and micro dilution methods.
RESULTS: One hundred-seventy two patients with the mean age of 41.8±37.6 months were evaluated. The bacteria were isolated in 48 (27.9%) cases. The most common isolated bacteria was E.coli and then shigella in both bloody and nonbloody diarrheal patients. There was a significant difference between bacteria positive specimens and WBC in stool smear (p=0.003). All isolated shigella were susceptible to Ceftizoxime and ciprofloxacin and were resistant to Cefixime. Resistant to Nalidixic acid was seen in 14% of them.
CONCLUSION: The results show that E.coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen in children with bloody and nonbloody diarrhea. Ceftizoxime is a good antibiotic for shigellosis in children in our area but Cefixime is not appropriate.","['Esmaeili Dooki MR', 'Rajabnia R', 'Barari Sawadkohi R', 'Mosaiebnia Gatabi Z', 'Poornasrollah M', 'Mirzapour M']",2014,5,1,Caspian J Intern Med,"Esmaeili Dooki MR, et al.

24452172,Genomic portrait of the evolution and epidemic spread of a recently emerged multidrug-resistant Shigella flexneri clone in China.,"Shigella flexneri is the major cause of shigellosis in developing countries. A new S. flexneri serotype, Xv, appeared in 2000 and replaced serotype 2a as the most prevalent serotype in China. Serotype Xv is a variant of serotype X, with phosphoethanolamine modification of its O antigen mediated by a plasmid that contained the opt gene. Serotype Xv isolates belong to sequence type 91 (ST91). In this study, whole-genome sequencing of 59 S. flexneri isolates of 14 serotypes (serotypes 1 to 4, Y, Yv, X, and Xv) indicated that ST91 arose around 1993 by acquiring multidrug resistance (MDR) and spread across China within a decade. A comparative analysis of the chromosome and opt-carrying plasmid pSFXv_2 revealed independent origins of 3 serotype Xv clusters in China, with different divergence times. Using 18 cluster-dividing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SNP typing divided 380 isolates from 3 provinces (Henan, Gansu, and Anhui) into 5 SNP genotypes (SGs). One SG predominated in each province, but substantial interregional spread of SGs was also evident. These findings suggest that MDR is the key selective pressure for the emergence of the S. flexneri epidemic clone and that Shigella epidemics in China were caused by a combination of local expansion and interregional spread of serotype Xv.","['Zhang N', 'Lan R', 'Sun Q', 'Wang J', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Yu D', 'Hu W', 'Hu S', 'Dai H', 'Du P', 'Wang H', 'Xu J']",2014,52,4,J Clin Microbiol,"Zhang N, et al.

METHODS: Early-warning signals and response time were analyzed by using three approaches of CIDARS. Positive rates of early-warning signals and error early-warning rates prior and after the adjustment,were compared.
RESULTS: Totally, 114 585 early-warning signals appeared, with an average response time of 1.35 hours from April 21, 2008 to December 31, 2012. There were 12,394 early-warning signals in terms of fixed threshold method with a positive rate of 7.96%. 85 727 early-warning signals appeared under the mobile percentile method with a positive rate of 0.85%. There were 16,464 early-warning signals by using accumulation and control chart methods,with a positive rate of 1.82%. Results showed there was a positive correlation between the number of reported cases and the number of early-warning signals (r = 0.924, P < 0.01).

We determined the epidemiology of Shigella spp. in these populations. We retrospectively reviewed Shigella spp. stool isolations between 2005-2009. Overall, 3295 isolates were analyzed. S. sonnei was isolated in 2057/3295 (62.4%) and S. flexneri in 1058 (32.1%). S. sonnei was isolated in 1567/1707 (91.8%) from Jewish patients and S. flexneri in 931/1542 (60.4%) from Bedouin patients. Ampicillin resistance increased linearly from 217/373 (58.2%) in 2005 to 186/256 (72.7%) in 2009, (P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance decreased linearly from 328/373 (87.9%) in 2005 to 133/256 (51.9%) in 2009 (P < 0.001). Higher resistance of Shigella spp. to ampicilin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were found in Jewish patients: 1527/1706 (89.5%) versus 977/1542 (63.4%) (P < 0.0001), 1635/1706 (95.8%) versus 1026/1542 (66.5%) (P < 0.0001).

24416167,"Spatio-temporal trends and risk factors for Shigella from 2001 to 2011 in Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the spatial and temporal trends of Shigella incidence rates in Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China. It also intended to explore complex risk modes facilitating Shigella transmission.
METHODS: County-level incidence rates were obtained for analysis using geographic information system (GIS) tools. Trend surface and incidence maps were established to describe geographic distributions. Spatio-temporal cluster analysis and autocorrelation analysis were used for detecting clusters. Based on the number of monthly Shigella cases, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model successfully established a time series model. A spatial correlation analysis and a case-control study were conducted to identify risk factors contributing to Shigella transmissions.
RESULTS: The far southwestern and northwestern areas of Jiangsu were the most infected. A cluster was detected in southwestern Jiangsu (LLR = 11674.74, P<0.001). The time series model was established as ARIMA (1, 12, 0), which predicted well for cases from August to December, 2011. Highways and water sources potentially caused spatial variation in Shigella development in Jiangsu. The case-control study confirmed not washing hands before dinner (OR = 3.64) and not having access to a safe water source (OR = 2.04) as the main causes of Shigella in Jiangsu Province.
CONCLUSION: Improvement of sanitation and hygiene should be strengthened in economically developed counties, while access to a safe water supply in impoverished areas should be increased at the same time.","['Tang F', 'Cheng Y', 'Bao C', 'Hu J', 'Liu W', 'Liang Q', 'Wu Y', 'Norris J', 'Peng Z', 'Yu R', 'Shen H', 'Chen F']",2014,9,1,PLoS One,"Tang F, et al.

24385347,Shiga toxins expressed by human pathogenic bacteria induce immune responses in host cells.,"Shiga toxins are a family of genetically and structurally related toxins that are the primary virulence factors produced by the bacterial pathogens Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 and certain Escherichia coli strains. The toxins are multifunctional proteins inducing protein biosynthesis inhibition, ribotoxic and ER stress responses, apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. The regulated induction of inflammatory responses is key to minimizing damage upon injury or pathogen-mediated infections, requiring the concerted activation of multiple signaling pathways to control cytokine/chemokine expression. Activation of host cell signaling cascades is essential for Shiga toxin-mediated proinflammatory responses and the contribution of the toxins to virulence. Many studies have been reported defining the inflammatory response to Shiga toxins in vivo and in vitro, including production and secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α/β (MIP-1α/β), macrophage chemoattractant monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and Groβ. These cytokines and chemokines may contribute to damage in the colon and development of life threatening conditions such as acute renal failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome) and neurological abnormalities. In this review, we summarize recent findings in Shiga toxin-mediated inflammatory responses by different types of cells in vitro and in animal models. Signaling pathways involved in the inflammatory responses are briefly reviewed.","['Lee MS', 'Kim MH', 'Tesh VL']",2013,51,6,J Microbiol,"Lee MS, et al.

25763015,Relationship among Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) and their differentiation.,"Shigellosis produces inflammatory reactions and ulceration on the intestinal epithelium followed by bloody or mucoid diarrhea. It is caused by enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) as well as any species of the genus Shigella, namely, S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei. This current species designation of Shigella does not specify genetic similarity. Shigella spp. could be easily differentiated from E. coli, but difficulties observed for the EIEC-Shigella differentiation as both show similar biochemical traits and can cause dysentery using the same mode of invasion. Sequencing of multiple housekeeping genes indicates that Shigella has derived on several different occasions via acquisition of the transferable forms of ancestral virulence plasmids within commensal E. coli and form a Shigella-EIEC pathovar. EIEC showed lower expression of virulence genes compared to Shigella, hence EIEC produce less severe disease than Shigella spp. Conventional microbiological techniques often lead to confusing results concerning the discrimination between EIEC and Shigella spp. The lactose permease gene (lacY) is present in all E. coli strains but absent in Shigella spp., whereas β-glucuronidase gene (uidA) is present in both E. coli and Shigella spp. Thus uidA gene and lacY gene based duplex real-time PCR assay could be used for easy identification and differentiation of Shigella spp. from E. coli and in particular EIEC.","['Ud-Din A', 'Wahid S']",2014,45,4,Braz J Microbiol,Ud-Din A and Wahid S.

24376024,CGTase-catalysed cis-glucosylation of L-rhamnosides for the preparation of Shigella flexneri 2a and 3a haptens.,"We report the enzymatic synthesis of α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-L-rhamnopyranoside and α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-L-rhamnopyranoside by using a wild-type transglucosidase in combination with glucoamylase and glucose oxidase. It was shown that Bacillus circulans 251 cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2.1.4.19) can efficiently couple an α-L-rhamnosyl acceptor to a maltodextrin molecule with an α-(1→4) linkage, albeit in mixture with the α-(1→3) regioisomer, thus giving two glucosylated acceptors in a single reaction. Optimisation of the CGTase coupling reaction with β-cyclodextrin as the donor substrate and methyl or allyl α-L-rhamnopyranoside as acceptors resulted in good conversion yields (42-70%) with adjustable glycosylation regioselectivity. Moreover, the efficient chemical conversion of the products of CGTase-mediated cis-glucosylation into protected building blocks (previously used in the synthesis of O-antigen fragments of several Shigella flexneri serotypes) was substantiated. These novel chemoenzymatic strategies towards useful, convenient intermediates in the synthesis of S. flexneri serotypes 2a and 3a oligosaccharides might find applications in developments towards synthetic carbohydrate-based vaccine candidates against bacillary dysentery.","['Urbach C', 'Halila S', 'Guerreiro C', 'Driguez H', 'Mulard LA', 'Armand S']",2014,15,2,Chembiochem,"Urbach C, et al.

24372251,Shigella vaccine development: prospective animal models and current status.,"Shigella was first discovered in 1897 and is a major causative agent of dysenteric diarrhea. The number of affected patients has decreased globally because of improved sanitary conditions; however, Shigella still causes serious problems in many subjects, including young children and the elderly, especially in developing countries. Although antibiotics may be effective, a vaccine would be the most powerful solution to combat shigellosis because of the emergence of drug-resistant strains. However, the development of a vaccine is hampered by several problems. First, there is no suitable animal model that can replace human-based studies for the investigation of the in vivo mechanisms of Shigella vaccines. Mouse, guinea pig, rat, rabbit, and nonhuman primates could be used as models for shigellosis, but they do not represent human shigellosis and each has its own weaknesses. However, a recent murine model based on peritoneal infection with virulent S. flexneri 2a is promising. Moreover, although the inflammatory responses and mechanisms such as pathogenassociated molecular patterns and danger-associated molecular patterns have been studied, the pathology and immunology of Shigella are still not clearly defined. Despite these obstacles, many vaccine candidates have been developed, including live attenuated, killed whole cells, conjugated, and subunit vaccines. The development of Shigella vaccines also demands considerations of the cost, routes of administration, ease of storage (stability), cross-reactivity, safety, and immunogenicity. The main aim of this review is to provide a detailed introduction to the many promising vaccine candidates and animal models currently available, including the newly developed mouse model.","['Kim YJ', 'Yeo SG', 'Park JH', 'Ko HJ']",2013,14,10,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,"Kim YJ, et al.

24367527,Changing trends in the prevalence of Shigella species: emergence of multi-drug resistant Shigella sonnei biotype g in Bangladesh.,"Shigellosis, caused by Shigella species, is a major public health problem in Bangladesh. To determine the prevalence and distribution of different Shigella species, we analyzed 10,827 Shigella isolates from patients between 2001 and 2011. S. flexneri was the predominant species isolated throughout the period. However, the prevalence of S. flexneri decreased from 65.7% in 2001 to 47% in 2011, whereas the prevalence of S. sonnei increased from 7.2% in 2001 to 25% in 2011. S. boydii and S. dysenteriae accounted for 17.3% and 7.7% of the isolates respectively throughout the period. Of 200 randomly selected S. sonnei isolates for extensive characterization, biotype g strains were predominant (95%) followed by biotype a (5%). Resistance to commonly used antibiotics including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, mecillinam and ampicillin was 89.5%, 86.5%, 17%, 10.5%, and 9.5%, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and imipenem. Ninety-eight percent of the strains had integrons belonging to class 1, 2 or both. The class 1 integron contained only dfrA5 gene, whereas among class 2 integron, 16% contained dhfrAI-sat1-aadA1-orfX gene cassettes and 84% harbored dhfrA1-sat2 gene cassettes. Plasmids of ∼5, ∼1.8 and ∼1.4 MDa in size were found in 92% of the strains, whereas only 33% of the strains carried the 120 MDa plasmid. PFGE analysis showed that strains having different integron patterns belonged to different clusters. These results show a changing trend in the prevalence of Shigella species with the emergence of multidrug resistant S. sonnei. Although S. flexneri continues to be the predominant species albeit with reduced prevalence, S. sonnei has emerged as the second most prevalent species replacing the earlier dominance by S. boydii and S. dysenteriae in Bangladesh.","['Ud-Din AI', 'Wahid SU', 'Latif HA', 'Shahnaij M', 'Akter M', 'Azmi IJ', 'Hasan TN', 'Ahmed D', 'Hossain MA', 'Faruque AS', 'Faruque SM', 'Talukder KA']",2013,8,12,PLoS One,"Ud-Din AI, et al.

Poor quality of centralized water supplies and sewage systems, biological and chemical contamination of drinking water, as well as contamination of food products, promote widespread infectious diseases, significantly exceeding nationwide rates in the population living in the two-thirds of Russian northern territories.
OBJECTIVES: The general aim was to assess the levels of food- and waterborne diseases in selected regions of Russian Arctic, Siberia and the Far East (for the period 2000-2011), and to compare disease levels among regions and with national levels in Russia.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is the first comparative assessment of the morbidity in these fields of the population of 18 selected regions of Russian Arctic, Siberia and the Far East, using official statistical sources. The incidences of infectious and parasitic food- and waterborne diseases among the general population (including indigenous peoples) have been analyzed in selected regions (per 100,000 of population, averaged for 2000-2011).
RESULTS: Among compulsory registered infectious and parasitic diseases, there were high rates and widespread incidences in selected regions of shigellosis, yersiniosis, hepatitis A, tularaemia, giardiasis, enterobiasis, ascariasis, diphyllobothriasis, opistorchiasis, echinococcosis and trichinellosis.
CONCLUSION: Incidences of infectious and parasitic food- and waterborne diseases in the general population of selected regions of the Russian Arctic, Siberia and the Far East (2000-2011) are alarmingly high. Parallel solutions must be on the agenda, including improvement of sanitary conditions of cities and settlements in the regions, modernization of the water supply and of the sewage system.

24349586,Laboratory-based prospective surveillance for community outbreaks of Shigella spp. in Argentina.,"BACKGROUND: To implement effective control measures, timely outbreak detection is essential. Shigella is the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea in Argentina. Highly resistant clones of Shigella have emerged, and outbreaks have been recognized in closed settings and in whole communities. We hereby report our experience with an evolving, integrated, laboratory-based, near real-time surveillance system operating in six contiguous provinces of Argentina during April 2009 to March 2012.
METHODOLOGY: To detect localized shigellosis outbreaks timely, we used the prospective space-time permutation scan statistic algorithm of SaTScan, embedded in WHONET software. Twenty three laboratories sent updated Shigella data on a weekly basis to the National Reference Laboratory. Cluster detection analysis was performed at several taxonomic levels: for all Shigella spp., for serotypes within species and for antimicrobial resistance phenotypes within species. Shigella isolates associated with statistically significant signals (clusters in time/space with recurrence interval ≥365 days) were subtyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using PulseNet protocols.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In three years of active surveillance, our system detected 32 statistically significant events, 26 of them identified before hospital staff was aware of any unexpected increase in the number of Shigella isolates. Twenty-six signals were investigated by PFGE, which confirmed a close relationship among the isolates for 22 events (84.6%). Seven events were investigated epidemiologically, which revealed links among the patients. Seventeen events were found at the resistance profile level. The system detected events of public health importance: infrequent resistance profiles, long-lasting and/or re-emergent clusters and events important for their duration or size, which were reported to local public health authorities.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The WHONET-SaTScan system may serve as a model for surveillance and can be applied to other pathogens, implemented by other networks, and scaled up to national and international levels for early detection and control of outbreaks.","['Viñas MR', 'Tuduri E', 'Galar A', 'Yih K', 'Pichel M', 'Stelling J', 'Brengi SP', 'Della Gaspera A', 'van der Ploeg C', 'Bruno S', 'Rogé A', 'Caffer MI', 'Kulldorff M', 'Galas M', 'Group MIDAS - Argentina']",2013,7,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Viñas MR, et al.

24332032,A Shigella effector dampens inflammation by regulating epithelial release of danger signal ATP through production of the lipid mediator PtdIns5P.,"Upon infection with Shigella flexneri, epithelial cells release ATP through connexin hemichannels. However, the pathophysiological consequence and the regulation of this process are unclear. Here we showed that in intestinal epithelial cell ATP release was an early alert response to infection with enteric pathogens that eventually promoted inflammation of the gut. Shigella evolved to escape this inflammatory reaction by its type III secretion effector IpgD, which blocked hemichannels via the production of the lipid PtdIns5P. Infection with an ipgD mutant resulted in rapid hemichannel-dependent accumulation of extracellular ATP in vitro and in vivo, which preceded the onset of inflammation. At later stages of infection, ipgD-deficient Shigella caused strong intestinal inflammation owing to extracellular ATP. We therefore describe a new paradigm of host-pathogen interaction based on endogenous danger signaling and identify extracellular ATP as key regulator of mucosal inflammation during infection. Our data provide new angles of attack for the development of anti-inflammatory molecules.","['Puhar A', 'Tronchère H', 'Payrastre B', 'Nhieu GT', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2013,39,6,Immunity,"Puhar A, et al.

In addition, a cohort study was performed among the attendees of a banquet in Tromsø where food from delicatessen X had been served and where some people had reported being ill. A trace-back investigation was initiated. In total, 46 cases were confirmed (Tromsø= 42; Sarpsborg= 4). Having eaten basil pesto sauce or fish soup at the banquet in Tromsø were independent risk factors for disease. Basil pesto was the only common food item that had been consumed by confirmed cases occurring in Tromsø and Sarpsborg. The basil had been imported and delivered to both municipalities by the same supplier. No basil from the specific batch was left on the Norwegian market when it was identified as the likely source.

24324266,First evidence for a covalent linkage between enterobacterial common antigen and lipopolysaccharide in Shigella sonnei phase II ECALPS.,"Enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) is expressed by Gram-negative bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae, including emerging drug-resistant pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Recent studies have indicated the importance of ECA for cell envelope integrity, flagellum expression, and resistance of enteric bacteria to acetic acid and bile salts. ECA, a heteropolysaccharide built from the trisaccharide repeating unit, →3)-α-D-Fucp4NAc-(1→4)-β-D-ManpNAcA-(1→4)-α-D-GlcpNAc-(1→, occurs as a cyclic form (ECA(CYC)), a phosphatidylglycerol (PG)-linked form (ECA(PG)), and an endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-associated form (ECA(LPS)). Since the discovery of ECA in 1962, the structures of ECA(PG) and ECA(CYC) have been completely elucidated. However, no direct evidence has been presented to support a covalent linkage between ECA and LPS; only serological indications of co-association have been reported. This is paradoxical, given that ECA was first identified based on the capacity of immunogenic ECA(LPS) to elicit antibodies cross-reactive with enterobacteria. Using a simple isolation protocol supported by serological tracking of ECA epitopes and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, we have succeeded in the first detection, isolation, and complete structural analysis of poly- and oligosaccharides of Shigella sonnei phase II ECA(LPS). ECA(LPS) consists of the core oligosaccharide substituted with one to four repeating units of ECA at the position occupied by the O-antigen in the case of smooth S. sonnei phase I. These data represent the first structural evidence for the existence of ECA(LPS) in the half-century since it was first discovered and provide insights that could prove helpful in further structural analyses and screening of ECA(LPS) among Enterobacteriaceae species.","['Gozdziewicz TK', 'Lugowski C', 'Lukasiewicz J']",2014,289,5,J Biol Chem,"Gozdziewicz TK, et al.

Diagnostic criteria for ReA do not exist and, therefore, it is subject to clinical opinion resulting in cases with a wide range of symptoms and definitions. Using standardized diagnostic criteria, we conducted a systematic literature review to establish the global incidence of ReA for each of the three most commonly-associated enteric pathogens: Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella. The weighted mean incidence of reactive arthritis was 9, 12, and 12 cases per 1,000 cases of Campylobacter, Salmonella and Shigella infections respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of worldwide data that use well-defined criteria to characterize diarrhoea-associated ReA.

25848501,Magnitude of drug resistant shigellosis in Nepalese patients.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Shigella plays an important role as a causative organism of acute gastroenteritis, in children and others. Rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance warrants continuous monitoring of susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates. We report here our findings about Shigella spp. isolates and their drug resistance patterns in Nepalese patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 507 Nepalese patients with acute gastroenteritis attending outpatient and inpatient departments of Nepalgunj Medical college and teaching Hospital, Banke, Nepal from September 2011 to April 2013. Stool specimens were processed for isolation and identification of Shigella species following the standard microbiological methods while the disc diffusion test was used to determine antimicrobial resistance patterns of the recovered isolates at the central Laboratory of Microbiology.
RESULTS: Sixty nine isolates were identified as Shigella species. S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. boydii and S. sonnei accounted, respectively, for 42.03%, 27.54%, 21.74% and 8.70% of the total number of Shigella isolates. Resistance to nalidixic acid (95.65%), ampicillin (85.51%), co-trimoxazole (82.61%) and ciprofloxacin (47.83%) was observed. Among 69 isolates, 29 (42.03%) were from children aged 1-10 years and this group was statistically significant (P < 0.05), compared to the other age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed endemicity of shigellosis with S. flexneri as the predominant serogroup in Nepalese patients. Children were at a higher risk of severe shigellosis. Nalidixic acid, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and ciprofloxacin should not be used empirically as the first line drugs in treatment of shigellosis. Continuous local monitoring of resistance patterns is necessary for the appropriate selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy.","['Khan S', 'Singh P', 'Asthana A', 'Ansari M']",2013,5,4,Iran J Microbiol,"Khan S, et al.

24167293,Intracellular Shigella remodels its LPS to dampen the innate immune recognition and evade inflammasome activation.,"LPS is a potent bacterial effector triggering the activation of the innate immune system following binding with the complex CD14, myeloid differentiation protein 2, and Toll-like receptor 4. The LPS of the enteropathogen Shigella flexneri is a hexa-acylated isoform possessing an optimal inflammatory activity. Symptoms of shigellosis are produced by severe inflammation caused by the invasion process of Shigella in colonic and rectal mucosa. Here we addressed the question of the role played by the Shigella LPS in eliciting a dysregulated inflammatory response of the host. We unveil that (i) Shigella is able to modify the LPS composition, e.g., the lipid A and core domains, during proliferation within epithelial cells; (ii) the LPS of intracellular bacteria (iLPS) and that of bacteria grown in laboratory medium differ in the number of acyl chains in lipid A, with iLPS being the hypoacylated; (iii) the immunopotential of iLPS is dramatically lower than that of bacteria grown in laboratory medium; (iv) both LPS forms mainly signal through the Toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 pathway; (v) iLPS down-regulates the inflammasome-mediated release of IL-1β in Shigella-infected macrophages; and (vi) iLPS exhibits a reduced capacity to prime polymorfonuclear cells for an oxidative burst. We propose a working model whereby the two forms of LPS might govern different steps of the invasive process of Shigella. In the first phases, the bacteria, decorated with hypoacylated LPS, are able to lower the immune system surveillance, whereas, in the late phases, shigellae harboring immunopotent LPS are fully recognized by the immune system, which can then successfully resolve the infection.","['Paciello I', 'Silipo A', 'Lembo-Fazio L', 'Curcurù L', 'Zumsteg A', 'Noël G', 'Ciancarella V', 'Sturiale L', 'Molinaro A', 'Bernardini ML']",2013,110,46,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Paciello I, et al.

24152499,Role of 30 kDa antigen of enteric bacterial pathogens as a possible arthritogenic factor in post-dysenteric reactive arthritis.,"BACKGROUND: Reactive arthritis (ReA)/Reiter's syndrome (RS) may be caused as a sequel of infections caused by enteric bacterial pathogens, although the mechanisms through, which different pathogens cause similar disease are not clear.
AIM: This study was done to look for the presence and role of any common bacterial antigen among the pathogens isolated from such patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 patients of ReA and 75 controls (three groups of 25 subjects each: Group 1: Patients who did not develop arthritic complications within 3 months after bacillary dysentery/diarrhea; Group 2: Patients with other arthritic diseases and Group 3: Normal healthy subjects) were included. The isolated enteric pathogens were tested to detect the immunodominant antigens.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A common 30 kDa antigen was found to be specifically present among seven arthritogenic enteric bacterial strains belonging to three genera, Salmonella, Shigella and Hafnia. Post-dysenteric ReA patients' sera show higher levels of immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin A antibodies against this antigen as compared to the controls. Lymphocytes of ReA patients recognize this antigen, proliferate and produce interleukin-2 in response to this antigen more than the lymphocytes of controls. 30 kDa antigen may be a common arthritogenic factor associated with post-dysenteric ReA/RS. The association of Hafnia alvei with post-dysenteric ReA is described for the first time. Four cases of mycobacterial ReA had an association with this antigen, suggesting that the arthritogenic antigen of mycobacteria and enteric bacteria may be of a similar nature.","['Singh M', 'Ganguli NK', 'Singh H', 'Deodhar SD', 'Sethi S', 'Sharma M']",2013,56,3,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,"Singh M, et al.

This recognition depends on the detection of microbial compounds presented by the evolutionarily conserved major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) class I molecule, MR1. Here we show that MAIT cells display cytotoxic activity towards MR1 overexpressing non-hematopoietic cells cocultured with bacteria. The NK receptor, CD161, highly expressed by MAIT cells, modulated the cytokine but not the cytotoxic response triggered by bacteria infected cells. MAIT cells are also activated by and kill epithelial cells expressing endogenous levels of MRI after infection with the invasive bacteria Shigella flexneri. In contrast, MAIT cells were not activated by epithelial cells infected by Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. Finally, MAIT cells are activated in human volunteers receiving an attenuated strain of Shigella dysenteriae-1 tested as a potential vaccine. Thus, in humans, MAIT cells are the most abundant T cell subset able to detect and kill bacteria infected cells.","['Le Bourhis L', 'Dusseaux M', 'Bohineust A', 'Bessoles S', 'Martin E', 'Premel V', 'Coré M', 'Sleurs D', 'Serriari NE', 'Treiner E', 'Hivroz C', 'Sansonetti P', 'Gougeon ML', 'Soudais C', 'Lantz O']",2013,9,10,PLoS Pathog,"Le Bourhis L, et al.

24101689,Analysis of the proteome of intracellular Shigella flexneri reveals pathways important for intracellular growth.,"Global proteomic analysis was performed with Shigella flexneri strain 2457T in association with three distinct growth environments: S. flexneri growing in broth (in vitro), S. flexneri growing within epithelial cell cytoplasm (intracellular), and S. flexneri that were cultured with, but did not invade, Henle cells (extracellular). Compared to in vitro and extracellular bacteria, intracellular bacteria had increased levels of proteins required for invasion and cell-to-cell spread, including Ipa, Mxi, and Ics proteins. Changes in metabolic pathways in response to the intracellular environment also were evident. There was an increase in glycogen biosynthesis enzymes, altered expression of sugar transporters, and a reduced amount of the carbon storage regulator CsrA. Mixed acid fermentation enzymes were highly expressed intracellularly, while tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidoreductive enzymes and most electron transport chain proteins, except CydAB, were markedly decreased. This suggested that fermentation and the CydAB system primarily sustain energy generation intracellularly. Elevated levels of PntAB, which is responsible for NADPH regeneration, suggested a shortage of reducing factors for ATP synthesis. These metabolic changes likely reflect changes in available carbon sources, oxygen levels, and iron availability. Intracellular bacteria showed strong evidence of iron starvation. Iron acquisition systems (Iut, Sit, FhuA, and Feo) and the iron starvation, stress-associated Fe-S cluster assembly (Suf) protein were markedly increased in abundance. Mutational analysis confirmed that the mixed-acid fermentation pathway was required for wild-type intracellular growth and spread of S. flexneri. Thus, iron stress and changes in carbon metabolism may be key factors in the S. flexneri transition from the extra- to the intracellular milieu.","['Pieper R', 'Fisher CR', 'Suh MJ', 'Huang ST', 'Parmar P', 'Payne SM']",2013,81,12,Infect Immun,"Pieper R, et al.

24090466,"Isolation, characterization and comparative genomics of bacteriophage SfIV: a novel serotype converting phage from Shigella flexneri.","BACKGROUND: Shigella flexneri is the major cause of shigellosis in the developing countries. The O-antigen component of the lipopolysaccharide is one of the key virulence determinants required for the pathogenesis of S. flexneri. The glucosyltransferase and/or acetyltransferase genes responsible for the modification of the O-antigen are encoded by temperate serotype converting bacteriophage present in the S. flexneri genome. Several serotype converting phages have previously been isolated and characterized, however, attempts to isolate a serotype converting phage which encodes the modification genes of serotypes 4a strain have not been successful.
RESULTS: In this study, a novel temperate serotype converting bacteriophage SfIV was isolated. Lysogenisation of phage SfIV converted serotype Y strain to serotype 4a. Electron microscopy indicated that SfIV belongs to Myoviridae family. The 39,758 bp genome of phage SfIV encompasses 54 open reading frames (orfs). Protein level comparison of SfIV with other serotype converting phages of S. flexneri revealed that SfIV is similar to phage SfII and SfV. The comparative analysis also revealed that SfIV phage contained five proteins which were not found in any other phages of S. flexneri. These proteins were: a tail fiber assembly protein, two hypothetical proteins with no clear function, and two other unknown proteins which were encoded by orfs present on a moron, that presumably got introduced in SfIV genome from another species via a transposon. These unique proteins of SfIV may play a role in the pathogenesis of the host.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the isolation and complete genome sequence analysis of bacteriophage SfIV. The SfIV phage has a host range significantly different from the other phages of Shigella. Comparative genome analysis identified several proteins unique to SfIV, which may potentially be involved in the survival and pathogenesis of its host. These findings will further our understanding on the evolution of these phages, and will also facilitate studies on development of new phage vectors and therapeutic agents to control infections caused by S. flexneri.","['Jakhetia R', 'Talukder KA', 'Verma NK']",2013,14,,BMC Genomics,"Jakhetia R, et al.

24086068,The inside story of Shigella invasion of intestinal epithelial cells.,"As opposed to other invasive pathogens that reside into host cells in a parasitic mode, Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, invades the colonic mucosa but does not penetrate further to survive into deeper tissues. Instead, Shigella invades, replicates, and disseminates within the colonic mucosa. Bacterial invasion and spreading in intestinal epithelium lead to the elicitation of inflammatory responses responsible for the tissue destruction and shedding in the environment for further infection of other hosts. In this article, we highlight specific features of the Shigella arsenal of virulence determinants injected by a type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) that point to the targeting of intestinal epithelial cells as a discrete route of invasion during the initial event of the infectious process.","['Carayol N', 'Tran Van Nhieu G']",2013,3,10,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,Carayol N and Tran Van Nhieu G.

Iran is one of the endemic areas of shigellosis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility and genetic relatedness of S. sonnei strains isolated from pediatric patients in Tehran, Iran.
METHODS: The study included all S. sonnei strains isolated from pediatric patients with diarrhea admitted to several hospitals in Tehran, Iran, during 2008-2010. Shigella spp. strains were recovered from patients using standard microbiological methods. S. sonnei strains were further studied by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) - PCR analysis.
RESULTS: Eighty nine Shigella isolates were isolated. S. sonnei was themost prevalent Shigella species (60.7%) followed by, S. flexneri (31.5%). Eleven antimicrobial resistance patterns (R1-R11) were identified among S. sonnei isolates. The majority of the strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and streptomycin. All isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ceftizoxime and chloramphenicol. All strains were typable by ERIC-PCR. Five ERIC-PCR patterns (E1-E5) were found among S. sonnei isolates; however the half of the isolates was clustered in E4 pattern.
CONCLUSION: The antibiotic resistance rates are increasing among S. sonnei strains.

We previously demonstrated that the type three secretion apparatus (T3SA) proteins IpaB and IpaD are protective antigens in the mouse lethal pulmonary model. In order to simplify vaccine formulation and process development, we have evaluated a vaccine design that incorporates both of these previously tested Shigella antigens into a single polypeptide chain. To determine if this fusion protein (DB fusion) retains the antigenic and protective capacities of IpaB and IpaD, we immunized mice with the DB fusion and compared the immune response to that elicited by the IpaB/IpaD combination vaccine. Purification of the DB fusion required coexpression with IpgC, the IpaB chaperone, and after purification it maintained the highly α-helical characteristics of IpaB and IpaD. The DB fusion also induced comparable immune responses and retained the ability to protect mice against Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei in the lethal pulmonary challenge. It also offered limited protection against S. dysenteriae challenge. Our results show the feasibility of generating a protective Shigella vaccine comprised of the DB fusion.","['Martinez-Becerra FJ', 'Chen X', 'Dickenson NE', 'Choudhari SP', 'Harrison K', 'Clements JD', 'Picking WD', 'Van De Verg LL', 'Walker RI', 'Picking WL']",2013,81,12,Infect Immun,"Martinez-Becerra FJ, et al.

24060206,"Evaluation of underreporting of salmonellosis and shigellosis hospitalised cases in Greece, 2011: results of a capture-recapture study and a hospital registry review.","BACKGROUND: Salmonellosis and shigellosis are mandatorily notifiable diseases in Greece. Underreporting of both diseases has been postulated but there has not been any national study to quantify it. The objective of this study was to: a) estimate underreporting of hospitalised cases at public Greek hospitals in 2011 with a capture-recapture (C-RC) study, b) evaluate the accuracy of this estimation, c) investigate the possible impact of specific factors on notification rates, and d) estimate community incidence of both diseases.
METHODS: The mandatory notification system database and the database of the National Reference Laboratory for Salmonella and Shigella (NRLSS) were used in the C-RC study. The estimated total number of cases was compared with the actual number found by using the hospital records of the microbiological laboratories. Underreporting was also estimated by patients' age-group, sex, type of hospital, region and month of notification. Assessment of the community incidence was based on the extrapolation of the hospitalisation rate of the diseases in Europe.
RESULTS: The estimated underreporting of salmonellosis and shigellosis cases through the C-RC study was 47.7% and 52.0%, respectively. The reporting rate of salmonellosis significantly varied between the thirteen regions of the country from 8.3% to 95.6% (median: 28.4%). Age and sex were not related to the probability of reporting. The notification rate did not significantly differ between urban and rural areas, however, large university hospitals had a higher underreporting rate than district hospitals (p-value < 0.001). The actual underreporting, based on the hospital records review, was close to the estimated via the C-RC study; 52.8% for salmonellosis and 58.4% for shigellosis. The predicted community incidence of salmonellosis ranged from 312 to 936 and of shigellosis from 35 to 104 cases per 100,000 population.
CONCLUSIONS: Underreporting was higher than that reported by other countries and factors associated with underreporting should be further explored. C-RC analysis seems to be a useful tool for the assessment of the underreporting of hospitalised cases. National data on underreporting and under-ascertainment rate are needed for assessing the accuracy of the estimation of the community burden of the diseases.","['Mellou K', 'Sideroglou T', 'Kallimani A', 'Potamiti-Komi M', 'Pervanidou D', 'Lillakou E', 'Georgakopoulou T', 'Mandilara G', 'Lambiri M', 'Vatopoulos A', 'Hadjichristodoulou C']",2013,13,,BMC Public Health,"Mellou K, et al.

24040720,Shigellosis in Poland in 2011.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis, also known as bacillary dysentery, is a contagious and infectious disease. In the European Union, on the basis of the Commission Decision of 2 April 2009 and the Commission Decision of 28 April 2008, a unified system for collecting epidemiological data on infectious diseases was introduced, including shigellosis. This makes it possible to compare data collected at different times and in different countries.
AIM: The aim of the article is to evaluate the epidemiological situation of shigellosis in Poland in 2011.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An assessment of the epidemiological situation of shigellosis was based on the results from an analysis of the yearly annual bulletins: ""Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2011"", reports from bacteriological laboratories and reports from individual cases and epidemiological investigations of outbreaks linked to shigellosis, sent by Sanitary Epidemiological Stations to the Department of Epidemiology at NIZP-PZH.
RESULTS: In Poland, 17 confirmed cases of shigellosis were registered in 2011. The incidence of 0.04 per 100,000 inhabitants was lower when compared to the previous year. The number of cases is lower by 48% when compared with the median of years 2005-2009--35 cases (incidence 0.09/100,000). Most of the cases were registered in the Silesian province--7 (incidence 0.15 /100,000). According to data from 16 laboratories of Sanitary Epidemiological Stations, Shigella was not detected among the subjects. All cases of shigellosis registered in 2011, were confirmed by a hospital laboratory at or a private laboratory.
CONCLUSIONS: In Poland, we have observed a decline in the number of cases of shigellosis and the incidence remains at a relatively steady level and constitutes less than 0.1/100,000 inhabitants. Compared to the rest of the countries belonging to the EU/EFTA, the current epidemiological situation of shigellosis in Poland is good. Poland is a country with the lowest incidence. In spite of this, the surveillance of shigellosis required more active epidemiological measures. Special attention should be paid to the bacteriological testing of people living in rural areas, children and young people.","['Stypułkowska-Misiurewicz H', 'Baumann-Popczyk A']",2013,67,2,Przegl Epidemiol,"Stypułkowska-Misiurewicz H and Baumann-Popczyk A.

24039575,The zebrafish as a new model for the in vivo study of Shigella flexneri interaction with phagocytes and bacterial autophagy.,"Autophagy, an ancient and highly conserved intracellular degradation process, is viewed as a critical component of innate immunity because of its ability to deliver cytosolic bacteria to the lysosome. However, the role of bacterial autophagy in vivo remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a vertebrate model for the study of infections because it is optically accessible at the larval stages when the innate immune system is already functional. Here, we have characterized the susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to Shigella flexneri, a paradigm for bacterial autophagy, and have used this model to study Shigella-phagocyte interactions in vivo. Depending on the dose, S. flexneri injected in zebrafish larvae were either cleared in a few days or resulted in a progressive and ultimately fatal infection. Using high resolution live imaging, we found that S. flexneri were rapidly engulfed by macrophages and neutrophils; moreover we discovered a scavenger role for neutrophils in eliminating infected dead macrophages and non-immune cell types that failed to control Shigella infection. We observed that intracellular S. flexneri could escape to the cytosol, induce septin caging and be targeted to autophagy in vivo. Depletion of p62 (sequestosome 1 or SQSTM1), an adaptor protein critical for bacterial autophagy in vitro, significantly increased bacterial burden and host susceptibility to infection. These results show the zebrafish larva as a new model for the study of S. flexneri interaction with phagocytes, and the manipulation of autophagy for anti-bacterial therapy in vivo.","['Mostowy S', 'Boucontet L', 'Mazon Moya MJ', 'Sirianni A', 'Boudinot P', 'Hollinshead M', 'Cossart P', 'Herbomel P', 'Levraud JP', 'Colucci-Guyon E']",2013,9,9,PLoS Pathog,"Mostowy S, et al.

A monovalent or hexavalent mixture containing 1 × 10(7) of each serogroup/serotype of heat-killed Shigella cells was administered orally on Days 0, 7, 14 and 21. On Day 28, the immunized animals were challenged rectally with 1 × 10(9) live virulent cells of each of the six Shigella serogroups/serotypes. In all immunized groups, significant levels of protection were observed after these challenges. The serum titers of IgG and IgA against the lipopolysaccharide of each of the six Shigella serogroups/serotypes increased exponential during the course of immunization. High IgA titers against the lipopolysaccharide of each of the six Shigella serogroups/serotypes were also observed in intestinal lavage fluid from all immunized animals. These data indicate that a hexavalent mixture of heat-killed cells of the six Shigella serogroups/serotypes studied would be a possible broad-spectrum candidate vaccine against shigellosis.","['Barman S', 'Koley H', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Chakrabarti MK', 'Shinoda S', 'Nair GB', 'Takeda Y']",2013,57,11,Microbiol Immunol,"Barman S, et al.

24028603,Review of the safety and efficacy of vitamin A supplementation in the treatment of children with severe acute malnutrition.,"BACKGROUND: World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend for children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), high-dose vitamin A (VA) supplements be given on day 1 of admission, and on days 2 and 14 in the case of clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Daily low-dose VA follows, delivered in a premix added to F-75 and F-100. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence for safety and effectiveness of high-dose VA supplementation (VAS) in treatment of children with SAM.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was undertaken for all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies from 1950 to 2012. Studies identified for full review were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology using a set of pre-defined criteria: indirectness; inconsistency; imprecision; and study limitations. A quality rating of high, moderate, or low was then assigned to each study, and only those attaining moderate to high were considered in making recommendations.
RESULTS: Of the 2072 abstracts screened, 38 met criteria for full review, and 20 were rated moderate to high quality. Only one study replicated the WHO VA protocol in children with SAM. Indirectness was a critical limitation, as studies were not exclusive to children with SAM. There was inconsistency across trials for definitions of malnutrition, morbidities, and ages studied; and imprecision arising from sub-group analyses and small sample sizes. Evidence showed improved outcomes associated with low-dose compared to high-dose VAS, except in cases presenting with signs of VAD, measles, and severe diarrhea or shigellosis. Adverse outcomes related to respiratory infection, diarrhea, and growth were associated with high-dose VAS in children who were predominantly adequately nourished. No adverse effects of the high dose were found in children with SAM in the trial that replicated the WHO VA guideline.
CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic review of the safety and efficacy of high-dose VAS in treatment of SAM. We recommend a low-dose VAS regimen for children with SAM, except in cases presenting with measles, severe diarrhea (shigellosis), and any indication of VAD. Further research is needed in exclusively malnourished children and to explore alternate delivery strategies.","['Iannotti LL', 'Trehan I', 'Manary MJ']",2013,12,,Nutr J,"Iannotti LL, et al.

24028276,Evaluation of an intragastric challenge model for Shigella dysenteriae 1 in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) for the pre-clinical assessment of Shigella vaccine formulations.,"Shigellosis is a worldwide disease, characterized by abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and the passage of blood- and mucus-streaked stools. Rhesus monkeys and other primates are the only animals that are naturally susceptible to shigellosis. A suitable animal model is required for the pre-clinical evaluation of vaccines candidates. In this study, the minimal dose of Shigella dysenteriae1 1617 strain required to produce dysentery in four of five (80% attack rate) monkeys using an escalating dose range for three groups [2 × 10(8) , 2 × 10(9) and 2 × 10(10) colony forming unit (CFU)] was determined. In addition, the monkeys were re-infected. The identified optimal challenge dose was 2 × 10(9) CFU; this dose elicited 60% protection in monkeys when they were re-challenged with a one log higher dose (2 × 10(10) CFU). The challenge dose, 2 × 10(10) CFU, produced severe dysentery in all monkeys, with one monkey dying within 24 h, elicited 100% protection when re-challenged with the same dose. All monkeys exhibited immune responses. This study concludes that the rhesus monkey model closely mimics the disease and immune response seen in humans and is a suitable animal model for the pre-clinical evaluation of Shigella vaccine candidates. Prior infection with the 1617 strain can protect monkeys against subsequent re-challenges with homologous strains.","['Islam D', 'Ruamsap N', 'Khantapura P', 'Aksomboon A', 'Srijan A', 'Wongstitwilairoong B', 'Bodhidatta L', 'Gettayacamin M', 'Venkatesan MM', 'Mason CJ']",2014,122,6,APMIS,"Islam D, et al.

24016414,Treatment with phenylbutyrate in a pre-clinical trial reduces diarrhea due to enteropathogenic Escherichia coli: link to cathelicidin induction.,"Treatment of shigellosis in rabbits with phenylbutyrate reduces clinical severity and counteracts down-regulation of cathelicidin (CAP-18) in the large intestinal epithelia. We aimed to further evaluate whether in a rabbit model of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) diarrhea, CAP-18 is down-regulated in the small intestine and if oral phenylbutyrate treatment affects CAP-18 expression, clinical recovery, shedding of EPEC in stool and virulence properties of the isolated colonies. EPEC-induced diarrhea down-regulated CAP-18 in the small intestinal epithelia as revealed by immunohistochemistry. Phenylbutyrate treatment reduced clinical illness, improved histological features of inflammation and up-regulated CAP-18 in the epithelia. Active CAP-18 peptide was also released in the stool as noted in Western blot analysis. Multiplex PCR analysis of total bacterial DNA in the stool showed absence of EPEC specific genes eae and bfpA. Treated rabbits shed rough strains still harboring eae and bfpA genes, which were less potent in binding to HeLa cells and induced delayed onset of diarrhea in new rabbits. In conclusion, EPEC-mediated down-regulation of CAP-18 in the small intestinal epithelia was restored by phenylbutyrate treatment. Upregulation of CAP-18 in the epithelia was accompanied by healing of the epithelial lining, reduced shedding and virulence of EPEC and recovery from diarrhea.","['Al-Mamun A', 'Mily A', 'Sarker P', 'Tiash S', 'Navarro A', 'Akter M', 'Talukder KA', 'Islam MF', 'Agerberth B', 'Gudmundsson GH', 'Cravioto A', 'Raqib R']",2013,15,13,Microbes Infect,"Al-Mamun A, et al.

24012542,Characterization and complete genome sequence of the Shigella bacteriophage pSf-1.,"Shigellosis is a global health problem, and Shigella flexneri is the major cause of this disease. In this study, we isolated a virulent Siphoviridae bacteriophage (phage), pSf-1, that infects S. flexneri. This phage was isolated from the Han River in Korea and was found to infect S. flexneri, Shigella boydii, and Shigella sonnei. One-step growth analysis revealed that this phage has a short latent period (10 min) and a large burst size (86.86 PFU/cell), indicating that pSf-1 has good host infectivity and effective lytic activity. The double-stranded DNA genome of pSf-1 is composed of 51,821 bp with a G + C content of 44.02%. The genome encodes 94 putative ORFs, 71 putative promoters, and 60 transcriptional terminator regions. Genome sequence analysis of pSf-1 and comparative analysis with the homologous Shigella phage Shfl1 revealed that there is a high degree of similarity between pSf-1 and Shfl1 in 54 of the 94 ORFs of pSf-1. The results of this investigation indicate that pSf-1 is a novel Shigella phage and that this phage might have potential uses against shigellosis.","['Jun JW', 'Kim JH', 'Shin SP', 'Han JE', 'Chai JY', 'Park SC']",2013,164,10,Res Microbiol,"Jun JW, et al.

24008913,Dynamics of shigellosis epidemics: estimating individual-level transmission and reporting rates from national epidemiologic data sets.,"Shigellosis, a diarrheal disease, is endemic worldwide and is responsible for approximately 15,000 laboratory-confirmed cases in the United States every year. However, patients with shigellosis often do not seek medical care. To estimate the burden of shigellosis, we extended time-series susceptible-infected-recovered models to infer epidemiologic parameters from underreported case data. We applied the time-series susceptible-infected-recovered-based inference schemes to analyze the largest surveillance data set of Shigella sonnei in the United States from 1967 to 2007 with county-level resolution. The dynamics of shigellosis transmission show strong annual and multiyear cycles, as well as seasonality. By using the schemes, we inferred individual-level parameters of shigellosis infection, including seasonal transmissibilities and basic reproductive number (R0). In addition, this study provides quantitative estimates of the reporting rate, suggesting that the shigellosis burden in the United States may be more than 10 times the number of laboratory-confirmed cases. Although the estimated reporting rate is generally under 20%, and R0 is generally under 1.5, there is a strong negative correlation between estimates of the reporting rate and R0. Such negative correlations are likely to pose identifiability problems in underreported diseases. We discuss complementary approaches that might further disentangle the true reporting rate and R0.","['Joh RI', 'Hoekstra RM', 'Barzilay EJ', 'Bowen A', 'Mintz ED', 'Weiss H', 'Weitz JS']",2013,178,8,Am J Epidemiol,"Joh RI, et al.

23999303,High-affinity inhibitors of Zymomonas mobilis tRNA-guanine transglycosylase through convergent optimization.,"The tRNA-modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) has been recognized as a drug target for the treatment of the foodborne illness shigellosis. The active site of TGT consists of three pockets: the central guanine/preQ1 recognition site and the ribose-33 and ribose-34 pockets. In previous work, lin-benzoguanines and lin-benzohypoxanthines, which differ by the presence of an exocyclic NH2 group in the former and its absence in the latter, were used as central scaffolds that bind to the guanine/preQ1 recognition site and allow suitable functionalization along exit vectors targeting the two ribose pockets. The substituents for both of these two pockets have been optimized individually. Here, a series of bifunctionalized inhibitors that occupy both ribose pockets are reported for the first time. Dissociation constants Kd down to the picomolar range were measured for the bifunctionalized lin-benzoguanine-based ligands and Kd values in the nanomolar range were measured for the corresponding lin-benzohypoxanthine-based ligands. The binding mode of all inhibitors was elucidated by X-ray crystal structure analysis. A remarkable influence of the crystallization protocol on the solvation pattern in the solid state and the residual mobility of the bound ligands was observed.","['Barandun LJ', 'Immekus F', 'Kohler PC', 'Ritschel T', 'Heine A', 'Orlando P', 'Klebe G', 'Diederich F']",2013,69,Pt 9,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,"Barandun LJ, et al.

23974914,[Drug therapy of infectious diarrhea: part 1: acute diarrhea].,"BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is one of the most commonly occurring diseases.
AIM: This article gives a review of the current state of the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea (part 1) and chronic infectious diarrhea (part 2) as well as of the most important pathogens.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following a presentation of the general principles of the therapy of diarrhea, the targeted antimicrobial therapy of the most important bacterial gastrointestinal infections is described. This includes salmonellosis, shigellosis and Campylobacter infections, infections with pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, yersiniosis and cholera. Due to the increasing incidence and changes in the severity of the disease and important new aspects in the treatment of diarrhea caused by toxigenic Clostridium difficile strains, these disease entities will be described in detail.
RESULTS: Symptomatic therapy is still the most important aspect of the treatment of infectious diarrhea. For severely ill patients with a high frequency of stools (> 8/day), immunodeficiency, advanced age or significant comorbidities, empirical antibiotic therapy should be considered. Increasing resistance, in particular against fluoroquinolones must also be taken into consideration. Due to the risk of excessive pathogen proliferation and concomitant intestinal toxin production with protracted or multiple complications during the disease, therapy with motility inhibitors is not recommended. With respect to the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections a promising novel aspect arose in 2012. The macrocyclic antibiotic fidaxomycin can reduce the rate of recurrent disease with the same effectiveness as vancomycin. Furthermore, evidence for the benefits of allogenic stool transplantation is increasing.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of acute diarrhea is still primarily supportive. The benefits of general empirical antibiotic therapy for acute diarrhea are not evidence-based.","['Lübbert C', 'Weis S']",2013,54,11,Internist (Berl),Lübbert C and Weis S.

The retrospective analysis of clinical and endoscopic manifestations, and histopathological characteristics, were conducted for 96 patients with intestinal schistosomiasis. Among these patients, 21 lived in areas that were not infected with Schistosoma and 25 (26%) had no history of schistosome infection or contact with infected water. These patients were mainly hospitalized due to symptoms of diarrhea, mucus and bloody purulent stool. Sixteen cases were of the acute enteritis type, and colonoscopy results determined hyperaemic edema and dispersed small mucosal ulcers. The acute infection in patients was pathologically characterized by the deposition of intact ova with a large quantity of eosinocyte infiltration. Forty‑one cases were of the chronic enteritis type which predominantly manifested with yellow nodules and disorder of the vascular surfaces in the intestines. Thirty‑nine cases were diagnosed with mixed type enteritis, which demonstrated acute and chronic histopathological appearances. In addition, six cases of complicated colorectal cancer were observed. Of the 24 misdiagnosed patients, eight were misdiagnosed with ulcerative colitis, five with colorectal cancer, five with colorectal tuberculosis, four with chronic bacillary dysentery and two with irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal schistosomiasis demonstrated no specific clinical or endoscopic manifestations and it was determined that patients with abdominal pain, diarrhea and mucous stool may be infected with intestinal schistosomiasis. Epidemiological investigations and colonoscopy combined with multi‑block and multi‑site biopsies may improve the diagnosis of intestinal schistosomiasis. In addition, it is necessary for intestinal schistosomiasis to be followed up by colonoscopy, due to its possible correlation with colorectal tumors.","['Ye C', 'Tan S', 'Jiang L', 'Li M', 'Sun P', 'Shen L', 'Luo H']",2013,8,4,Mol Med Rep,"Ye C, et al.

Fifteen sets of highly validated primers were chosen to amplify target genes simultaneously. Corresponding oligonucleotide probes directly conjugated with microsphere sets were used to specifically identify PCR amplicons. Sensitivity tests revealed that the array coupled with single PCR was able to detect purified genomic DNA at concentrations as low as 10 copies/μL, while the multiplex detection limit was 10-10⁴ copies/μL. The assay was validated using water samples artificially spiked with S. aureus and S. dysenteriae, as well as water specimens from swimming pools previously identified to contain S. aureus.","['Zhao J', 'Kang L', 'Hu R', 'Gao S', 'Xin W', 'Chen W', 'Wang J']",2013,10,10,Foodborne Pathog Dis,"Zhao J, et al.

23935901,Using complete genome comparisons to identify sequences whose presence accurately predicts clinically important phenotypes.,"In clinical settings it is often important to know not just the identity of a microorganism, but also the danger posed by that particular strain. For instance, Escherichia coli can range from being a harmless commensal to being a very dangerous enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) strain. Determining pathogenic phenotypes can be both time consuming and expensive. Here we propose a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method of predicting pathogenic phenotypes on the basis of the presence or absence of short homologous DNA segments in an isolate. Our method compares completely sequenced genomes without the necessity of genome alignments in order to identify the presence or absence of the segments to produce an automatic alignment of the binary string that describes each genome. Analysis of the segment alignment allows identification of those segments whose presence strongly predicts a phenotype. Clinical application of the method requires nothing more that PCR amplification of each of the set of predictive segments. Here we apply the method to identifying EHEC strains of E. coli and to distinguishing E. coli from Shigella. We show in silico that with as few as 8 predictive sequences, if even three of those predictive sequences are amplified the probability of being EHEC or Shigella is >0.99. The method is thus very robust to the occasional amplification failure for spurious reasons. Experimentally, we apply the method to screening a set of 98 isolates to distinguishing E. coli from Shigella, and EHEC from non-EHEC E. coli strains and show that all isolates are correctly identified.","['Hall BG', 'Cardenas H', 'Barlow M']",2013,8,7,PLoS One,"Hall BG, et al.

23904297,A mouse model of shigellosis by intraperitoneal infection.,"In human and nonhuman primates, Shigella spp. cause bacillary dysentery by invading colon epithelium and promoting a strong inflammatory response; however, adult mice are resistant to oral Shigella infection. In this study, intraperitoneal challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2a (YSH6000) resulted in diarrhea and severe body weight loss in adult B6 mice. Of note, virulent S. flexneri 2a could invade and colonize not only systemic tissues but also the serosa and lamina propria region of the large intestine. In addition, epithelial shedding, barrier integrity, and goblet cell hyperplasia were found in the large intestine by 24 hours post-intraperitoneal Shigella infection. Of note, predominant expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were found in the large intestine after intraperitoneal challenge. Monocytes played a critical role in attenuating diarrhea and in providing protective efficacy against intraperitoneal Shigella infection. Most importantly, mice prevaccinated with attenuated S. flexneri 2a (SC602) strain were protected against intraperitoneal challenge with YSH6000. When taken together, these findings show that intraperitoneal challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2a can provoke bacillary dysentery and severe pathogenesis in adult mice. This model may be helpful for understanding the induction mechanism of bacillary dysentery and for evaluating Shigella vaccine candidates.","['Yang JY', 'Lee SN', 'Chang SY', 'Ko HJ', 'Ryu S', 'Kweon MN']",2014,209,2,J Infect Dis,"Yang JY, et al.

23886737,Antimicrobial resistance in Shigella spp. causing traveller's diarrhoea (1995-2010): a retrospective analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is a global human health problem causing an important morbidity among travellers returning from tropical areas. This study was aimed to describe the evolution of antimicrobial resistance profile in Shigella spp. isolated between the years 1995-2010 in patients with traveller's diarrhoea (TD) returning from tropical areas.
METHODS: The levels of antimicrobial resistance were tested in a total of 191 Shigella spp. isolated during the period from 1995 to 2010.
RESULTS: A decrease of cases of diarrhoea caused by Shigella has been observed in recent years. A wide spectrum of antibiotic resistance was observed among Shigella spp. These isolates showed high levels of resistance to tetracycline (84%), co-trimoxazole (75.5%), and ampicillin (45.5%). The resistance was low to ciprofloxacin (2.1%), azithromycin (3.9%) and furazolidone (8.4%). According to the period, in the case of ampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, values of resistance were significantly decreasing from 1995-2000 to 2001-2010, (62.5% vs. 28.4%, 19.8% vs. 6.6%, 23.4 vs. 10.4%, respectively). Meanwhile in nalidixic acid and tetracycline the evolution of resistance has increased over time.
CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the isolation number of Shigella spp. causing TD has been observed. Differential trends in the evolution of the levels of resistance to the tested antibacterial agents have been observed.","['Pons MJ', 'Gomes C', 'Martínez-Puchol S', 'Ruiz L', 'Mensa L', 'Vila J', 'Gascón J', 'Ruiz J']",2013,11,5,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Pons MJ, et al.

23876800,"Virulent Shigella flexneri affects secretion, expression, and glycosylation of gel-forming mucins in mucus-producing cells.","Mucin glycoproteins are secreted in large amounts by the intestinal epithelium and constitute an efficient component of innate immune defenses to promote homeostasis and protect against enteric pathogens. In this study, our objective was to investigate how the bacterial enteropathogen Shigella flexneri, which causes bacillary dysentery, copes with the mucin defense barrier. We report that upon in vitro infection of mucin-producing polarized human intestinal epithelial cells, virulent S. flexneri manipulates the secretion of gel-forming mucins. This phenomenon, which is triggered only by virulent strains, results in accumulation of mucins at the cell apical surface, leading to the appearance of a gel-like structure that favors access of bacteria to the cell surface and the subsequent invasion process. We identify MUC5AC, a gel-forming mucin, as a component of this structure. Formation of this gel does not depend on modifications of electrolyte concentrations, induction of trefoil factor expression, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or response to unfolded proteins. In addition, transcriptional and biochemical analyses of infected cells reveal modulations of mucin gene expression and modifications of mucin glycosylation patterns, both of which are induced by virulent bacteria in a type III secretion system-dependent manner. Thus, S. flexneri has developed a dedicated strategy to alter the mucus barrier by targeting key elements of the gel-forming capacity of mucins: gene transcription, protein glycosylation, and secretion.","['Sperandio B', 'Fischer N', 'Joncquel Chevalier-Curt M', 'Rossez Y', 'Roux P', 'Robbe Masselot C', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2013,81,10,Infect Immun,"Sperandio B, et al.

23852945,High rates of quinolone-resistant strains of Shigella sonnei in HIV-infected MSM.,"PURPOSE: There is increasing evidence that shigellosis is a predominantly sexually transmitted disease among men who have sex with men (MSM) and that infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a risk factor for shigellosis.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of antibiotic resistance profiles of Shigella species isolated from stool specimens of patients presenting with diarrhea from January 2010 to July 2012 in three German outpatient clinics specialized in HIV care.
RESULTS: Among 79 cases of Shigella sonnei, 56 occurred in HIV-infected MSM, while 23 were observed in HIV-negative MSM. High resistance rates (>90%) were found for doxycycline, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, all cephalosporins of first and second generations tested, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In total, 54% of cases were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Compared to negative subjects, HIV-infected MSM had a significantly higher rate of quinolone resistance. For ciprofloxacin, the resistance rates were 66 versus 24%, respectively (p = 0.0016). Individual resistance patterns did not indicate that this was due to a limited outbreak. Rates of resistance to other antibiotics than quinolones showed no differences between HIV-infected and HIV-negative cases. No resistance was found for carbapenems or newer cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone.
CONCLUSIONS: The high rates of S. sonnei isolates resistant to quinolones and other traditional antibiotics are of concern. Innovative prevention efforts are urgently needed. The empirical use of quinolones in HIV-infected patients presenting with S. sonnei infection is no longer recommended.","['Hoffmann C', 'Sahly H', 'Jessen A', 'Ingiliz P', 'Stellbrink HJ', 'Neifer S', 'Schewe K', 'Dupke S', 'Baumgarten A', 'Kuschel A', 'Krznaric I']",2013,41,5,Infection,"Hoffmann C, et al.

23847617,Self-adjuvanting bacterial vectors expressing pre-erythrocytic antigens induce sterile protection against malaria.,"Genetically inactivated, Gram-negative bacteria that express malaria vaccine candidates represent a promising novel self-adjuvanting vaccine approach. Antigens expressed on particulate bacterial carriers not only target directly to antigen-presenting cells but also provide a strong danger signal thus circumventing the requirement for potent extraneous adjuvants. E. coli expressing malarial antigens resulted in the induction of either Th1 or Th2 biased responses that were dependent on both antigen and sub-cellular localization. Some of these constructs induced higher quality humoral responses compared to recombinant protein and most importantly they were able to induce sterile protection against sporozoite challenge in a murine model of malaria. In light of these encouraging results, two major Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine targets, the Cell-Traversal protein for Ookinetes and Sporozoites (CelTOS) fused to the Maltose-binding protein in the periplasmic space and the Circumsporozoite Protein (CSP) fused to the Outer membrane (OM) protein A in the OM were expressed in a clinically relevant, attenuated Shigella strain (Shigella flexneri 2a). This type of live-attenuated vector has previously undergone clinical investigations as a vaccine against shigellosis. Using this novel delivery platform for malaria, we find that vaccination with the whole-organism represents an effective vaccination alternative that induces protective efficacy against sporozoite challenge. Shigella GeMI-Vax expressing malaria targets warrant further evaluation to determine their full potential as a dual disease, multivalent, self-adjuvanting vaccine system, against both shigellosis, and malaria.","['Bergmann-Leitner ES', 'Hosie H', 'Trichilo J', 'Deriso E', 'Ranallo RT', 'Alefantis T', 'Savranskaya T', 'Grewal P', 'Ockenhouse CF', 'Venkatesan MM', 'Delvecchio VG', 'Angov E']",2013,4,,Front Immunol,"Bergmann-Leitner ES, et al.

23825726,"The occurrence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Shigella spp. in Tehran, Iran.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Shigella spp. is of increasing clinical concern specially in children worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Shigella spp. in Tehran, Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included all Shigella isolates recovered from pediatric patients aged less than 12 years admitted to a major pediatric hospital in Tehran, Iran, from 2008 to 2010. Bacterial identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) screening and confirmatory tests were performed according to the standard guidelines. Conjugal transfer experiments and plasmid analysis were also carried out. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were used to identify the genetic determinants responsible for ESBL production.
RESULTS: Four out of 55 Shigella isolates, including three S. sonnei and one S. flexneri, showed an ESBL-positive phenotype. Plasmid transfer of the ESBL phenotype was successful for the S. flexneri isolate only. By PCR and sequencing, one S. sonnei isolate tested positive for the CMY-59 gene, while the other two S. sonnei and the S. flexneri isolates tested positive for the bla TEM-1 and bla CTX-M-15 genes.
CONCLUSION: We found the prevalence of ESBL producing Shigella isolates was higher than detection rates observed in many other countries. Our finding raise concerns about the dissemination of ESBL among the strains of endemic S. sonnei throughout the country, because this species is now the most frequently isolated Shigella species in Iran and shigellosis by such strains in the community can pose a significant threat to patients and presents a challenge for disease management.","['Ranjbar R', 'Ghazi FM', 'Farshad S', 'Giammanco GM', 'Aleo A', 'Owlia P', 'Jonaidi N', 'Sadeghifard N', 'Mammina C']",2013,5,2,Iran J Microbiol,"Ranjbar R, et al.

23818998,"Housefly population density correlates with shigellosis among children in Mirzapur, Bangladesh: a time series analysis.","BACKGROUND: Shigella infections are a public health problem in developing and transitional countries because of high transmissibility, severity of clinical disease, widespread antibiotic resistance and lack of a licensed vaccine. Whereas Shigellae are known to be transmitted primarily by direct fecal-oral contact and less commonly by contaminated food and water, the role of the housefly Musca domestica as a mechanical vector of transmission is less appreciated. We sought to assess the contribution of houseflies to Shigella-associated moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children less than five years old in Mirzapur, Bangladesh, a site where shigellosis is hyperendemic, and to model the potential impact of a housefly control intervention.
METHODS: Stool samples from 843 children presenting to Kumudini Hospital during 2009-2010 with new episodes of MSD (diarrhea accompanied by dehydration, dysentery or hospitalization) were analyzed. Housefly density was measured twice weekly in six randomly selected sentinel households. Poisson time series regression was performed and autoregression-adjusted attributable fractions (AFs) were calculated using the Bruzzi method, with standard errors via jackknife procedure.
FINDINGS: Dramatic springtime peaks in housefly density in 2009 and 2010 were followed one to two months later by peaks of Shigella-associated MSD among toddlers and pre-school children. Poisson time series regression showed that housefly density was associated with Shigella cases at three lags (six weeks) (Incidence Rate Ratio = 1.39 [95% CI: 1.23 to 1.58] for each log increase in fly count), an association that was not confounded by ambient air temperature. Autocorrelation-adjusted AF calculations showed that a housefly control intervention could have prevented approximately 37% of the Shigella cases over the study period.
INTERPRETATION: Houseflies may play an important role in the seasonal transmission of Shigella in some developing country ecologies. Interventions to control houseflies should be evaluated as possible additions to the public health arsenal to diminish Shigella (and perhaps other causes of) diarrheal infection.","['Farag TH', 'Faruque AS', 'Wu Y', 'Das SK', 'Hossain A', 'Ahmed S', 'Ahmed D', 'Nasrin D', 'Kotloff KL', 'Panchilangam S', 'Nataro JP', 'Cohen D', 'Blackwelder WC', 'Levine MM']",2013,7,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Farag TH, et al.

Moreover, 168 (57.3%) of the isolates contained only the gyrA (Ser83Leu) mutation. In addition, 107 isolates had two gyrA point mutations (Ser83Leu and either Asp87Gly, Asp87Asn or Asp113Tyr) and 13 isolates had two gyrA point mutations (Ser83Leu and Asp87Gly or Gly214Ala) and one parC mutation (Ser80Ile).

23792688,Single cell measurements of vacuolar rupture caused by intracellular pathogens.,"Shigella flexneri are pathogenic bacteria that invade host cells entering into an endocytic vacuole. Subsequently, the rupture of this membrane-enclosed compartment allows bacteria to move within the cytosol, proliferate and further invade neighboring cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is phagocytosed by immune cells, and has recently been shown to rupture phagosomal membrane in macrophages. We developed a robust assay for tracking phagosomal membrane disruption after host cell entry of Shigella flexneri or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The approach makes use of CCF4, a FRET reporter sensitive to β-lactamase that equilibrates in the cytosol of host cells. Upon invasion of host cells by bacterial pathogens, the probe remains intact as long as the bacteria reside in membrane-enclosed compartments. After disruption of the vacuole, β-lactamase activity on the surface of the intracellular pathogen cleaves CCF4 instantly leading to a loss of FRET signal and switching its emission spectrum. This robust ratiometric assay yields accurate information about the timing of vacuolar rupture induced by the invading bacteria, and it can be coupled to automated microscopy and image processing by specialized algorithms for the detection of the emission signals of the FRET donor and acceptor. Further, it allows investigating the dynamics of vacuolar disruption elicited by intracellular bacteria in real time in single cells. Finally, it is perfectly suited for high-throughput analysis with a spatio-temporal resolution exceeding previous methods. Here, we provide the experimental details of exemplary protocols for the CCF4 vacuolar rupture assay on HeLa cells and THP-1 macrophages for time-lapse experiments or end points experiments using Shigella flexneri as well as multiple mycobacterial strains such as Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium bovis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","['Keller C', 'Mellouk N', 'Danckaert A', 'Simeone R', 'Brosch R', 'Enninga J', 'Bobard A']",2013,,76,J Vis Exp,"Keller C, et al.

23764536,Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) from Shigella flexneri 2a: a promising subunit vaccine candidate.,"Shigellosis is the leading cause of childhood mortality and morbidity. Despite many years of extensive research a practical vaccine is not yet available against the disease. Recent studies illustrate that bacterial outer membrane proteins are budding target as vaccine antigen. Outer membrane proteins A (OmpA) are among the most immunodominant antigens in the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and possess many characteristics desired of a vaccine candidate. We observe that OmpA of Shigella flexneri 2a is crossreactive and common antigen among Shigella spp. and the epitope is widely exposed on the cell surface as well as capable of evoking protective immunity in mice. The protective immunity involves participation of both the humoral and cellular immune responses, since OmpA boosts rapid induction of IgG and IgA in both the systemic and mucosal compartments and also activates Th1 cells. The immunopotentiating activity of OmpA is mediated by its ability to bind and stimulate macrophages and up-regulate the surface expression of MHCII, CD80 and CD40, leading to activation of CD4(+) T cells to secrete cytokines and express chemokine receptor and IL-12Rβ2, thereby orchestrating the bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses. This ability is dependent on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), as demonstrated by lack of response by TLR2 knockdown macrophages to OmpA. Hence this property of OmpA to link innate and adaptive immunity via TLR2 offers a novel vista to develop vaccine against shigellosis.","['Pore D', 'Chakrabarti MK']",2013,31,36,Vaccine,Pore D and Chakrabarti MK.

23761159,"Multiplex real-time PCR for detection of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella.","Infectious diarrhea can be classified based on its clinical presentation as noninflammatory or inflammatory disease. In developing countries, among inflammatory diarrhea cases, Shigella is the most common cause, followed by Campylobacter and Salmonella. Because the time frame in which treatment choices must be made is short and conventional stool cultures lack good sensitivity, there is a need for a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive detection technique. The purpose of our study was to develop a multiplex real-time PCR procedure to simultaneously identify Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Primers were designed to amplify the invA, ipaH, and 16S rRNA genes simultaneously in a single reaction to detect Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter, respectively. Using this approach, we correctly identified 102 of 103 strains of the targeted enteropathogens and 34 of 34 other pathogens. The melting temperatures were 82.96 ± 0.05 °C for invA, 85.56 ± 0.28 °C for ipaH, and 89.21 ± 0.24 °C for 16S rRNA. The limit of accurate quantification for the assay in stool samples was 10(4) CFU g(-1); however, the limit of detection was 10(3) CFU g(-1). This assay is a simple, rapid, inexpensive, and reliable system for the practical detection of these three enteropathogens in clinical specimens.","['Barletta F', 'Mercado EH', 'Lluque A', 'Ruiz J', 'Cleary TG', 'Ochoa TJ']",2013,51,9,J Clin Microbiol,"Barletta F, et al.

We examined the effect of immunization with an oral live-attenuated Shigella dysenteriae 1 vaccine and challenge with wild-type S. dysenteriae 1 on the fecal microbiota of cynomolgus macaques using 16 S rRNA analysis of fecal samples. Multi-dimensional cluster analysis identified different bacterial community types within macaques from geographically distinct locations. The fecal microbiota of Mauritian macaques, observed to be genetically distinct, harbored a high-diversity community and responded differently to Shigella immunization, as well as challenge compared to the microbiota in non-Mauritian macaques. While both macaque populations exhibited anti-Shigella antibody responses, clinical shigellosis was observed only among non-Mauritian macaques. These studies highlight the importance of further investigation into the possible protective role of the microbiota against enteric pathogens and consideration of host genetic backgrounds in conducting vaccine studies.","['Seekatz AM', 'Panda A', 'Rasko DA', 'Toapanta FR', 'Eloe-Fadrosh EA', 'Khan AQ', 'Liu Z', 'Shipley ST', 'Detolla LJ', 'Sztein MB', 'Fraser CM']",2013,8,6,PLoS One,"Seekatz AM, et al.

Therefore, many bacterial pathogens deploy multiple mechanisms to counteract NF-κB activation. The invasion of and subsequent replication of Shigella within epithelial cells is recognized by various pathogen recognition receptors as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These receptors trigger innate defense mechanisms via the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Here, we show the inhibition of the NF-κB activation by the delivery of the IpaH E3 ubiquitin ligase family member IpaH0722 using Shigella's type III secretion system. IpaH0722 dampens the acute inflammatory response by preferentially inhibiting the PKC-mediated activation of NF-κB by ubiquitinating TRAF2, a molecule downstream of PKC, and by promoting its proteasome-dependent degradation.","['Ashida H', 'Nakano H', 'Sasakawa C']",2013,9,6,PLoS Pathog,"Ashida H, et al.

23753632,Characterization of intracellular growth regulator icgR by utilizing transcriptomics to identify mediators of pathogenesis in Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella species Gram-negative bacteria which cause a diarrheal disease, known as shigellosis, by invading and destroying the colonic mucosa and inducing a robust inflammatory response. With no vaccine available, shigellosis annually kills over 600,000 children in developing countries. This study demonstrates the utility of combining high-throughput bioinformatic methods with in vitro and in vivo assays to provide new insights into pathogenesis. Comparisons of in vivo and in vitro gene expression identified genes associated with intracellular growth. Additional bioinformatics analyses identified genes that are present in S. flexneri isolates but not in the three other Shigella species. Comparison of these two analyses revealed nine genes that are differentially expressed during invasion and that are specific to S. flexneri. One gene, a DeoR family transcriptional regulator with decreased expression during invasion, was further characterized and is now designated icgR, for intracellular growth regulator. Deletion of icgR caused no difference in growth in vitro but resulted in increased intracellular replication in HCT-8 cells. Further in vitro and in vivo studies using high-throughput sequencing of RNA transcripts (RNA-seq) of an isogenic ΔicgR mutant identified 34 genes that were upregulated under both growth conditions. This combined informatics and functional approach has allowed the characterization of a gene and pathway previously unknown in Shigella pathogenesis and provides a framework for further identification of novel virulence factors and regulatory pathways.","['Morris CR', 'Grassel CL', 'Redman JC', 'Sahl JW', 'Barry EM', 'Rasko DA']",2013,81,9,Infect Immun,"Morris CR, et al.

23753631,Agglutinating secretory IgA preserves intestinal epithelial cell integrity during apical infection by Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri, by invading intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and inducing inflammatory responses of the colonic mucosa, causes bacillary dysentery. Although M cells overlying Peyer's patches are commonly considered the primary site of entry of S. flexneri, indirect evidence suggests that bacteria can also use IECs as a portal of entry to the lamina propria. Passive delivery of secretory IgA (SIgA), the major immunoglobulin secreted at mucosal surfaces, has been shown to protect rabbits from experimental shigellosis, but no information exists as to its molecular role in maintaining luminal epithelial integrity. We have established that the interaction of virulent S. flexneri with the apical pole of a model intestinal epithelium consisting of polarized Caco-2 cell monolayers resulted in the progressive disruption of the tight junction network and actin depolymerization, eventually resulting in cell death. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific agglutinating SIgAC5 monoclonal antibody (MAb), but not monomeric IgAC5 or IgGC20 MAbs of the same specificity, achieved protective functions through combined mechanisms, including limitation of the interaction between S. flexneri and epithelial cells, maintenance of the tight junction seal, preservation of the cell morphology, reduction of NF-κB nuclear translocation, and inhibition of proinflammatory mediator secretion. Our results add to the understanding of the function of SIgA-mediated immune exclusion by identifying a mode of action whereby the formation of immune complexes translates into maintenance of the integrity of epithelial cells lining the mucosa. This novel mechanism of protection mediated by SIgA is important to extend the arsenal of effective strategies to fight against S. flexneri mucosal invasion.","['Mathias A', 'Longet S', 'Corthésy B']",2013,81,8,Infect Immun,"Mathias A, et al.

Initially, the DNA sequence coding N-terminal region was isolated by PCR from Shigella dysenteriae type I and cloned into pET-28a expression vector. Then, the heterologous protein was expressed, optimized and purified by affinity Ni-NTA column. Western blot analysis using, His-tag and IpaD(72-162) polyclonal antibodies, confirmed the purity and specificity of the recombinant protein, respectively.

23727423,Nanoparticle-based vaccine for mucosal protection against Shigella flexneri in mice.,"Shigellosis is one of the leading causes of diarrhea worldwide with more than 130 million cases annually. Hence, the research of an effective vaccine is still a priority. Unfortunately, a safe and efficacious vaccine is not available yet. We have previously demonstrated the capacity of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to protect mice against an experimental infection with Shigella flexneri. Now, we present results on the capacity of this antigenic complex to confer a longer-term protection by oral or nasal routes when encapsulated into nanoparticles. OMVs were encapsulated in poly(anhydride) nanoparticles (NP) prepared by a solvent displacement method with the copolymer poly methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride. OMVs loaded into nanoparticles (NP-OMVs) were homogeneous and spherical in shape, with a size of 148nm (PdI=0.2). BALB/c mice were immunized with OMVs either free or encapsulated in nanoparticles by nasal (20μg or 10μg of OMVs) or oral route (100μg or 50μg of OMVs). All immunized animals remained in good health after administration. Challenge infection was performed intranasally on week 8th with a lethal dose of 5×10(7)CFU/mouse of S. flexneri 2a. The number of dead mice after challenge was recorded daily. Results confirmed the value of OMVs as a vaccine. By oral route, the OMV-vaccine was able to protect independently either the dose or the formulation. When vaccine was delivered by nasal route, encapsulation into NPs resulted beneficial in increasing protection from 40% up to 100% when low dose was administered. These results are extraordinary promising and put in relevance the positive effect of nanoencapsulation of the OMV subcellular vaccine.","['Camacho AI', 'Irache JM', 'de Souza J', 'Sánchez-Gómez S', 'Gamazo C']",2013,31,32,Vaccine,"Camacho AI, et al.

23707330,Vasorelaxant action of an ethylacetate fraction of Euphorbia humifusa involves NO-cGMP pathway and potassium channels.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Euphorbia humifusa Willd. (EH) is an important traditional Chinese medicine that has commonly been used for treating bacillary dysentery and enteritis in many Asian countries for thousands of years. EH has a wide variety of pharmacological actions such as antioxidant, hypotensive, and hypolipidemic effects. However, the mechanisms involved are to be defined.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was performed to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of EH in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol extract of EH (MEH) and ethylacetate fraction of the MEH (EEH) was examined for their vascular relaxant effects in phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings. Effects of EEH on systolic blood pressure and heart rate were tested in Sprague-Dawley rats.
RESULTS: MEH and EEH induced vasorelaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. Endothelium-denudation abolished the EEH-induced vasorelaxation. Pretreatment of the endothelium-intact aortic rings with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) and 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-[4,3-α]-quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) significantly inhibited the EEH-induced vasorelaxation. EEH increased cGMP levels of the aortic rings in a concentration-dependent manner and the effect was blocked by L-NAME or ODQ. Extracellular Ca(2+) depletion and treatments with thapsigargin, Gd(3+), and 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate significantly attenuated the EEH-induced vasorelaxation. Wortmannin markedly attenuated the EEH-induced vasorelaxation. In addition, tetraethylammonium, iberiotoxin, and charybdotoxin, but not apamin, attenuated the EEH-induced vasorelaxation. Glibenclamide, indomethacin, atropine, and propranolol had no effects on the EEH-induced vasorelaxation. Furthermore, EEH decreased systolic blood pressure and heart rate in a concentration-dependent manner in rats.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that EEH induces endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation via eNOS-NO-cGMP signaling through the modification of intracellular Ca(2+), Ca(2+) entry, and large- and intermediate-conductance KCa channel homeostasis. The data also suggest that the Akt-eNOS pathway is involved in the EEH-induced vasorelaxation. EEH induces hypotension and bradycardia in vivo.","['Wang TT', 'Zhou GH', 'Kho JH', 'Sun YY', 'Wen JF', 'Kang DG', 'Lee HS', 'Cho KW', 'Jin SN']",2013,148,2,J Ethnopharmacol,"Wang TT, et al.

23691156,Gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations of childhood shigellosis in a region where all four species of Shigella are endemic.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical manifestations and outcome of shigellosis among children infected with different species of Shigella.
METHODS: We identified all patients <15 years infected with Shigella admitted to the icddr, b Dhaka hospital during one year. Study staff reviewed admission records and repeated the physical examinations and history of patients daily.
RESULTS: Of 792 children with shigellosis 63% were infected with S. flexneri, 20% with S. dysenteriae type 1, 10% with S. boydii, 4% with S. sonnei, and 3% with S. dysenteriae types 2-10. Children infected with S. dysenteriae type 1, when compared to children infected with other species, were significantly (P<0.05) more likely to have severe gastrointestinal manifestations: grossly bloody stools (78% vs. 33%), more stools in the 24 h before admission (median 25 vs. 11), and rectal prolapse (52% vs. 15%)--and extra-intestinal manifestations--leukemoid reaction (22% vs. 2%), hemolytic-uremic syndrome (8% vs. 1%), severe hyponatremia (58% vs. 26%) and neurologic abnormalities (24% vs. 16%). The overall fatality rate was 10% and did not differ significantly by species. In a multiple regression analysis young age, malnutrition, hyponatremia, lesser stool frequency, documented seizure, and unconsciousness were predictive of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Both severe intestinal disease and extra-intestinal manifestations of shigellosis occur with infection by any of the four species of Shigella, but are most common with S. dysenteriae type 1. Among these inpatient children, the risk of death was high with infection of any of the four Shigella species.","['Khan WA', 'Griffiths JK', 'Bennish ML']",2013,8,5,PLoS One,"Khan WA, et al.

23684833,Evaluation of virulent and live Shigella sonnei vaccine candidates in a gnotobiotic piglet model.,"Newborn gnotobiotic (GB) piglets given virulent Shigella orally develop many of the clinical symptoms and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations that mimic human shigellosis. Shigella sonnei virulent strain Moseley, a mutant ShET2-1,2, lacking enterotoxin SenA and its paralog SenB, and vaccine candidates WRSS1 and WRSs3 were evaluated in this model for rates of diarrhea, colonization and other GI symptoms and pathology. Moseley-infected piglets developed diarrhea from 1 to 7 days, with the highest rates seen on days 2-4 after inoculation. In contrast, WRSs3-infected piglets did not have diarrhea over the entire experimental period. Compared to the Moseley group, lower diarrheal rates were observed in the double enterotoxin mutant and significantly lower in the WRSS1 group. Moseley infection also caused marked mucosal damage in the GI tissues at PID1 to PID8, and induced predominantly proinflammatory cytokine secretion. IL-8 and to a lesser extent IL-6 and IL-1β were observed early after inoculation and IL-12 secretion could be measured till late in infection. The ShET2-1,2 mutant, WRSS1 and WRSs3 also colonized the GI tract in a manner similar to Moseley; however, both vaccine candidates developed milder histopathological indices and cytokine responses. WRSs3-infected animals showed the least pathology. Furthermore, unlike the other strains, WRSs3 was rarely detected in organs outside the gastrointestinal tract. These results support the development of the GB piglet model as a sensitive in vivo oral model for the evaluation of virulence of different Shigella strains which could be applied to other oral vaccine candidates.","['Jeong KI', 'Venkatesan MM', 'Barnoy S', 'Tzipori S']",2013,31,37,Vaccine,"Jeong KI, et al.

In our present study, we have advanced our research by formulating multi-serotype outer membrane vesicles (MOMVs), mixing the OMVs of Shigella dysenteriae 1 Δstx, Shigella flexneri 2a, 3a and 6, S. boydii type 4 and Shigella sonnei to achieve a broad spectrum protection against shigellosis. Adult mice were immunized orally with 50 μg of MOMVs, four times at weekly intervals. Immunological parameters were observed at various time points, before, during and after immunization, in adult mice. Passive protection was examined in their offspring by measuring protective efficacy and studying intestinal colonization, after challenging with various Shigella strains. Immunized dams exhibited a consistent broad spectrum antibody response. 3-4 day-old offspring of immunized dams showed significant long term passive protection against wild type S. flexneri 2a, 3a, and 6, S. boydii type 2 and S. dysenteriae 1. Their stomach extracts, essentially containing mother's milk, have also exhibited significant levels of anti-MOMVs immunoglobulins. In conclusion, MOMVs formulation represents an easy, safe immunization strategy that was found suitable to provide complete passive protection to the neonatal mice against all four serogroups of Shigellae.

23684308,"The Shigella OspC3 effector inhibits caspase-4, antagonizes inflammatory cell death, and promotes epithelial infection.","Caspase-mediated inflammatory cell death acts as an intrinsic defense mechanism against infection. Bacterial pathogens deploy countermeasures against inflammatory cell death, but the mechanisms by which they do this remain largely unclear. In a screen for Shigella flexneri effectors that regulate cell death during infection, we discovered that Shigella infection induced acute inflammatory, caspase-4-dependent epithelial cell death, which is counteracted by the bacterial OspC3 effector. OspC3 interacts with the caspase-4-p19 subunit and inhibits its activation by preventing caspase-4-p19 and caspase-4-p10 heterodimerization by depositing the conserved OspC3 X1-Y-X₂-D-X₃ motif at the putative catalytic pocket of caspase-4. Infection of guinea pigs with a Shigella ospC3-deficient mutant resulted in enhanced inflammatory cell death and associated symptoms, correlating with decreased bacterial burdens. Salmonella Typhimurium and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection also induced caspase-4-dependent epithelial death. These findings highlight the importance of caspase-4-dependent innate immune responses and demonstrate that Shigella delivers a caspase-4-specific inhibitor to delay epithelial cell death and promote infection.","['Kobayashi T', 'Ogawa M', 'Sanada T', 'Mimuro H', 'Kim M', 'Ashida H', 'Akakura R', 'Yoshida M', 'Kawalec M', 'Reichhart JM', 'Mizushima T', 'Sasakawa C']",2013,13,5,Cell Host Microbe,"Kobayashi T, et al.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the protective effect of Lactobacillus casei cell-free culture supernatants (CFCS) against multiple drug resistance (MDR) clinical samples of Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: S. sonnei and S .flexneri was identified by common microbiological and serological methods. Antibiogram with 18 antibiotics were tested for 34 positive cultures by disc diffusion method. The Samples showed considerable resistance to antibiotics. Antimicrobial effects of CFCS were tested against S. sonnei and S. flexneri by agar-well assay and broth micro dilution methods. In addition, the antimicrobial activity remained active treatment after adjust pH 7, adding Proteinase K and heating for L. casei.
RESULTS: The results implicate that L. casei strongly inhibits the development of pathogen samples. In contrast, via the disc diffusion method 4 out of 18 antibiogram have shown complete resistance against the pathogen samples. In addition, the natures of antimicrobial properties have been tested in different conditions such as various pH, temperature and presence of proteinase K.

A 2% sub sample from urban Dhaka Hospital (2008-2011; n = 10,650), and 10% from urban Mirpur Treatment Centre (2009-2011; n = 3,585), were enrolled systematically; whereas, all patients coming from the Health and Demographic Surveillance System area in rural Matlab (2008-2011; n = 6,399) and rural Mirzapur (2010-2011; n = 2,812) were included irrespective of age, sex, and disease severity. A fresh stool specimen was collected for identification of Shigella spp. Of them, 315 (3%) were positive for Shigella in Dhaka, 490 (8%) from Matlab, 109 (3%) from Mirpur and 369 (13%) from Mirzapur and considered as analyzable sample size.
RESULTS: Among all Shigella isolates regardless of age, significant decreases in percentage of S. flexneri over time was observed in Mirpur (55→29%; p value of χ(2)-for trend = 0.019) and Mirzapur (59→47%; p = 0.025). A non-significant decrease was also seen in Dhaka (58→48%), while in Matlab there was a non-significant increase (73→81%). Similar patterns were observed among under-5 children at all sites. Emergence of S. sonnei was found in Dhaka (8→25%; p<0.001) and Mirpur (10→33%; p = 0.015), whereas it decreased in Mirzapur (32→23%; p = 0.056). The emergence of S. boydii was seen in all ages in Mirzapur [(3→28%; p<0.001); (3→27%; p<0.001)]. On the other hand, we saw non-significant percent reductions in S. boydii in Dhaka [overall (25→16%); under-5 (16→9%)]. Decreasing rates of Shigella dysenteriae were observed in Matlab, Mirpur and Mirzapur; whereas, in Dhaka it remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Emergence of S. sonnei and S. boydii as important infectious diarrhea etiologies and variations in geographical diversity underscore the need for monitoring, with possible implications for vaccine development.","['Das SK', 'Ahmed S', 'Ferdous F', 'Farzana FD', 'Chisti MJ', 'Leung DT', 'Malek MA', 'Talukder KA', 'Bardhan PK', 'Salam MA', 'Faruque AS', 'Raqib R']",2013,8,4,PLoS One,"Das SK, et al.

We utilized cryopreserved pre- and post-challenge peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sera from wild-type Shigella flexneri 2a (wt-2457T) challenges. Challenged volunteers were either naïve or subjects who had previously ingested wt-2457T or been immunized with hybrid Escherichia coli-Shigella live oral candidate vaccine (EcSf2a-2). BM and antibody titers were measured against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recombinant invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB); results were correlated with disease severity following challenge. Pre-challenge IgA IpaB-BM and post-challenge IgA LPS-BM in the previously exposed subjects negatively correlated with disease severity upon challenge. Similar results were observed with pre-challenge IgG anti-LPS and anti-IpaB titers in vaccinated volunteers. Inverse correlations between magnitude of pre-challenge IgG antibodies to LPS and IpaB, as well as IgA IpaB-BM and post-challenge IgA LPS-BM with disease severity suggest a role for antigen-specific BM in protection.","['Wahid R', 'Simon JK', 'Picking WL', 'Kotloff KL', 'Levine MM', 'Sztein MB']",2013,148,1,Clin Immunol,"Wahid R, et al.

23644075,Evaluation of immunogenicity and protective efficacy of orally delivered Shigella type III secretion system proteins IpaB and IpaD.,"Shigella spp. are food- and water-borne pathogens that cause shigellosis, a severe diarrheal and dysenteric disease that is associated with a high morbidity and mortality in resource-poor countries. No licensed vaccine is available to prevent shigellosis. We have recently demonstrated that Shigella invasion plasmid antigens (Ipas), IpaB and IpaD, which are components of the bacterial type III secretion system (TTSS), can prevent infection in a mouse model of intranasal immunization and lethal pulmonary challenge. Because they are conserved across Shigella spp. and highly immunogenic, these proteins are excellent candidates for a cross-protective vaccine. Ideally, such a vaccine could be administered to humans orally to induce mucosal and systemic immunity. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Shigella IpaB and IpaD administered orally with a double mutant of the Escherichia coli heat labile toxin (dmLT) as a mucosal adjuvant. We characterized the immune responses induced by oral vs. intranasal immunization and the protective efficacy using a mouse pulmonary infection model. Serum IgG and fecal IgA against IpaB were induced after oral immunization. These responses, however, were lower than those obtained after intranasal immunization despite a 100-fold dosage increase. The level of protection induced by oral immunization with IpaB and IpaD was 40%, while intranasal immunization resulted in 90% protective efficacy. IpaB- and IpaD-specific IgA antibody-secreting cells in the lungs and spleen and T-cell-derived IL-2, IL-5, IL-17 and IL-10 were associated with protection. These results demonstrate the immunogenicity of orally administered IpaB and IpaD and support further studies in humans.","['Heine SJ', 'Diaz-McNair J', 'Martinez-Becerra FJ', 'Choudhari SP', 'Clements JD', 'Picking WL', 'Pasetti MF']",2013,31,28,Vaccine,"Heine SJ, et al.

23638855,Genetic characterization of antimicrobial resistance of Shigella flexneri 1c isolates from patients in Egypt and Pakistan.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella flexneri serotype 1c emerged as a critical isolate from children in Egypt and Pakistan. The pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility (AMS) and resistance genes of this serotype have yet to be characterized.
FINDINGS: Sixty nine S. flexneri 1c isolates isolates were identified from both Egypt (n-46) and Pakistan (n = 23) and tested for AMS by disk diffusion method and minimal inhibitory concentrations were also determined. Isolates were genotyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and five relevant resistance genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), sulI and sulII) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. High resistance was observed in all isolates for ampicillin (AM >96%); trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline (>88%). Most AM-resistant isolates from Egypt (70%) harbored bla(TEM) resistance, while 52% of isolates from Pakistan expressed bla(OXA). All isolates were closely related by PFGE, irrespective of source or time of collection. The sulII gene was present in 100% of isolates from pediatric cases in Egypt, 65% of Pakistan isolates, and 53% of isolates from older Egyptian patients.
CONCLUSIONS: While different Shigella serotypes gathered in specific genotypic groups, 1c serotype isolates formed multiple clusters. Although AMS was considerably high to most commonly used drugs, genetic determinants were variable between countries over time. The data stress the need for a more careful selection of antibiotics in the treatment of shigellosis.","['Ahmed SF', 'Klena J', 'Husain T', 'Monestersky J', 'Naguib A', 'Wasfy MO']",2013,12,,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,"Ahmed SF, et al.

23637978,Applied mixed generalized additive model to assess the effect of temperature on the incidence of bacillary dysentery and its forecast.,"BACKGROUND: Association between bacillary dysentery (BD) disease and temperature has been reported in some studies applying Poisson regression model, however the effect estimation might be biased due to the data autocorrelation. Furthermore the temperature effect distributed in the time of different lags has not been studied either. The purpose of this work was to obtaining the association between the BD counts and the climatic factors such as temperature in the form of the weighted averages, concerning the autocorrelation pattern of the model residuals, and to make short term predictions using the model. The data was collected in the city of Shanghai from 2004 to 2008.
METHODS: We used mixed generalized additive model (MGAM) to analyze data on bacillary dysentery, temperature and other covariates with autoregressive random effect. Short term predictions were made using MGAM with the moving average of the BD counts.
MAIN RESULTS: Our results showed that temperature was significant linearly associated with the logarithm of BD count for temperature in the range from 12°C to 22°C. Optimal weights in the temperature effect have been obtained, in which the one of 1-day-lag was close to 0, and the one of 2-days-lag was the maximum (p-value of the difference was less than 0.05). The predictive model was showing good fitness on the internal data with R(2) value 0.875, and the good short term prediction effect on the external data with correlation coefficient to be 0.859.
CONCLUSION: According to the model estimation, corresponding Risk Ratio to affect BD was close to 1.1 when temperature effect goes up for 1°C in the range from 12°C to 22°C. And the 1-day incubation period could be inferred from the model estimation. Good prediction has been made using the predictive MGAM.","['Ma W', 'Sun X', 'Song Y', 'Tao F', 'Feng W', 'He Y', 'Zhao N', 'Yuan Z']",2013,8,4,PLoS One,"Ma W, et al.

23602665,Parenteral immunization with IpaB/IpaD protects mice against lethal pulmonary infection by Shigella.,"Shigellosis is an important diarrheal disease, especially among children in the developing world. About 90 million infections with Shigella spp are estimated to appear each year. We previously demonstrated that the type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) proteins IpaB and IpaD are protective antigens when administered intranasally using the mouse lethal pulmonary model. To simplify vaccine administration, we tested the parenteral route for IpaB and IpaD with several adjuvants and compared the immune response and protective efficacy via the intranasal route. We found that the intramuscular administration generated a response consisting of similar levels of serum IgG, a lack of IgA response and higher IL-17 secretion. Therefore, while parenteral administration yielded a unique pattern of immune responses, it retained the ability to protect mice in a lethal pulmonary challenge against S. flexneri when both proteins were used. Our results show the feasibility of generating protective parenteral vaccines against Shigella spp.","['Martinez-Becerra FJ', 'Scobey M', 'Harrison K', 'Choudhari SP', 'Quick AM', 'Joshi SB', 'Middaugh CR', 'Picking WL']",2013,31,24,Vaccine,"Martinez-Becerra FJ, et al.

23589755,Applying mathematical tools to accelerate vaccine development: modeling Shigella immune dynamics.,"We establish a mathematical framework for studying immune interactions with Shigella, a bacteria that kills over one million people worldwide every year. The long-term goal of this novel approach is to inform Shigella vaccine design by elucidating which immune components and bacterial targets are crucial for establishing Shigella immunity. Our delay differential equation model focuses on antibody and B cell responses directed against antigens like lipopolysaccharide in Shigella's outer membrane. We find that antibody-based vaccines targeting only surface antigens cannot elicit sufficient immunity for protection. Additional boosting prior to infection would require a four-orders-of-magnitude increase in antibodies to sufficiently prevent epithelial invasion. However, boosting anti-LPS B memory can confer protection, which suggests these cells may correlate with immunity. We see that IgA antibodies are slightly more effective per molecule than IgG, but more total IgA is required due to spatial functionality. An extension of the model reveals that targeting both LPS and epithelial entry proteins is a promising avenue to advance vaccine development. This paper underscores the importance of multifaceted immune targeting in creating an effective Shigella vaccine. It introduces mathematical models to the Shigella vaccine development effort and lays a foundation for joint theoretical/experimental/clinical approaches to Shigella vaccine design.","['Davis CL', 'Wahid R', 'Toapanta FR', 'Simon JK', 'Sztein MB', 'Levy D']",2013,8,4,PLoS One,"Davis CL, et al.

23570523,"Volatile composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Artemisia absinthium growing in Western Ghats region of North West Karnataka, India.","CONTEXT: Artemisia absinthium L. (Asteraceae) is an aromatic, herbaceous, perennial plant commonly known as wormwood. Artemisia absinthium is traditionally used as an anthelmintic, antiseptic, antispasmodic and for bacillary dysentery, cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.
OBJECTIVE: The essential oil composition of the leaves of A. absinthium growing in the Western Ghats region of North West Karnataka, India, is investigated for the first time in this region and the oil was screened for antimicrobial properties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical composition of the hydro-distilled essential oil obtained from the leaves of A. absinthium was analyzed by GC-FID and GC/MS. The oil was tested against five Gram positive and, eight Gram negative bacteria and three fungi by the tube-dilution method at a concentration range of 5000-9 µg/mL.
RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the leave oil was found to be rich in oxygenated monoterpenes (39.7% and 41.1%). The major compounds were borneol (18.7% and 16.7%), methyl hinokiate (11.9% and 12.9%), isobornyl acetate (4.0% and 4.7%), β-gurjunene (3.8% and 4.4%) and caryophyllene oxide (3.7% and 4.3%), among 64 identified compounds, comprising 91.7% and 90.1% of the total oil. The organism Micrococcus luteus was found more susceptible to the oil with an MIC value of 25 ± 4 µg/mL, followed by Micrococcus flavus, Bacillus subtilis, Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus fumigatus with MIC values of 58 ± 8, 65 ± 8, 84 ± 15 and 91 ± 13 µg/mL, respectively.

23567193,Cross-protection provided by live Shigella mutants lacking major antigens.,"The immune response elicited by Shigella infections is dominated by serotype-specific antibodies recognizing the LPS O-antigens. Although a marked antibody response to invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa-s) shared by all virulent strains is also induced, the varying level of immunity elicited by natural infections is serotype-restricted. Previous vaccines have tried to mimic and achieve this serotype-specific, infection-induced immunity. As, however, the four Shigella species can express 50 different types of O-antigens, current approaches with the aim to induce a broad coverage use a mixture of the most common O-antigens combined in single vaccines. In the current study we present data on an alternative approach to generate immunity protective against multiple serotypes. Mutants lacking both major immune-determinant structures (i.e. the Ipa and O-antigens) were not only highly attenuated, but, unlike their avirulent counterparts still expressing these antigens, elicited a protective immune response to heterologous serotypes in a murine model. Evidence is provided that protection was mediated by the enhanced immunogenic potential of minor conserved antigens. Furthermore, the rough, non-invasive double mutants triggered an immune response different from that induced by the smooth, invasive strains regarding the isotype of antibodies generated. These non-invasive, rough mutants may represent promising candidates for further development into live vaccines for the prophylaxis of bacillary dysentery in areas with multiple endemic serotypes.","['Szijártó V', 'Hunyadi-Gulyás E', 'Emődy L', 'Pál T', 'Nagy G']",2013,303,4,Int J Med Microbiol,"Szijártó V, et al.

Understanding changing resistance patterns is important in determining appropriate antibiotic treatments. This meta-analysis systematically evaluated aminoglycoside resistance in Shigella. A systematic review was constructed based on MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Random-effect models or fixed-effect models were used based on P value considering the possibility of heterogeneity between studies for meta-analysis. Data manipulation and statistical analyses were performed using software STATA 11.0. By means of meta-analysis, we found a lower resistance to three kinds of aminoglycosides in the Europe-America areas during the 12 year study period than that of the Asia-Africa areas. Kanamycin resistance was observed to be the most common drug resistance among Shigella isolates with a prevalence of 6.88% (95%CI: 6.36%-7.43%). Comparison of data from Europe-America and Asia-Africa areas revealed that Shigella flexneri resistance was greater than the resistance calculated for Shigella sonnei. Importantly, Shigella sonnei has played a significant role in aminoglycoside-resistance in recent years. Similarly, data showed that resistance to these drugs in children was higher than the corresponding data of adults. In conclusion, aminoglycoside-resistant Shigella is not an unusual phenomenon worldwide. Distribution in Shigella resistance differs sharply based on geographic areas, periods of time and subtypes. The results from the present study highlight the need for continuous surveillance of resistance and control of antibiotic usage.","['Gu B', 'Ke X', 'Pan S', 'Cao Y', 'Zhuang L', 'Yu R', 'Qian H', 'Liu G', 'Tong M']",2013,27,2,J Biomed Res,"Gu B, et al.

23543709,Characterization of the ospZ promoter in Shigella flexneri and its regulation by VirB and H-NS.,"OspZ is an effector protein of the type III secretion system in Shigella spp. that downregulates the human inflammatory response during bacterial infection. The ospZ gene is located on the large virulence plasmid of Shigella. Many genes on this plasmid are transcriptionally repressed by the nucleoid structuring protein H-NS and derepressed by VirB, a DNA-binding protein that displays homology to the plasmid partitioning proteins ParB and SopB. In this study, we characterized the ospZ promoter and investigated its regulation by H-NS and VirB in Shigella flexneri. We show that H-NS represses and VirB partially derepresses the ospZ promoter. H-NS-mediated repression requires sequences located between -731 and -412 relative to the beginning of the ospZ gene. Notably, the VirB-dependent derepression of ospZ requires the same VirB binding sites as are required for the VirB-dependent derepression of the divergent icsP gene. These sites are centered 425 bp upstream of the ospZ gene but over 1 kb upstream of the icsP transcription start site. Although these VirB binding sites lie closer to ospZ than icsP, the VirB-dependent increase in ospZ promoter activity is lower than that observed at the icsP promoter. This indicates that the proximity of VirB binding sites to Shigella promoters does not necessarily correlate with the level of VirB-dependent derepression. These findings have implications for virulence gene regulation in Shigella and other pathogens that control gene expression using mechanisms of transcriptional repression and derepression.","['Basta DW', 'Pew KL', 'Immak JA', 'Park HS', 'Picker MA', 'Wigley AF', 'Hensley CT', 'Pearson JS', 'Hartland EL', 'Wing HJ']",2013,195,11,J Bacteriol,"Basta DW, et al.

23541744,Cucurbitacin IIa induces caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and enhances autophagy in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.,"Cucurbitacin IIa (CuIIa), a member of cucurbitacin family, is isolated from the root of Hemsleya amabilis which has been used as an ancient remedy for bacillary dysentery and gastroenteritis. The anti-inflammatory properties of CuIIa have long been recognized but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of CuIIa on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The results showed that CuIIa inhibited the proliferation and migration of RAW 264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas CuIIa did not cause apoptosis in unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, it did induce a significant apoptosis in LPS-stimulated cells, which was caspase-3-dependent and associated with downregulation of survivin. Furthermore, LPS induced autophagy in RAW 264.7 cells and this effect was further enhanced by CuIIa as evidenced by increased levels of LC3-II conjugates and formation of LC3 puncta. In addition, CuIIa disrupted actin cytoskeleton via inducing actin aggregation. However, neither the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α, nor the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and NF-κB pathways in LPS-stimulated cells was suppressed by CuIIa treatment. Collectively, these results suggested that induction of apoptosis and enhancement of autophagy contributed to the anti-inflammatory activity of CuIIa against inflammation-related diseases.","['He J', 'Wang Y', 'Xu LH', 'Qiao J', 'Ouyang DY', 'He XH']",2013,16,1,Int Immunopharmacol,"He J, et al.

23537612,Antimicrobial resistance in Libya: 1970-2011.,"Resistance to antimicrobial agents is a major health problem that affects the whole world. Providing information on the past state of antimicrobial resistance in Libya may assist the health authorities in addressing the problem more effectively in the future. Information was obtained mainly from Highwire Press (including PubMed) search for the period 1970-2011 using the terms 'antibiotic resistance in Libya', 'antimicrobial resistance in Libya', 'tuberculosis in Libya', and 'primary and acquired resistance in Libya' in title and abstract. From 1970 to 2011 little data was available on antimicrobial resistance in Libya due to lack of surveillance and few published studies. Available data shows high resistance rates for Salmonella species in the late 1970s and has remained high to the present day. High prevalence rates (54-68%) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were reported in the last decade among S. aureus from patients with burns and surgical wound infections. No reports were found of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) or vancomycin-intermediate-resistant S. aureus (VISA) using standard methods from Libya up to the end of 2011. Reported rates of primary (i.e. new cases) and acquired (i.e. retreatment cases) multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) from the eastern region of Libya in 1971 were 16.6 and 33.3% and in 1976 were 8.6 and 14.7%, in western regions in 1984-1986 were 11 and 21.5% and in the whole country in 2011 were estimated at 3.4 and 29%, respectively. The problem of antibiotic resistance is very serious in Libya. The health authorities in particular and society in general should address this problem urgently. Establishing monitoring systems based on the routine testing of antimicrobial sensitivity and education of healthcare workers, pharmacists, and the community on the health risks associated with the problem and benefits of prudent use of antimicrobials are some steps that can be taken to tackle the problem in the future.","['Ghenghesh KS', 'Rahouma A', 'Tawil K', 'Zorgani A', 'Franka E']",2013,8,1,Libyan J Med,"Ghenghesh KS, et al.

23536399,Quantitative PCR for detection of Shigella improves ascertainment of Shigella burden in children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea in low-income countries.,"Estimates of the prevalence of Shigella spp. are limited by the suboptimal sensitivity of current diagnostic and surveillance methods. We used a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect Shigella in the stool samples of 3,533 children aged <59 months from the Gambia, Mali, Kenya, and Bangladesh, with or without moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD). We compared the results from conventional culture to those from qPCR for the Shigella ipaH gene. Using MSD as the reference standard, we determined the optimal cutpoint to be 2.9 × 10(4) ipaH copies per 100 ng of stool DNA for set 1 (n = 877). One hundred fifty-eight (18%) specimens yielded >2.9 × 10(4) ipaH copies. Ninety (10%) specimens were positive by traditional culture for Shigella. Individuals with ≥ 2.9 × 10(4) ipaH copies have 5.6-times-higher odds of having diarrhea than those with <2.9 × 10(4) ipaH copies (95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 8.5; P < 0.0001). Nearly identical results were found using an independent set of samples. qPCR detected 155 additional MSD cases with high copy numbers of ipaH, a 90% increase from the 172 cases detected by culture in both samples. Among a subset (n = 2,874) comprising MSD cases and their age-, gender-, and location-matched controls, the fraction of MSD cases that were attributable to Shigella infection increased from 9.6% (n = 129) for culture to 17.6% (n = 262) for qPCR when employing our cutpoint. We suggest that qPCR with a cutpoint of approximately 1.4 × 10(4) ipaH copies be the new reference standard for the detection and diagnosis of shigellosis in children in low-income countries. The acceptance of this new standard would substantially increase the fraction of MSD cases that are attributable to Shigella.","['Lindsay B', 'Ochieng JB', 'Ikumapayi UN', 'Toure A', 'Ahmed D', 'Li S', 'Panchalingam S', 'Levine MM', 'Kotloff K', 'Rasko DA', 'Morris CR', 'Juma J', 'Fields BS', 'Dione M', 'Malle D', 'Becker SM', 'Houpt ER', 'Nataro JP', 'Sommerfelt H', 'Pop M', 'Oundo J', 'Antonio M', 'Hossain A', 'Tamboura B', 'Stine OC']",2013,51,6,J Clin Microbiol,"Lindsay B, et al.

23510245,Pathogen-specific risk of chronic gastrointestinal disorders following bacterial causes of foodborne illness.,"BACKGROUND: The US CDC estimates over 2 million foodborne illnesses are annually caused by 4 major enteropathogens: non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp. and Yersinia enterocoltica. While data suggest a number of costly and morbid chronic sequelae associated with these infections, pathogen-specific risk estimates are lacking. We utilized a US Department of Defense medical encounter database to evaluate the risk of several gastrointestinal disorders following select foodborne infections.
METHODS: We identified subjects with acute gastroenteritis between 1998 to 2009 attributed to Salmonella (nontyphoidal) spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp. or Yersinia enterocolitica and matched each with up to 4 unexposed subjects. Medical history was analyzed for the duration of military service time (or a minimum of 1 year) to assess for incident chronic gastrointestinal disorders. Relative risks were calculated using modified Poisson regression while controlling for the effect of covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 1,753 pathogen-specific gastroenteritis cases (Campylobacter: 738, Salmonella: 624, Shigella: 376, Yersinia: 17) were identified and followed for a median of 3.8 years. The incidence (per 100,000 person-years) of PI sequelae among exposed was as follows: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 3.0; dyspepsia, 1.8; constipation, 3.9; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 9.7. In multivariate analyses, we found pathogen-specific increased risk of IBS, dyspepsia, constipation and GERD.
CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm previous studies demonstrating risk of chronic gastrointestinal sequelae following bacterial enteric infections and highlight additional preventable burden of disease which may inform better food security policies and practices, and prompt further research into pathogenic mechanisms.","['Porter CK', 'Choi D', 'Cash B', 'Pimentel M', 'Murray J', 'May L', 'Riddle MS']",2013,13,,BMC Gastroenterol,"Porter CK, et al.

23509722,A pentaplex PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of Shigella species.,"The magnitude of shigellosis in developing countries is largely unknown because an affordable detection method is not available. Current laboratory diagnosis of Shigella spp. is laborious and time consuming and has low sensitivity. Hence, in the present study, a molecular-based diagnostic assay which amplifies simultaneously four specific genes to identify invC for Shigella genus, rfc for S. flexneri, wbgZ for S. sonnei, and rfpB for S. dysenteriae, as well as one internal control (ompA) gene, was developed in a single reaction to detect and differentiate Shigella spp. Validation with 120 Shigella strains and 37 non-Shigella strains yielded 100% specificity. The sensitivity of the PCR was 100 pg of genomic DNA, 5.4 × 10(4) CFU/ml, or approximately 120 CFU per reaction mixture of bacteria. The sensitivity of the pentaplex PCR assay was further improved following preincubation of the stool samples in gram-negative broth. A preliminary study with 30 diarrhoeal specimens resulted in no cross-reaction with other non-Shigella strains tested. We conclude that the developed pentaplex PCR assay is robust and can provide information about the four target genes that are essential for the identification of the Shigella genus and the three Shigella species responsible for the majority of shigellosis cases.","['Ojha SC', 'Yean Yean C', 'Ismail A', 'Singh KK']",2013,2013,,Biomed Res Int,"Ojha SC, et al.

Extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) have been described in this pathogen, which significantly compromises the treatment options for shigellosis. The usual ESBLs seen are sulfhydryl variable (SHV)-type; cefotaximases (CTX-M) are very uncommonly detected.

23505506,"Use of population-based surveillance to define the high incidence of shigellosis in an urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya.","BACKGROUND: Worldwide, Shigella causes an estimated 160 million infections and >1 million deaths annually. However, limited incidence data are available from African urban slums. We investigated the epidemiology of shigellosis and drug susceptibility patterns within a densely populated urban settlement in Nairobi, Kenya through population-based surveillance.
METHODS: Surveillance participants were interviewed in their homes every 2 weeks by community interviewers. Participants also had free access to a designated study clinic in the surveillance area where stool specimens were collected from patients with diarrhea (≥3 loose stools within 24 hours) or dysentery (≥1 stool with visible blood during previous 24 hours). We adjusted crude incidence rates for participants meeting stool collection criteria at household visits who reported visiting another clinic.
RESULTS: Shigella species were isolated from 262 (24%) of 1,096 stool specimens [corrected]. The overall adjusted incidence rate was 408/100,000 person years of observation (PYO) with highest rates among adults 34-49 years old (1,575/100,000 PYO). Isolates were: Shigella flexneri (64%), S. dysenteriae (11%), S. sonnei (9%), and S. boydii (5%). Over 90% of all Shigella isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and sulfisoxazole. Additional resistance included nalidixic acid (3%), ciprofloxacin (1%) and ceftriaxone (1%).
CONCLUSION: More than 1 of every 200 persons experience shigellosis each year in this Kenyan urban slum, yielding rates similar to those in some Asian countries. Provision of safe drinking water, improved sanitation, and hygiene in urban slums are needed to reduce disease burden, in addition to development of effective Shigella vaccines.","['Njuguna HN', 'Cosmas L', 'Williamson J', 'Nyachieo D', 'Olack B', 'Ochieng JB', 'Wamola N', 'Oundo JO', 'Feikin DR', 'Mintz ED', 'Breiman RF']",2013,8,3,PLoS One,"Njuguna HN, et al.

23494968,Studies of the conformational stability of invasion plasmid antigen B from Shigella.,"Shigella spp. are the causative agent of shigellosis, the second leading cause of diarrhea in children of ages 2-5. Despite many years of research, a protective vaccine has been elusive. We recently demonstrated that invasion plasmid antigens B and D (IpaB and IpaD) provide protection against S. flexneri and S. sonnei. These proteins, however, have very different properties which must be recognized and then managed during vaccine formulation. Herein, we employ spectroscopy to assess the stability of IpaB as well as IpgC (invasion protein gene), IpaB's cognate chaperone, and the IpaB/IpgC complex. The resulting data are mathematically summarized into a visual map illustrating the stability of the proteins and their complex as a function of pH and temperature. The IpaB/IpgC complex exhibits thermal stability at higher pH values but, though initially stable, quickly unfolds with increasing temperature when maintained at lower pH. In contrast, IpaB is a much more complex protein exhibiting increased stability at higher pH, but shows initial instability at lower pH values with pH 5 showing a distinct transition. IpgC precipitates at and below pH 5 and is stable above pH 7. Most strikingly, it is clear that complex formation results in stabilization of the two components. This work serves as a basis for the further development of IpaB as a vaccine candidate as well as extends our understanding of the structural stability of the Shigella type III secretion system.","['Choudhari SP', 'Kramer R', 'Barta ML', 'Greenwood JC', 'Geisbrecht BV', 'Joshi SB', 'Picking WD', 'Middaugh CR', 'Picking WL']",2013,22,5,Protein Sci,"Choudhari SP, et al.

23482897,Surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among Shigella species isolated in China during the 7-year period of 2005-2011.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella is a frequent cause of bacterial dysentery in the developing world. Treatment with antibiotics is recommended for shigellosis, but the options are limited due to globally emerging resistance. This study was conducted to determine the frequency and pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility of Shigella in China.
METHODS: We studied the antimicrobial resistance profiles of 308 Shigella spp. strains (260 S. flexneri, 40 S. sonnei, 5 S. boydii, and 3 S. dysenteriae) isolated from fecal samples of patients (age, from 3 months to 92 yr) presenting with diarrhea in different districts of Anhui, China. The antimicrobial resistance of strains was determined by the agar dilution method according to the CSLI guidelines.
RESULTS: The most common serogroup in the Shigella isolates was S. flexneri (n=260, 84.4%), followed by S. sonnei (n=40, 13.0%). The highest resistance rate was found for nalidixic acid (96.4%), followed by ampicillin (93.2%), tetracycline (90.9%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80.8%). Among the isolates tested, 280 (91.0%) were multidrug resistant (resistant to ≥2 agents). The most common resistance pattern was the combination of ampicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (70.8%). Resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline were more common among S. flexneri than among S. sonnei isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: S. flexneri is predominant in Anhui, China, and its higher antimicrobial resistance rate compared with that of S. sonnei is a cause for concern. Continuous monitoring of resistance patterns is necessary to control the spread of resistance in Shigella. The recommendations for antimicrobial treatment must be updated regularly based on surveillance results.","['Yang H', 'Chen G', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu Y', 'Cheng J', 'Hu L', 'Ye Y', 'Li J']",2013,33,2,Ann Lab Med,"Yang H, et al.

23481070,"Drug resistant Shigella flexneri in & around Dibrugarh, north-east India.","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Shigella flexneri is the most common species of Shigella causing diarrhoea and dysentery in Asia including India. Multidrug resistance in Shigella species has been reported worldwide and there is rising concern regarding development of fluoroquinolone resistance. This study was undertaken to find out the resistance pattern of Sh. flexneri, the commonest shigella isolated in Dibrugarh, north east India, including detection of fluoroquinolone resistance and extended spectrum beta lactamases.
METHODS: Stool samples collected from patients of diarrhoea and dysentery were tested for bacterial enteropathogens. Strains of Shigella species were confirmed by biochemical tests. Speciation was done using commercially available polyvalent antiserum. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method against 18 different antibiotics. Extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) detection was done by disc approximation test as well as combination disc method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of different antibiotics were also measured.
RESULTS: Multidrug resistance in Sh. flexneri was found to be common (90.2%) and the commonest phenotypic multi-drug resistance profile was ampicillin-tetracycline-co-trimoxazole-nalidixic acid. High resistance to nalidixic acid was detected in 90.3 per cent isolates (MIC >240 μg/ml) and ciprofloxacin resistance was seen emerging in this region (11.2%, MIC >4 μg/ml). Present of ESBL was phenotypically confirmed in two cases. Besides the fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, piperacillin-tazobactum and the third generation cephalosporins were effective in 87-100 per cent of the isolates.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed high resistance (MIC >240 μg/ml) against nalidixic acid in Sh. flexneri isolates. Ciprofloxacin resistance is also emerging in this region. Shigellosis due to ESBL carrying Shigella can become a serious threat to public health. Guidelines for therapy should be monitored and modified based on regional reports of resistance to antimicrobial agents.","['Nath R', 'Saikia L', 'Choudhury G', 'Sharma D']",2013,137,1,Indian J Med Res,"Nath R, et al.

23463010,Actin-based confinement of calcium responses during Shigella invasion.,"Shigella, the agent of bacillary dysentery, invades epithelial cells by locally inducing actin reorganization. Upon cell invasion, Shigella induces calcium (Ca(2+)) signalling, but its role in invasion has remained unclear. Here we show that components involved in inositol 1, 4, 5- trisphosphate (InsP3) signalling are implicated in Shigella invasion. Although global Ca(2+) responses are dispensable for bacterial invasion, local Ca(2+) responses of unprecedented long duration are associated with invasion sites. Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching experiments indicate that diffusion of small solutes is hindered at Shigella-invasion sites and that diffusion hindrance is dependent on bacterially induced actin reorganization. Computational simulations and experimental challenge of the model support the notion that local accumulation of InsP3 permitted by restricted diffusion and enrichment of InsP3 receptors account for sustained local Ca(2+) increases at entry sites. Thus, cytoskeletal reorganization through diffusion hindrance shapes the duration of local Ca(2+) signals.","['Tran Van Nhieu G', 'Kai Liu B', 'Zhang J', 'Pierre F', 'Prigent S', 'Sansonetti P', 'Erneux C', 'Kuk Kim J', 'Suh PG', 'Dupont G', 'Combettes L']",2013,4,,Nat Commun,"Tran Van Nhieu G, et al.

We assessed this trade-off for four epidemic-prone diseases that require immediate notification of suspected cases: shigellosis, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and cholera in the Korean National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System data for 2001-2007. Timeliness was measured as the time to registration (T R), being the time interval from symptom onset to notification by the clinician to the local public health centre. We introduced a new index, 'time-accuracy trade-off ratio' to indicate time saved by clinical vs. laboratory-based notifications. Clinical notifications comprised 34.4% of total notifications, and these showed a shorter median T R than laboratory-based notifications (1-4 days). The trade-off ratio was greatest for shigellosis (3.3 days), and smallest for typhoid fever (0.6 days). A higher trade-off ratio provides stronger evidence for clinical notification without waiting for laboratory confirmation.","['Yoo HS', 'Cho SI', 'Lee JK', 'Park HK', 'Lee EG', 'Kwon JW']",2013,141,12,Epidemiol Infect,"Yoo HS, et al.

The genome sequence analysis showed that the strains implicated in the outbreak formed three phylogenetically distinct clusters. One cluster represented cases associated with recent exposure to a single strain, whereas the other two clusters represented related but distinct strains of S. sonnei circulating in the OJ community across the UK. The WGS data challenged the conclusions drawn during the initial outbreak investigation and allowed cases of dysentery to be implicated or ruled out of the outbreak that were previously misclassified. This study showed that the resolution achieved using WGS would have clearly defined the outbreak, thus facilitating the promotion of infection control measures within local schools and the dissemination of a stronger public health message to the community.","['McDonnell J', 'Dallman T', 'Atkin S', 'Turbitt DA', 'Connor TR', 'Grant KA', 'Thomson NR', 'Jenkins C']",2013,141,12,Epidemiol Infect,"McDonnell J, et al.

Our study was undertaken as a continuation of our earlier study during 2001 - 2006.The aim of this study was to monitor changes in Shigella serogroups and resistance patterns to antimicrobials among Shigella isolates. Two thousand one hundred fecal samples were obtained from patients with diarrhea during June 2006-June 2011. Isolates were identified by standard microbiological techniques as Shigella spp and the disk diffusion method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility following CLSI guidelines. Of the 2,100 fecal samples, 77 (3.7%) contained Shigella spp, of which 73 (94.8%) were S. flexneri, 3 (3.9%) were S. sonnei and 1 (1.3%) was S. dysentriae type 1. S. boydii was not identified. One hundred percent resistance was noted against nalidixic acid. There were high levels of resistance to other antimicrobials: ampicillin (100%), Co-trimoxazole (89.6%), tetracycline (84.4%), ciprofloxacin (87%) and norfloxacin (83.1%). Most of the isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone except for 2 isolates of S. flexneri. Antibiotic treatment of shigellosis is needed to prevent mortality. Increasing fluoroquinolone resistance leaves us dependent on third generation cephalosporins for treating shigellosis. Emerging resistance to these cephalosporins was seen in our study.","['Mamatha B', 'Rituparna C']",2012,43,6,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,"Mamatha B and Rituparna C.

23391153,Deletion of pic results in decreased virulence for a clinical isolate of Shigella flexneri 2a from China.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella is a major pathogen responsible for bacillary dysentery, a severe form of shigellosis. Severity of the disease depends on the virulence of the infecting strain. Shigella pathogenicity is a multi-gene phenomenon, involving the participation of genes on an unstable large virulence plasmid and chromosomal pathogenicity islands.
RESULTS: A multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay was developed to detect S. flexneri 2a from rural regions of Zhengding (Hebei Province, China). We isolated and tested 86 strains using our mPCR assay, which targeted the ipaH, ial and set1B genes. A clinical strain of S. flexneri 2a 51 (SF51) containing ipaH and ial, but lacking set1B was found. The virulence of this strain was found to be markedly decreased. Further testing showed that the SF51 strain lacked pic. To investigate the role of pic in S. flexneri 2a infections, a pic knockout mutant (SF301-∆ pic) and two complementation strains, SF301-∆ pic/pPic and SF51/pPic, were created. Differences in virulence for SF51, SF301-∆ pic, SF301-∆ pic/pPic, SF51/pPic and S. flexneri 2a 301 (SF301) were compared. Compared with SF301, both SF51 and SF301-∆ pic exhibited lower levels of Hela cell invasion and resulted in reduced keratoconjunctivitis, with low levels of tissue damage seen in murine eye sections. The virulence of SF301-∆ pic and SF51 was partially recovered in vitro and in vivo through the addition of a complementary pic gene.
CONCLUSIONS: The pic gene appears to be involved in an increase in pathogenicity of S. flexneri 2a. This gene assists with bacterial invasion into host cells and alters inflammatory reactions.","['Zhang J', 'Qian L', 'Wu Y', 'Cai X', 'Li X', 'Cheng X', 'Qu D']",2013,13,,BMC Microbiol,"Zhang J, et al.

Since man is the main reservoir of Shigella and human to human transmission is possible, Shigella can easily spread in public and cause outbreaks. In this study, a total of 60 Shigella strains isolated in Ankara, Turkey by years 2001, 2008 and 2009 were investigated by their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, plasmid profile analysis (PPA) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). For epidemiological investigation, the results obtained by antibiotic resistance typing (ART) which was the phenotyping method, was compared to the results of the genotyping methods which were PPA and PFGE. Of the isolates 49 (81.6%) were S.sonnei, 10 (16.6%) were S.flexneri and one was (1.6%) S.dysenteriae. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were evaluated by disc diffusion method and the highest resistance rates were found against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (91.6%), followed by tetracycline (68.3%) and ampicillin (26.6%). Resistance against ampicillin, chloramphenicol and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were found higher in S.flexneri isolates than S.sonnei (p< 0.001). All isolates were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and ceftazidime. S.sonnei demonstrated 12 and S.flexneri demonstrated 4 antibiotic resistance models. All isolates were carrying plasmids with varying sizes and varying numbers between 1 to 7. S.sonnei isolates demonstrated 27 and S.flexneri isolates demonstrated 8 plasmid profiles. S.sonnei isolates were clustered in 4 patterns and S.flexneri were clustered in 5 patterns by PFGE. This method demonstrated obvious clonal similarity among S.sonnei strains isolated in Ankara and discriminative power (DP) was calculated as 0.26. PPA and ART demonstrated higher DP among S.sonnei strains (0.97 and 0.75, respectively). In this study gain or loss of instable genetic mobile elements were thought to be responsible for higher discriminative powers of PPA and ART methods. These typing methods were found to be appropriate for the epidemiological investigation of strains collected in a short time period. PFGE was found to be convenient for the evaluation of clonal relatedness of the strains, however, in such geographical areas where the same clone was in circulation, use of ART and/or PPA together with PFGE would be useful for precise discrimination of Shigella strains.","['Saran B', 'Erdem B', 'Tekeli FA', 'Sahin F', 'Aysev AD']",2013,47,1,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Saran B, et al.

RECENT FINDINGS: This review focuses on aspects of intestinal bacterial infection concerning research developments related to pathogenesis, new therapeutic agents and approaches, as well as potential new vaccine targets.
SUMMARY: In terms of drug utilization, azithromycin was successfully used to eradicate a Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (enterohemorrhagic E. coli) without harmful effects. In the case of Clostridium difficile, fidaxomicin was found to be comparable to or superior to vancomycin depending on study conditions and whether there was concomitant antibiotic use. A novel research finding is the role of galectin 8, which is a danger-sensing lectin, which plays a role in targeting Salmonella for autophagy. In addition, several enteropathogenic E. coli and Shigella effectors were found to inactivate members of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway.","['Hodges K', 'Hecht G']",2013,29,2,Curr Opin Gastroenterol,Hodges K and Hecht G.

In this study, 53 homomultimeric protein complexes and nine heteromultimeric protein complexes from S. flexneri 2a strain 2457T were separated and identified. Among these, three potential homomultimeric protein complexes had not been previously described. One complex, thought to be composed of 12 PhoN1 subunits, is a periplasmic protein with an unknown physiological role encoded on the virulence plasmid of S. flexneri. The abundance of the protein complexes was compared following growth at 37 or 30°C, and the abundance of three protein complexes (PyrB-PyrI, GlmS, and MglB) related to the synthesis of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) appeared to be temperature-dependent. Many studies have shown that LPS is essential to the virulence of S. flexneri. Here, we report the influence of temperature on the amount of LPS.","['Niu C', 'Shang N', 'Liao X', 'Feng E', 'Liu X', 'Wang D', 'Wang J', 'Huang P', 'Hua Y', 'Zhu L', 'Wang H']",2013,12,5,Mol Cell Proteomics,"Niu C, et al.

23318141,Tips and tricks about Shigella invasion of epithelial cells.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, invades the colonic epithelium where it elicits an intense inflammation leading to tissular destruction. Key to bacterial virulence, type III effectors injected into host cells reorganize the actin cytoskeleton and regulate inflammatory responses. Much progress has been made recently in the characterization of these type III effectors. These findings have reshaped our view of Shigella invasion, suggesting a strategy to invade epithelial cells 'discretely' as an initial route of invasion, contrasting with the devastating inflammatory response associated with the disease's acute phase. The diverse roles of Shigella type III effectors highlight the complexity of an infection process where as little as a thousand bacteria are estimated sufficient to cause the disease in humans.","['Carayol N', 'Tran Van Nhieu G']",2013,16,1,Curr Opin Microbiol,Carayol N and Tran Van Nhieu G.

23302570,[Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of Shigella isolated from children with diarrhea].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Shigella isolated from children with diarrhea for the guidance of clinical treatment and prevention and control of bacillary dysentery.
METHOD: A total of 156 strains of Shigella were isolated from feces of children with diarrhea in Zhejiang Xiaoshan Hospital from January 2008 to December 2010. The antimicrobial resistance of the strains was detected by disk diffusion method and the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in these isolates were determined using phenotypic confirmatory test; the isolates of ESBLs producing Shigella sonnei were analyzed by REP-PCR.
RESULT: Among 156 strains of Shigella isolated, the most common groups were Shigella sonnei (130 strains, accounting for 83.3%) and Shigella fleaneri (26 strains, accounting for 16.7%), and 81 (51.9%) strains were identified as ESBLs producers, and the positive rates in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 32.0%, 41.4% and 59.8%, respectively. The results of antibiotic susceptibility test displayed that the resistance rates of ESBLs producing Shigella to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, cefotaxime, piperacillin were higher than 90%. However, the resistance rates to cefepime, ceftazidime, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were low; The resistance of ESBLs producing strains to piperacillin (100% vs. 77.3%), cefotaxime (100% vs. 0), ceftazidime (14.8% vs. 0), cefepime (28.4% vs. 0), cotrimoxazole (95.1% vs. 86.7%) was significantly higher than that of non-ESBLs producing strains (χ(2) = 20.605, 156.000, 12.037, 24.979, 45.040, respectively; P < 0.05). No isolate was resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. There were 7 genotypes among 74 ESBLs producing Shigella sonnei, respectively type A (50), type B (12), type C (8), type D (1), type E (1), type F (1), and type G (1).
CONCLUSION: The isolation rate of ESBLs-producing isolate was high in Shigella from pediatric patients with diarrhea, and the number is going up year by year, and these ESBLs producing Shigella sonnei strains in genotype A are dominant in recent years, Piperacillin/tazobactam is the drug of choice for children with ESBLs producing Shigella infection.","['Zhang CL', 'Shen LM', 'Chu X', 'Mao JF', 'Dong HL']",2012,50,10,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,"Zhang CL, et al.

23285433,The Recent Trends of Shigellosis: A JIPMER Perspective.,"BACKGROUND: The multi-drug resistant Shigella has posed a therapeutic challenge in most parts of the world. In the last few years, there has been a tremendous change in the anti-microbial susceptibility profile of this organism.
AIM: This present study was carried out to determine the current anti-microbial susceptibility pattern of the members of the genus, Shigella in our region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two thausand six hundred fifty eight stool samples from patients with diarrhoea were received between 2008 and 2010. The disc diffusion testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were obtained by the agar dilution method and the E-test. The double disk synergy test was used to confirm the status of the extended beta-lactamase producers.
RESULTS: 74 (2.78%) Shigella spp were isolated, out of which S.flexneri was 90.54%, S.dysenteriae was 2.70%, S.boydii was 1.35% and S.sonnei was 5.40%. 43 (58.108%) strains were isolated from children of 0 to ≤5 years, 13(17.56%) were isolated from children who were >5 years but ≤ 15 years of age and the rest of the 18 (24.32%) were isolated from adult patients. 79% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, followed by 51% which were resistant to nalidixic acid, followed by 50% which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (the MIC of ciprofloxacin was 16μg/ml), and 39.4% which were resistant to furoxone and chloramphenicol respectively. 2 (3%) strains of S.flexneri were found to be resistant to ceftriaxone, which had MICs of > 256µg/ml. The ceftriaxone resistant S. flexneri isolates were confirmed to be extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers by the double disk synergy test.

23285073,Causative species and serotypes of shigellosis in mainland China: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella, the causative agent of shigellosis, is a major global public health concern, particularly in developing countries with poor sanitation. A comprehensive and current understanding of the prevalent species and serotypes of shigellosis is essential for both disease prevention and vaccine development. However, no current data are available on the causative species/serotypes of shigellosis in mainland China during the past decade.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Relevant studies addressing the prevalent species of shigellosis in mainland China from January 2001 to December 2010 were identified from PubMed and the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (in Chinese) until April 2012. A total of 131 eligible articles (136 studies) were included in this review. Meta-analyses showed that the prevalences of S. flexneri and S. sonnei were 76.2% (95% CI, 73.7%-78.5%) and 21.3% (95% CI, 19.0%-23.7%), respectively. Stratified analyses indicated a decrease in the prevalence of S. flexneri cases and an increase in the prevalence of S. sonnei cases concurrent with the rapid economic growth experienced by China in recent years. Moreover, significantly higher rates of S. sonnei were observed in the East, North and Northeast regions of China, as compared to the rest of the country. These phenomena imply the possible association between the prevalent species of Shigella and regional economic status; however, additional factors also exist and require further investigations. Moreover, the two major serotypes S. flexneri 2a and 4c accounted for 21.5% (95% CI, 16.7%-27.4%) and 12.9% (95% CI 9.8%-16.9%) of S. flexneri infections, respectively, in the past decade. However, these results were found to be frequently heterogeneous (p for Q tests <0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an updated review of the causative agents of shigellosis in mainland China and focuses on the importance of strengthening prevention and research efforts on S. sonnei and the newly emerged S. flexneri serotype 4c.","['Chang Z', 'Lu S', 'Chen L', 'Jin Q', 'Yang J']",2012,7,12,PLoS One,"Chang Z, et al.

23283000,O-antigen structure of Shigella flexneri serotype Yv and effect of the lpt-O gene variation on phosphoethanolamine modification of S. flexneri O-antigens.,"Shigella flexneri is the major human pathogen causing shigellosis. O-antigens of all S. flexneri serotypes (except for serotype 6) share the →2)-α-l-Rhap(III)-(1 → 2)-α-l-Rhap(II)-(1 → 3)-α-l-Rhap(I)-(1 → 3)-β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→ basic O-unit, whereas differences between the serotypes are conferred by phage-encoded glucosylation and/or O-acetylation at various positions. Recently, in serotype X and 4a variants called Xv and 4av, respectively, O-antigen modification with phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) has been identified, which is encoded by a plasmid-borne gene (lpt-O) for a PEtN-transferase and confers the monoclonal antibody IV-1(MASF IV-1) determinant to the bacteria. In this study, we elucidated the O-antigen structure of serotype Yv, another MASF IV-1-positive novel variant of S. flexneri. The serotype Yv O-antigen has the same basic carbohydrate backbone structure as that of the ""classical"" serotype Y, but differs in the presence of PEtN at position 3 of Rha(III) (major) or both Rha(II) and Rha(III) (minor). This pattern is similar to that of serotype 4av, but different from the pattern of serotype Xv, which is characterized by major PEtN modification on Rha(II). In serotype Yv, mono- and bisphosphorylated O-units generate a block-copolymeric structure, the former being partially O-acetylated at position 6 of GlcNAc and the latter lacking O-acetylation. Functional analysis revealed a correlation between the serotype-specific PEtN modification pattern and the lpt-O variation in different serotypes: lpt-O(RII) in serotype Xv is better tuned for phosphorylation of Rha(II) and lpt-O(RIII) in serotypes Yv and 4av for phosphorylation of Rha(III). These data enhance our knowledge of S. flexneri serotype conversion mechanisms and help to understand the biosynthesis process of the new O-antigen variants.","['Knirel YA', 'Lan R', 'Senchenkova SN', 'Wang J', 'Shashkov AS', 'Wang Y', 'Perepelov AV', 'Xiong Y', 'Xu J', 'Sun Q']",2013,23,4,Glycobiology,"Knirel YA, et al.

23243250,Phage inactivation of foodborne Shigella on ready-to-eat spiced chicken.,"Shigellosis, also called bacillary dysentery, is an infectious disease caused by Shigella species, including Shigella flexneri, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, and Shigella boydii. Infection with S. flexneri can result in epidemics, and Shigella-contaminated food is often the source of infection, such as ready-to-eat spiced chicken and duck. Therefore, we investigated the ability of Shigella phages to inhibit pathogenic Shigella spp. in ready-to-eat spiced chicken. Food samples were inoculated with individual species (1 × 10(4) cfu/g) or a mixture (S. flexneri 2a, S. dysenteriae, and S. sonnei) to a total concentration of 3 × 10(4) cfu/g. Single phages or a phage cocktail were added thereafter (1 × 10(8) pfu/g or 3 × 10(8) pfu/g), respectively, and samples were incubated at 4°C for 72 h. In general, the application of more phages (3 × 10(8) pfu/g) was the most effective treatment. Phages could reduce bacterial counts by up to 2 log(10)/g after 48 h incubation when treated with the cocktail, and after 72 h the host could not be detected. Similarly, the host in spiced chicken treated with single phage was also sharply reduced after 72 h incubation. The results suggest that an obligately virulent phage cocktail, such as S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, and S. sonnei phages, can effectively reduce potential contamination of Shigella spp. in ready-to-eat chicken products.","['Zhang H', 'Wang R', 'Bao H']",2013,92,1,Poult Sci,"Zhang H, et al.

Cases, their contacts with diarrhoea, and those in certain occupational groups are frequently excluded from work, school, or daycare. In the Netherlands, all contacts attending pre-school (age 0-3) and junior classes in primary school (age 4-5), irrespective of symptoms, are also excluded pending microbiological clearance. We identified risk factors for secondary Shigella infection (SSI) within households and evaluated infection control policy in this regard.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of households where a laboratory confirmed Shigella case was reported in Amsterdam (2002-2009) included all households at high risk for SSI (i.e. any household member under 16 years). Cases were classified as primary, co-primary or SSIs. Using univariable and multivariable binomial regression with clustered robust standard errors to account for household clustering, we examined case and contact factors (Shigella serotype, ethnicity, age, sex, household size, symptoms) associated with SSI in contacts within households.
RESULTS: SSI occurred in 25/ 337 contacts (7.4%): 20% were asymptomatic, 68% were female, and median age was 14 years (IQR: 4-38). In a multivariable model adjusted for case and household factors, only diarrhoea in contacts was associated with SSI (IRR 8.0, 95% CI:2.7-23.8). In a second model, factors predictive of SSI in contacts were the age of case (0-3 years (IRRcase≥6 years:2.5, 95% CI:1.1-5.5) and 4-5 years (IRRcase≥6 years:2.2, 95% CI:1.1-4.3)) and household size (>6 persons (IRR2-4 persons 3.4, 95% CI:1.2-9.5)).
CONCLUSIONS: To identify symptomatic and asymptomatic SSI, faecal screening should be targeted at all household contacts of preschool cases (0-3 years) and cases attending junior class in primary school (4-5 years) and any household contact with diarrhoea. If screening was limited to these groups, only one asymptomatic adult carrier would have been missed, and potential exclusion of 70 asymptomatic contacts <6 years old from school or daycare, who were contacts of cases of all ages, could have been avoided.","['Boveé L', 'Whelan J', 'Sonder GJ', 'van Dam AP', 'van den Hoek A']",2012,12,,BMC Infect Dis,"Boveé L, et al.

Overall, there were 25 cases of self-reported diarrheal illness among 101 respondents to a questionnaire (attack rate: 24.8%). Personnel who consumed food that was prepared at the two hotels where they were lodged were more likely to report diarrhea than those who did not eat at the hotels (40.9% [9/22] versus 20.3% [16/79]; RR=2.1; p=.047). The difference in diarrhea attack rates between lodgers at the two hotels was not statistically significant. Known or putative pathogens were identified in 72.7 percent (8/11) of samples tested: Blastocystis hominis, Shigella sonnei, diffusely adherent Escherichia coli, and norovirus genotypes I and II. The investigation's findings suggested a food-borne etiology from hotel kitchens.

23230296,Bruton's tyrosine kinase regulates Shigella flexneri dissemination in HT-29 intestinal cells.,"Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative intracellular pathogen that infects the intestinal epithelium and utilizes actin-based motility to spread from cell to cell. S. flexneri actin-based motility has been characterized in various cell lines, but studies in intestinal cells are limited. Here we characterized S. flexneri actin-based motility in HT-29 intestinal cells. In agreement with studies conducted in various cell lines, we showed that S. flexneri relies on neural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (N-WASP) in HT-29 cells. We tested the potential role of various tyrosine kinases involved in N-WASP activation and uncovered a previously unappreciated role for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) in actin tail formation in intestinal cells. We showed that Btk depletion led to a decrease in N-WASP phosphorylation which affected N-WASP recruitment to the bacterial surface, decreased the number of bacteria displaying actin-based motility, and ultimately affected the efficiency of spread from cell to cell. Finally, we showed that the levels of N-WASP phosphorylation and Btk expression were increased in response to infection, which suggests that S. flexneri infection not only triggers the production of proinflammatory factors as previously described but also manipulates cellular processes required for dissemination in intestinal cells.","['Dragoi AM', 'Talman AM', 'Agaisse H']",2013,81,2,Infect Immun,"Dragoi AM, et al.

23173983,Microbiological food safety: a dilemma of developing societies.,"Current food safety issues are deleteriously reshaping the life style of the population in the developing world. Socioeconomic status of the population in poorer economies is one of the major determinants to delineate the availability of safe food to the vulnerable population. Assessment of the prevalence of foodborne illness in developing world is the most neglected area to control disease. Botulism, Shigellosis, Campylobacteriosis, Escherichia coli infection, Staphylococcus aureus infection, Salmonellosis, Listeriosis and Cholerae are extensively prevalent and pose a major threat to human health in underdeveloped communities. The existing food safety status of many African, South Asian, Central, and South American developing countries is distressing therefore; it seems much timely to highlight the areas for the improvement to ensure the supply of safe food to the population in these regions. Extensive literature search at PubMed, Science Direct and Medline was carried out during the current year to catch on relevant data from 1976 to date, using selective terms like food safety, South East Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and foodborne illness etc. Efforts were made to restrict the search to low income countries of these regions with reference to specific foodborne pathogens. This report briefly discusses the present food safety situation in these developing countries and associated consequences as prime issues, suggesting foodborne illness to be the most distressing threat for human health and economic growth.","['Akhtar S', 'Sarker MR', 'Hossain A']",2014,40,4,Crit Rev Microbiol,"Akhtar S, et al.

23164762,"The possible mechanisms of Picrasma quassiodes (D. Don) Benn. in the treatment of colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in mice.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Picrasma quassiodes (D. Don) Benn.(PQB) is used in folk medicines for the treatment of colds, upper respiratory infection, acute tonsillitis, acute gastroenteritis, bacillary dysentery and a variety of acute infectious diseases in Asia. Although recent reports indicate that PQB has antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects, its effects on colitis and its inhibitory mechanisms have not been previously reported.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the effects and the mode of action of the extract of Picrasma quassiodes (D. Don) Benn.(PQB) on a model of colitis in mice induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We induced mice colitis using TNBS/ethanol, then different doses of Picrasma quassiodes (D. Don) Benn.(PQB) extract (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day) and sulfasalazine (500 mg/kg/day) were administered by gavage for 7 days after the induction of colitis. The mice body weight, colonic wet weight, colonic lengths, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, macroscopic and histological colon injury were observed. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the colons were determined by immunohistochemical analysis.
RESULTS: PQB administration effectively prevented mice diarrhea, decreasing of the body weights, shortening of colon length and increasing of colon wet weight. Macroscopic and histological examinations also indicated that it was protected against colonic edema, ulceration and MPO activity elevation. Furthermore, PQB inhibited the abnormal secretions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-8. Additionally, administration of PQB effectively inhibited COX-2 and iNOS protein expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PQB has an anti-inflammatory effect on TNBS-induced colitis due to the down-regulations of the productions and expressions of inflammatory mediators, and that it may be a potential inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) drug candidate.","['Zhao W', 'Sun C', 'He J', 'Chen L', 'Zhang Y', 'Sun W']",2013,145,2,J Ethnopharmacol,"Zhao W, et al.

We describe the epidemiology of reportable GI in Ontario by characterizing the incidence of each reportable GI, as well as associated demographics, clinical outcomes, seasonality, risk settings, and likely sources of infection.
METHODS: Reports on laboratory confirmed cases of amebiasis, botulism, campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, giardiasis, hepatitis A, listeriosis, paratyphoid fever, salmonellosis, shigellosis, typhoid fever, illness due to verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC-illness), and yersiniosis, from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 were obtained from Ontario's passive reportable disease surveillance system. Cases were classified by history of relevant travel, association with outbreaks, and likely source of infection, obtained through follow-up of reported cases by local health authorities.
RESULTS: There were 29,897 GI reported by health authorities in Ontario from 2007 to 2009. The most frequently reported diseases were campylobacteriosis (10,916 cases or 36.5% of all GI illnesses) and salmonellosis (7,514 cases, 25.1%). Overall, 26.9% of GI cases reported travel outside of Ontario during the relevant incubation period. Children four years of age and younger had the highest incidence rate for most GI, and significantly more (54.8%, p<0.001) cases occurred among males than females. The most commonly reported sources of infections were food (54.2%), animals (19.8%), and contact with ill persons (16.9%). Private homes (45.5%) and food premises (29.7%) were the most commonly reported exposure settings. Domestic cases of campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, salmonellosis, and VTEC-illness showed seasonal patterns with incidence peaking in the summer months.
CONCLUSIONS: Reportable GI continues to be a burden in Ontario. Since more than one in four GI cases experienced in Ontario were acquired outside of the province, international travel is an important risk factor for most GI. Because private homes are the most commonly reported risk settings and the main suspect sources of infection are food, animal contact and ill persons, these findings support the continued need for public health food safety programs, public education on safe handling of food and animals, and proper hand hygiene practices.","['Vrbova L', 'Johnson K', 'Whitfield Y', 'Middleton D']",2012,12,,BMC Public Health,"Vrbova L, et al.

Here, we show that the effector, IpaH4.5 dampens the pro-inflammatory cytokine response. In both the Sereny test and a murine lung infection model, the Shigella ΔipaH4.5 mutant strain caused more severe inflammatory responses and significantly induced higher pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (MIP-2 and TNF-α) in the lung homogenates of wild type-infected mice. Moreover, there was a threefold decrease in bacterial colonization of the mutant compared with the WT and ΔipaH4.5/ipaH4.5-rescued strains. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that IpaH4.5 specifically interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Ten truncated versions of IpaH4.5 and p65 spanning different regions were constructed and expressed to further map the IpaH binding sites with p65. The results revealed thatthe p65 region spanning amino acids 1-190 of p65 interacted with the IpaH4.5/1-293 N-terminal region. In vitro, IpaH4.5 displayed ubiquitin ligase activity towards ubiquitin and p65. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB was shown to be inhibited by IpaH4.5 utilizing a dual-luciferase reporter gene detection system containing NF-κB promoter response elements. Thus, we conclude that the IpaH4.5 protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase capable of directly regulating the host inflammatory response by inhibiting the NF-κB signalling pathway.","['Wang F', 'Jiang Z', 'Li Y', 'He X', 'Zhao J', 'Yang X', 'Zhu L', 'Yin Z', 'Li X', 'Wang X', 'Liu W', 'Shang W', 'Yang Z', 'Wang S', 'Zhen Q', 'Zhang Z', 'Yu Y', 'Zhong H', 'Ye Q', 'Huang L', 'Yuan J']",2013,15,3,Cell Microbiol,"Wang F, et al.

23049947,A novel plasmid-encoded serotype conversion mechanism through addition of phosphoethanolamine to the O-antigen of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri is the major pathogen causing bacillary dysentery in developing countries. S. flexneri is divided into at least 16 serotypes based on the combination of antigenic determinants present in the O-antigen. All the serotypes (except for serotype 6) share a basic O-unit containing one N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and three l-rhamnose residues, whereas differences between the serotypes are conferred by phage-encoded glucosylation and/or O-acetylation. Serotype Xv is a newly emerged and the most prevalent serotype in China, which can agglutinate with both MASF IV-1 and 7,8 monoclonal antibodies. The factor responsible for the presence of MASF IV-1 (E1037) epitope has not yet been identified. In this study, we analyzed the LPS structure of serotype Xv strains and found that the MASF IV-1 positive phenotype depends on an O-antigen modification with a phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) group attached at position 3 of one of the rhamnose residues. A plasmid carried gene, lpt-O (LPS phosphoethanolamine transferase for O-antigen), mediates the addition of PEtN for serotype Xv and other MASF IV-1 positive strains. These findings reveal a novel serotype conversion mechanism in S. flexneri and show the necessity of further extension of the serotype classification scheme recognizing the MASF IV-1 positive strains as distinctive subtypes.","['Sun Q', 'Knirel YA', 'Lan R', 'Wang J', 'Senchenkova SN', 'Jin D', 'Shashkov AS', 'Xia S', 'Perepelov AV', 'Chen Q', 'Wang Y', 'Wang H', 'Xu J']",2012,7,9,PLoS One,"Sun Q, et al.

22951981,Spontaneous formation of IpaB ion channels in host cell membranes reveals how Shigella induces pyroptosis in macrophages.,"The Gram-negative bacterium Shigella flexneri invades the colonic epithelium and causes bacillary dysentery. S. flexneri requires the virulence factor invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB) to invade host cells, escape from the phagosome and induce macrophage cell death. The mechanism by which IpaB functions remains unclear. Here, we show that purified IpaB spontaneously oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane of target cells forming cation selective ion channels. After internalization, IpaB channels permit potassium influx within endolysosomal compartments inducing vacuolar destabilization. Endolysosomal leakage is followed by an ICE protease-activating factor-dependent activation of Caspase-1 in macrophages and cell death. Our results provide a mechanism for how the effector protein IpaB with its ion channel activity causes phagosomal destabilization and induces macrophage death.

22950074,Quinolone-resistant Shigella flexneri isolated in a patient who travelled to India.,"We report a recent case in which ciprofloxacin-resistant Shigella flexneri was isolated from a 23-yr-old female patient with a history of travel to India. Prior to her admission to our internal medicine department, she experienced symptoms of high fever and generalized weakness from continuous watery diarrhea that developed midway during the trip. S. flexneri was isolated from the stool culture. Despite initial treatment with ciprofloxacin, the stool cultures continued to show S. flexneri growth. In the susceptibility test for antibiotics of the quinolone family, the isolate showed resistance to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], 8 µg/mL), norfloxacin (MIC, 32 µg/mL), ofloxacin (MIC, 8 µg/mL), nalidixic acid (MIC, 256 µg/mL), and intermediate resistance to levofloxacin (MIC, 4 µg/mL). In molecular studies for quinolone resistance related genes, plasmid borne-quinolone resistance genes such as qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr, qepA, and oqxAB were not detected. Two mutations were observed in gyrA (248C→T, 259G→A) and 1 mutation in parC (239G→T). The molecular characteristics of the isolated S. flexneri showed that the isolate was more similar to the strains isolated from the dysentery outbreak in India than those isolated from Korea.","['Jeon YL', 'Nam YS', 'Lim G', 'Cho SY', 'Kim YT', 'Jang JH', 'Kim J', 'Park M', 'Lee HJ']",2012,32,5,Ann Lab Med,"Jeon YL, et al.

22939626,Structurally distinct bacterial TBC-like GAPs link Arf GTPase to Rab1 inactivation to counteract host defenses.,"Rab GTPases are frequent targets of vacuole-living bacterial pathogens for appropriate trafficking of the vacuole. Here we discover that bacterial effectors including VirA from nonvacuole Shigella flexneri and EspG from extracellular Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) harbor TBC-like dual-finger motifs and exhibits potent RabGAP activities. Specific inactivation of Rab1 by VirA/EspG disrupts ER-to-Golgi trafficking. S. flexneri intracellular persistence requires VirA TBC-like GAP activity that mediates bacterial escape from autophagy-mediated host defense. Rab1 inactivation by EspG severely blocks host secretory pathway, resulting in inhibited interleukin-8 secretion from infected cells. Crystal structures of VirA/EspG-Rab1-GDP-aluminum fluoride complexes highlight TBC-like catalytic role for the arginine and glutamine finger residues and reveal a 3D architecture distinct from that of the TBC domain. Structure of Arf6-EspG-Rab1 ternary complex illustrates a pathogenic signaling complex that rewires host Arf signaling to Rab1 inactivation. Structural distinctions of VirA/EspG further predict a possible extensive presence of TBC-like RabGAP effectors in counteracting various host defenses.","['Dong N', 'Zhu Y', 'Lu Q', 'Hu L', 'Zheng Y', 'Shao F']",2012,150,5,Cell,"Dong N, et al.

22936034,Absence of O antigen suppresses Shigella flexneri IcsA autochaperone region mutations.,"The Shigella flexneri IcsA (VirG) protein is a polarly distributed autotransporter protein. IcsA functions as a virulence factor by interacting with the host actin regulatory protein N-WASP, which in turn activates the Arp2/3 complex, initiating actin polymerization. Formation of F-actin comet tails allows bacterial cell-to-cell spreading. Although various accessory proteins such as periplasmic chaperones and the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) complex have been shown to be involved in the export of IcsA, the IcsA translocation mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. A putative autochaperone (AC) region (amino acids 634-735) located at the C-terminal end of the IcsA passenger domain, which forms part of the self-associating autotransporter (SAAT) domain, has been suggested to be required for IcsA biogenesis, as well as for N-WASP recruitment, based on mutagenesis studies. IcsA(i) proteins with linker insertion mutations within the AC region have a significant reduction in production and are defective in N-WASP recruitment when expressed in smooth LPS (S-LPS) S. flexneri. In this study, we have found that the LPS O antigen plays a role in IcsA(i) production based on the use of an rmlD (rfbD) mutant having rough LPS (R-LPS) and a novel assay in which O antigen is depleted using tunicamycin treatment and then regenerated. In addition, we have identified a new N-WASP binding/interaction site within the IcsA AC region.","['Teh MY', 'Tran ENH', 'Morona R']",2012,158,Pt 11,Microbiology (Reading),"Teh MY, et al.

22929850,Molecular screening of major bacterial enteropathogens in human stool samples from diarrhoeal outbreak sites.,"BACKGROUND: V. cholera types have been implicated often in a number of occasions in diarrhoeal outbreaks in Nepal. The recent outbreak in Far Western Nepal, 2009, was also attributed primarily to V. cholera. Molecular tools were used for the first time on some of the samples from the outbreak to screen for major pathogens present in those samples.
METHODS: A commercial multiplex PCR kit based bacterial enteropathogen screening assessment was carried out on 33 human stool samples from areas of a diarrhoeal outbreak in Nepal. A total of 10 pathogenic bacterial strains at the genus level were targeted using primers provided by the manufacturer.
RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 23 samples (69.7%). Vibrio species was detected at an overall frequency of 36.4% followed by Aeromonas spp (33.3%) and Shigella spp (15.2%) along with Verocytotoxin producing E. coli (VTEC) family (15.2%). The frequency of singly occurring pathogen in all samples was 18.2% with most of the bacterial pathogens detected in combination with other pathogens at a frequency of 60.6%. The study also shows that majority 73 (86%) of the research centers didn't start the research yet.
CONCLUSIONS: This first ever molecular screening study shows that bacterial screening is indeed possible in diarrhoeal samples. The results obtained from this study will enable monitoring of future such outbreaks using similar techniques.","['Dixit S', 'Bhandari GP', 'Karmacharya DB', 'Shrestha S', 'Manandhar S', 'Maskey MK']",2011,9,2,J Nepal Health Res Counc,"Dixit S, et al.

22906296,The Shigella human challenge model.,"Shigella is an important bacterial cause of infectious diarrhoea globally. The Shigella human challenge model has been used since 1946 for a variety of objectives including understanding disease pathogenesis, human immune responses and allowing for an early assessment of vaccine efficacy. A systematic review of the literature regarding experimental shigellosis in human subjects was conducted. Summative estimates were calculated by strain and dose. While a total of 19 studies evaluating nine strains at doses ranging from 10 to 1 × 1010 colony-forming units were identified, most studies utilized the S. sonnei strain 53G and the S. flexneri strain 2457T. Inoculum solution and pre-inoculation buffering has varied over time although diarrhoea attack rates do not appear to increase above 75-80%, and dysentery rates remain fairly constant, highlighting the need for additional dose-ranging studies. Expansion of the model to include additional strains from different serotypes will elucidate serotype and strain-specific outcome variability.","['Porter CK', 'Thura N', 'Ranallo RT', 'Riddle MS']",2013,141,2,Epidemiol Infect,"Porter CK, et al.

A major problem in shigellosis is the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. This is the first detailed molecular study on drug resistance of Shigella isolates from the Faisalabad region of Pakistan. Ninety-five Shigella isolates obtained after screening of 2500 stool samples were evaluated for in vitro resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents; the presence or absence of 20 of the most relevant drug resistance genes; and the prevalence of integrons 1, 2, and 3. Shigella flexneri was found to be the most prevalent and most resistant species.

22863732,Shigella sonnei genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis indicate recent global dissemination from Europe.,"Shigella are human-adapted Escherichia coli that have gained the ability to invade the human gut mucosa and cause dysentery(1,2), spreading efficiently via low-dose fecal-oral transmission(3,4). Historically, S. sonnei has been predominantly responsible for dysentery in developed countries but is now emerging as a problem in the developing world, seeming to replace the more diverse Shigella flexneri in areas undergoing economic development and improvements in water quality(4-6). Classical approaches have shown that S. sonnei is genetically conserved and clonal(7). We report here whole-genome sequencing of 132 globally distributed isolates. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the current S. sonnei population descends from a common ancestor that existed less than 500 years ago and that diversified into several distinct lineages with unique characteristics. Our analysis suggests that the majority of this diversification occurred in Europe and was followed by more recent establishment of local pathogen populations on other continents, predominantly due to the pandemic spread of a single, rapidly evolving, multidrug-resistant lineage.","['Holt KE', 'Baker S', 'Weill FX', 'Holmes EC', 'Kitchen A', 'Yu J', 'Sangal V', 'Brown DJ', 'Coia JE', 'Kim DW', 'Choi SY', 'Kim SH', 'da Silveira WD', 'Pickard DJ', 'Farrar JJ', 'Parkhill J', 'Dougan G', 'Thomson NR']",2012,44,9,Nat Genet,"Holt KE, et al.

In this study, we characterize the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance profiles and genotypes of S. sonnei isolates in the Beijing area. From January 2002 to December 2007, a total of 1108 Shigella isolates including 362 S. sonnei were recovered from diarrhea patients at the 302nd Hospital in Beijing. While the frequency of S. flexneri gradually decreased, S. sonnei gradually increased and became the dominant species. A total of 362 S. sonnei isolates were further analyzed for their antimicrobial profiles and 272 revived isolates were selected for genotyping analysis, respectively. High-level antimicrobial resistances were observed in sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (94.5%), ampicillin (40.3%), piperacillin (36.5%), and ceftriaxone (12.8%) with significant single- and multiple-drug resistance increase trends from 2002 to 2007 (P = 0.0000). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that 263 (96.7%) S. sonnei belonged to 1 clonal genotype A, which were further divided into A1-A6 subtypes. While subtype A2 was dominant in the early stage of study years, subtype A4 started to emerge and increased significantly in later years. Antimicrobial resistance rates are statistically different among the 6 subtypes (P = 0.0000), and A4 possessed the highest resistance rates to ampicillin (83.7%) and piperacillin (81.4%). Subtype A3 was highly clustered in inpatients compared to other subtypes (P = 0.0145). This study indicates that a clonal S. sonnei strain has become dominant in the Beijing area, and subtype A4 is responsible for increased antibiotic resistance.","['Qu F', 'Bao C', 'Chen S', 'Cui E', 'Guo T', 'Wang H', 'Zhang J', 'Wang H', 'Tang YW', 'Mao Y']",2012,74,2,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"Qu F, et al.

22847700,Characterization of lipid A profiles from Shigella flexneri variant X lipopolysaccharide.,"RATIONALE: In developing countries, Shigella flexneri (Sf) is the major causative agent of the endemic shigellosis (bacillary dysentery) responsible annually for one million fatalities mostly among infants. Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are characteristic components of the outer membrane of the overwhelming majority of Gram-negative bacteria. Since lipid A is essential for the viability of the Gram-negative bacteria, it is subject to extensive chemical studies with new analytical techniques.
METHODS: Lipid A was released by mild acid hydrolysis from the lipopolysaccharide which was obtained via the phenol/water extraction, purified and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization laser-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-LID-MS/MS).
RESULTS: A detailed structural study of the whole lipid A obtained from S. flexneri variant X was carried out for the first time. Thus, we have shown that lipid A is a heterogeneous mixture having different numbers of acylated and phosphoethanolamine groups attached to the diglucosamine backbone. Furthermore, we found in the phenol phase an unusual hepta-acylated lipid A species, although the abundance was very low.
CONCLUSIONS: MALDI-TOF-MS allowed us to unravel the lipid A heterogeneity, which was not previously reported in Sf LPS. It is well known that slight variations of the chemical structure of lipid A may change its biological activity. Thus, the knowledge of the detailed chemical structure represents an essential step for further development of new preventive or therapeutically active compounds.","['Casabuono AC', 'van der Ploeg CA', 'Rogé AD', 'Bruno SB', 'Couto AS']",2012,26,17,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,"Casabuono AC, et al.

S. boydii-mediated infection assays were performed at both physiological and molecular levels using Caenorhabditis elegans as a host. Continuous exposure of worms to S. boydii showed a reduced life span indicating the pathogenicity of Shigella. Quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis was performed to analyze the expression and regulation of host specific candidate-antimicrobial genes (clec-60, clec-87, lys-7), which were expressed significantly during early infection, but weakened during the latter hours. Increased mortality of mutant RB1285 by S. boydii and Shigella flexneri indicated the role of lys-7 during Shigella infection. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) database was used to analyze the interaction of immune proteins in both C. elegans and humans. In addition, the expression and regulation were revealed about immune genes (clec-61, clec-62, clec-63, F54D5.3 and ZK1320.2), which encode several intermediate immune protein partners (CLEC-61, CLEC-62, CLEC-63, F54D5.3, ZK1320.2, W03D2.6 and THN-2) that interact with LYS-7 and CLEC-60 and were found to play a role in C. elegans immune defense against S. boydii infections. Similarly, the immune genes that are specific to the human defense system, which encode IGHV4-39, A2M, LTF, and CD79A, were predicted to be expressed with LYZ and MBL2, thus indicating their regulation during Shigella infections. Our results using the lowest eukaryotic model system and human database indicated that the major players involved in immunity-related processes appear to be common in cases of Shigella sp. mediated immune responses.

22821978,VirB-mediated positive feedback control of the virulence gene regulatory cascade of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri is a facultative intracellular pathogen that relies on a type III secretion system and its associated effector proteins to cause bacillary dysentery in humans. The genes that encode this virulence system are located on a 230-kbp plasmid and are transcribed in response to thermal, osmotic, and pH signals that are characteristic of the human lower gut. The virulence genes are organized within a regulatory cascade, and the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS represses each of the key promoters. Transcription derepression depends first on the VirF AraC-like transcription factor, a protein that antagonizes H-NS-mediated repression at the intermediate regulatory gene virB. The VirB protein in turn remodels the H-NS-DNA nucleoprotein complexes at the promoters of the genes encoding the type III secretion system and effector proteins, causing these genes to become derepressed. In this study, we show that the VirB protein also positively regulates the expression of its own gene (virB) via a cis-acting regulatory sequence. In addition, VirB positively regulates the gene coding for the VirF protein. This study reveals two hitherto uncharacterized feedback regulatory loops in the S. flexneri virulence cascade that provide a mechanism for the enhanced expression of the principal virulence regulatory genes.","['Kane KA', 'Dorman CJ']",2012,194,19,J Bacteriol,Kane KA and Dorman CJ.

22814677,"Anti-proliferative effect of 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin F on human prostate cancer cells through induction of actin aggregation and cofilin-actin rod formation.","PURPOSE: The cucurbitacins are a class of triterpenoid molecules that possess cytotoxic characteristics for plant defense against herbivore feeding. 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin F (DHCF), a derivative of the cucurbitacin family, has been isolated as an active component from the root of Hemsleya amabilis (Cucurbitaceae), an ancient Chinese remedy for bacillary dysentery, gastroenteritis, and cancers. While the toxicity of other cucurbitacins has been explored in several cancers, little data exist on the effect of DHCF on human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we explore the level and mechanisms of DHCF toxicity on human PCa cell lines.
METHODS: Human PCa DU145, PC3, and LNCaP cells were treated with graded doses of DHCF in vitro, and anti-proliferative, cytotoxic, and proteomic effects were determined using MTS assay, cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescent staining, and western blotting.
RESULTS: DHCF inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase, formation of binucleated cells, and increased levels of apoptosis in all PCa cell lines tested. G-actin depletion, actin aggregation, and rod-like actin fibers, with little effect on microtubule structure, were observed after DHCF treatment. Actin aggregation and cofilin-actin rod formation were highly correlated with rapid and persistent dephosphorylation of cofilin-1 (cofilin). DHCF treatment resulted in upregulation of p21(Cip1) and downregulation of cyclin A in all three PCa cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: The anti-proliferative activity of DHCF on human PCa cells may be brought about by inducing actin aggregation and cofilin-actin rod formation, leading to cell cycle arrest, cytokinesis failure, and apoptosis.","['Ren S', 'Ouyang DY', 'Saltis M', 'Xu LH', 'Zha QB', 'Cai JY', 'He XH']",2012,70,3,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,"Ren S, et al.

22800632,[Analysis of etiological surveillance results of Shigella spp between 2009 and 2010 in Henan province].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the etiologic characteristics of bacillary dysentery found in Henan province, between year 2009 and 2010.
METHODS: In order to explore the distribution of bacterial types, drug susceptibility and the virulence gene carrier situation, 482 strains of Shigella isolated in Henan province between 2009 and 2010 were pathogen-detected and analyzed by serotype screening, anti microbial sensitivity test and PCR methods.
RESULTS: The 482 isolated strains were confirmed to be Shigella by both morphological and biochemical tests. The Shigella strains were divided into 13 serotypes in 2 groups, namely Shigella flexneri (B group) accounting for 72.0% (347/482) and Shigella sonnei (D group), accounting for 28.0% (135/482). The detection rate of Serotype F2a, as the dominant type of Shigella flexneri, decreased from 43.4% (106/245) in 2009 to 33.8% (80/237) in 2010; while the detection rate of Shigella sonnei increased from 13.1% (32/245) to 43.5% (103/237) in the same period. The results of microbial sensitivity tests carried out in year 2009 and 2010, both showed that over 98% of the 185 studied strains were resistant to ampicillin (AMP), trimethoprim-pyrimidine (TMP), tetracycline (TE), streptomycin (S) and nalidixic acid (NA).182 strains were recruited in the virulence factors detection, 67.6% (123/182) of which carried Shigella Enterotoxin 1B (set1B), Shigella Enterotoxin 2 (set2), invasive plasmid antigen H (ipaH) or invasion-related virulence factors (ial) and 24.2% (44/182) of which carried 3 virulence factors mentioned above.
CONCLUSION: The prevalent serotypes of Shigella in Henan province have changed in recent years. The isolated strains showed high resistance to common antibacterial drugs and generally carried virulence factors.","['Mu YJ', 'Zhao JY', 'Luo Q', 'Huang LL', 'Xia SL']",2012,46,4,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Mu YJ, et al.

22793174,Identification of critical residues of the serotype modifying O-acetyltransferase of Shigella flexneri.,"BACKGROUND: Thirteen serotypes of Shigella flexneri (S. flexneri) have been recognised, all of which are capable of causing bacillary dysentery or shigellosis. With the emergence of the newer S. flexneri serotypes, the development of an effective vaccine has only become more challenging. One of the factors responsible for the generation of serotype diversity is an LPS O-antigen modifying, integral membrane protein known as O-acetyltransferase or Oac. Oac functions by adding an acetyl group to a specific O-antigen sugar, thus changing the antigenic signature of the parent S. flexneri strain. Oac is a membrane protein, consisting of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. Oac bears homology to several known and predicted acetyltransferases with most homology existing in the N-terminal transmembrane (TM) regions.
RESULTS: In this study, the conserved motifs in the TM regions and in hydrophilic loops of S. flexneri Oac were targeted for mutagenesis with the aim of identifying the amino acid residues essential for the function of Oac. We previously identified three critical arginines-R73, R75 and R76 in the cytoplasmic loop 3 of Oac. Re-establishing that these arginines are critical, in this study we suggest a catalytic role for R73 and a structural role for R75 and R76 in O-acetylation. Serine-glycine motifs (SG 52-53, GS 138-139 and SYG 274-276), phenylalanine-proline motifs (FP 78-79 and FPV 282-84) and a tryptophan-threonine motif (WT141-142) found in TM segments and residues RK 110-111, GR 269-270 and D333 found in hydrophilic loops were also found to be critical to Oac function.
CONCLUSIONS: By studying the effect of the mutations on Oac's function and assembly, an insight into the possible roles played by the chosen amino acids in Oac was gained. The transmembrane serine-glycine motifs and hydrophilic residues (RK 110-111, GR 269-270 and D333) were shown to have an affect on Oac assembly which suggests a structural role for these motifs. The phenylalanine-proline and the tryptophan-threonine motifs affect Oac function which could suggest a catalytic role for these amino acids.","['Thanweer F', 'Verma NK']",2012,13,,BMC Biochem,Thanweer F and Verma NK.

22762732,Outer membrane vesicles of Shigella boydii type 4 induce passive immunity in neonatal mice.,"Like most other Gram-negative bacteria, Shigella releases outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) into the surrounding environment during growth. In this study, we have exploited OMVs of Shigella as a protective immunogen in a mice model against Shigellosis. Distinctive vesicle secretion was noticed from different Shigella strains. Among them, Shigella boydii type 4 (BCH612) was secreting relatively higher amounts. We immunized female adult mice orally with 32 μg of purified Shigella boydii type 4 (BCH612) OMVs four times at 1-week intervals. Antibodies against these vesicles were detected in immunized sera until 120 days, indicating a persistent immune response. To observe whether the passive immunity had been transferred to the neonates, the immunized female mice were mated and the offspring were challenged orally, with wild-type homologous and heterologous Shigella strains. All offspring of immunized mothers survived the challenge with homologous strain BCH612 and up to 81% protective efficacy was noted against heterologous strains Shigella dysenteriae 1, Shigella flexneri 2a, Shigella flexneri 3a, Shigella flexneri 6 and Shigella sonnei. Our results exhibited for the first time that oral immunization of adult female mice with purified OMVs of Shigella, without any adjuvant, conferred passive protection to their offspring against shigellosis. These findings will contribute to the future development of a potential non-living vaccine candidate against shigellosis.","['Mitra S', 'Barman S', 'Nag D', 'Sinha R', 'Saha DR', 'Koley H']",2012,66,2,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,"Mitra S, et al.

22740547,"Public health significance of zoonotic bacterial pathogens from bushmeat sold in urban markets of Gabon, Central Africa.","Wild animal meat represents an important source of protein for many people in central Africa. Also known as bushmeat, this meat commodity is derived from wild animals hunted under uncontrolled conditions, transported to distant markets under rudimentary or no hygienic methods, and often eviscerated >24 hr after death. Considering the plausible role of wildlife as a reservoir for bacterial zoonotic pathogens, bushmeat may be an important public health risk in Central Africa. This cross-sectional survey served to evaluate the presence of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella in the muscle tissue of 128 wild animal carcasses from several hunted wildlife species (guenons [Cercopithecus spp.], collared mangabeys [Cercocebus torquatus], gray-cheeked mangabeys [Lophocebus albigena], African crested porcupines [Atherurus africanus], duikers [Cephalophus spp.], and red river hogs [Potamocherus porcus]) sold in two markets of Port-Gentil, Gabon, in July and August 2010. Salmonella was detected from one carcass; no Campylobacter or Shigella was detected. If Campylobacter and Shigella were present, the maximum expected prevalence was estimated at 6% and 1%, respectively. In light of such very low apparent muscle contamination levels, bushmeat likely does not represent a health risk per se with respect to Campylobacter, Salmonella, or Shigella. However, because carcass evisceration and skinning can take place within households prior to consumption, consumers should follow strict hygiene and food safety practices to avoid potential health hazards associated with the handling, preparation, or consumption of bushmeat.","['Bachand N', 'Ravel A', 'Onanga R', 'Arsenault J', 'Gonzalez JP']",2012,48,3,J Wildl Dis,"Bachand N, et al.

22737206,"Effects of extreme precipitation to the distribution of infectious diseases in Taiwan, 1994-2008.","The incidence of extreme precipitation has increased with the exacerbation of worldwide climate disruption. We hypothesize an association between precipitation and the distribution patterns that would affect the endemic burden of 8 infectious diseases in Taiwan, including water- and vector-borne infectious diseases. A database integrating daily precipitation and temperature, along with the infectious disease case registry for all 352 townships in the main island of Taiwan was analysed for the period from 1994 to 2008. Four precipitation levels, <130 mm, 130-200 mm, 200-350 mm and >350 mm, were categorized to represent quantitative differences, and their associations with each specific disease was investigated using the Generalized Additive Mixed Model and afterwards mapped on to the Geographical Information System. Daily precipitation levels were significantly correlated with all 8 mandatory-notified infectious diseases in Taiwan. For water-borne infections, extreme torrential precipitation (>350 mm/day) was found to result in the highest relative risk for bacillary dysentery and enterovirus infections when compared to ordinary rain (<130 mm/day). Yet, for vector-borne diseases, the relative risk of dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis increased with greater precipitation only up to 350 mm. Differential lag effects following precipitation were statistically associated with increased risk for contracting individual infectious diseases. This study's findings can help health resource sector management better allocate medical resources and be better prepared to deal with infectious disease outbreaks following future extreme precipitation events.","['Chen MJ', 'Lin CY', 'Wu YT', 'Wu PC', 'Lung SC', 'Su HJ']",2012,7,6,PLoS One,"Chen MJ, et al.

22736391,From lin-benzoguanines to lin-benzohypoxanthines as ligands for Zymomonas mobilis tRNA-guanine transglycosylase: replacement of protein-ligand hydrogen bonding by importing water clusters.,"The foodborne illness shigellosis is caused by Shigella bacteria that secrete the highly cytotoxic Shiga toxin, which is also formed by the closely related enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). It has been shown that tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is essential for the pathogenicity of Shigella flexneri. Herein, the molecular recognition properties of a guanine binding pocket in Zymomonas mobilis TGT are investigated with a series of lin-benzohypoxanthine- and lin-benzoguanine-based inhibitors that bear substituents to occupy either the ribose-33 or the ribose-34 pocket. The three inhibitor scaffolds differ by the substituent at C(6) being H, NH(2), or NH-alkyl. These differences lead to major changes in the inhibition constants, pK(a) values, and binding modes. Compared to the lin-benzoguanines, with an exocyclic NH(2) at C(6), the lin-benzohypoxanthines without an exocyclic NH(2) group have a weaker affinity as several ionic protein-ligand hydrogen bonds are lost. X-ray cocrystal structure analysis reveals that a new water cluster is imported into the space vacated by the lacking NH(2) group and by a conformational shift of the side chain of catalytic Asp102. In the presence of an N-alkyl group at C(6) in lin-benzoguanine ligands, this water cluster is largely maintained but replacement of one of the water molecules in the cluster leads to a substantial loss in binding affinity. This study provides new insight into the role of water clusters at enzyme active sites and their challenging substitution by ligand parts, a topic of general interest in contemporary structure-based drug design.","['Barandun LJ', 'Immekus F', 'Kohler PC', 'Tonazzi S', 'Wagner B', 'Wendelspiess S', 'Ritschel T', 'Heine A', 'Kansy M', 'Klebe G', 'Diederich F']",2012,18,30,Chemistry,"Barandun LJ, et al.

Structures of the O-antigens (O-polysaccharides) of S. flexneri have been under study since 1960s but some gaps still remained. In this work, using one- and two-dimensional (1) H- and (13) C-NMR spectroscopy, the O-polysaccharides of several S. flexneri types were reinvestigated, and their structures were either confirmed (types 2b, 3b, 3c, 5b, X) or amended in respect to the O-acetylation pattern (types 3a, Y, 6, 6a). As a result, the O-acetylation sites were defined in all O-polysaccharides that had not been studied in detail earlier, and the long story of S. flexneri type strain O-antigen structure elucidation is thus completed. New and published data on the S. flexneri O-antigen structures are summarized and discussed in view of serological and genetic relationships of the O-antigens within the Shigella group and between S. flexneri and Escherichia coli.","['Perepelov AV', 'Shekht ME', 'Liu B', 'Shevelev SD', 'Ledov VA', 'Senchenkova SN', ""L'vov VL"", 'Shashkov AS', 'Feng L', 'Aparin PG', 'Wang L', 'Knirel YA']",2012,66,2,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,"Perepelov AV, et al.

Essential to the establishment of the disease is the invasion of the colonic epithelial cells. Here we investigated the role of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen in the ability of S. flexneri to adhere to and invade polarized Caco-2 cells. The S. flexneri 2a O antigen has two preferred chain lengths: a short O antigen (S-OAg) regulated by the WzzB protein and a very long O antigen (VL-OAg) regulated by Wzz pHS2. Mutants with defined deletions of the genes required for O-antigen assembly and polymerization were constructed and assayed for their abilities to adhere to and enter cultured epithelial cells. The results show that both VL- and S-OAg are required for invasion through the basolateral cell membrane. In contrast, the absence of O antigen does not impair adhesion. Purified LPS does not act as a competitor for the invasion of Caco-2 cells by the wild-type strain, suggesting that LPS is not directly involved in the internalization process by epithelial cells.","['Hoare A', 'Bravo D', 'Martinić M', 'Valvano MA', 'Contreras I', 'Álvarez SA']",2012,45,1,Biol Res,"Hoare A, et al.

Recently, increasing coverage of the genome has permitted the prediction of a growing number of genes that are relevant in the context of the immune response. We hereby report the design of twenty-four quantitative PCR primer pairs covering common cytokines, chemoattractants, antimicrobials and enzymes for a rapid, sensitive and quantitative analysis of the rabbit immune response. Importantly, all primer pairs were designed to be used under identical experimental conditions, thereby enabling the simultaneous analysis of all genes in a high-throughput format. This tool was used to analyze the rabbit innate immune response to infection with the human gastrointestinal pathogen Shigella flexneri. Beyond the known inflammatory mediators, we identified IL-22, IL-17A and IL-17F as highly upregulated cytokines and as first responders to infection during the innate phase of the host immune response. This set of qPCR primers also provides a convenient tool for monitoring the rabbit immune response during infection with other pathogens and other inflammatory conditions.","['Schnupf P', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2012,7,6,PLoS One,Schnupf P and Sansonetti PJ.

22606962,"Characterization of Shigella sonnei in Malaysia, an increasingly prevalent etiologic agent of local shigellosis cases.","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is a major public health concern worldwide, especially in developing countries. It is an acute intestinal infection caused by bacteria of the genus Shigella, with a minimum infective dose as low as 10-100 bacterial cells. Increasing prevalence of Shigella sonnei as the etiologic agent of shigellosis in Malaysia has been reported. As there is limited information on the genetic background of S. sonnei in Malaysia, this study aimed to characterize Malaysian S. sonnei and to evaluate the prospect of using multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) for subtyping of local S. sonnei.
METHODS: Forty non-repeat clinical strains of S. sonnei isolated during the years 1997-2000, and 2007-2009 were studied. The strains were isolated from stools of patients in different hospitals from different regions in Malaysia. These epidemiologically unrelated strains were characterized using biotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and MLVA.
RESULTS: The two biotypes identified in this study were biotype a (n = 29, 73%) and biotype g (n = 11, 27%). All the 40 strains were sensitive to kanamycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. Highest resistance rate was observed for streptomycin (67.5%), followed by tetracycline (40%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (37.5%). All the S. sonnei biotype g strains had a core resistance type of streptomycin - trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole - tetracycline whereas the 29 biotype a strains were subtyped into eight resistotypes. All the strains were equally distinguishable by PFGE and MLVA. Overall, PFGE analysis indicated that S. sonnei biotype a strains were genetically more diverse than biotype g strains. Cluster analysis by MLVA was better in grouping the strains according to biotypes, was reflective of the epidemiological information and was equally discriminative as PFGE.
CONCLUSIONS: The S. sonnei strains circulating in Malaysia throughout the period studied were derived from different clones given their heterogeneous nature. MLVA based on seven selected VNTR loci was rapid, reproducible and highly discriminative and therefore may complement PFGE for routine subtyping of S. sonnei.","['Koh XP', 'Chiou CS', 'Ajam N', 'Watanabe H', 'Ahmad N', 'Thong KL']",2012,12,,BMC Infect Dis,"Koh XP, et al.

22572670,"Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Shigella isolates in Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) sites, 2000-2010.","BACKGROUND: Treatment of shigellosis with appropriate antimicrobial agents shortens duration of illness and bacterial shedding, but resistance to commonly used agents is increasing.
METHODS: We describe resistance patterns among Shigella isolates in the United States with use of linked data from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) and National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). FoodNet sites send every 20th Shigella isolate to the NARMS laboratory for susceptibility testing.
RESULTS: During 2000-2010, the NARMS laboratory tested 1376 Shigella isolates from FoodNet sites. Of 1118 isolates (81%) linked to FoodNet, 826 (74%) were resistant to ampicillin, 649 (58%) to streptomycin, 402 (36%) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 355 (32%) to sulfamethoxazole-sulfisoxazole, 312 (28%) to tetracycline, 19 (2%) to nalidixic acid, and 6 (0.5%) to ciprofloxacin. The proportion of Shigella isolates with resistance to TMP-SMX was 40% among white persons, 58% among Hispanic persons, and 75% among persons with a history of international travel. Resistance to at least TMP-SMX and ampicillin was present in 25% of isolate, and 5% were resistant to ampicillin, TMP-SMX, and chloramphenicol. Overall, 5% of isolates showed multidrug resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline, including 49 Shigella flexneri (33%) and 3 Shigella sonnei (0.3%) isolates. Male individuals were more likely than female individuals to be infected with a multidrug-resistant strain (7% versus 3%; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance differed by race, ethnicity, age, travel, and species. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is high; therefore, it is important to look at the susceptibility pattern before starting treatment.","['Shiferaw B', 'Solghan S', 'Palmer A', 'Joyce K', 'Barzilay EJ', 'Krueger A', 'Cieslak P']",2012,54 Suppl 5,,Clin Infect Dis,"Shiferaw B, et al.

22579556,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome during shigellosis.,"Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which is comprised of the triad of haemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal insufficiency, occurs in about 13% of dysenteric patients with shigellosis due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (SD1) infections, who are mostly children less than five years old in Africa and Asia. With a case-fatality rate of about 36%, it is the leading cause of death in SD1 outbreaks. Research suggests that Shiga toxin and lipopolysaccharide from the causative bacteria play roles in pathogenesis. The risk of HUS is increased when inappropriate antimicrobial drugs, against which infecting bacteria are resistant, are used or when any antimicrobial drug is given more than four days after the start of diarrhoea. To prevent HUS, it is advised to initiate an appropriate drug early and to consider withholding antimicrobial therapy in patients presenting more than four days after the onset of diarrhoea.",['Butler T'],2012,106,7,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Butler T.

22574737,"Efficacy of sodium butyrate adjunct therapy in shigellosis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Treatment of shigellosis in rabbits with butyrate reduces clinical severity and counteracts the downregulation of cathelicidin (CAP-18) in the large intestinal epithelia. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether butyrate can be used as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of shigellosis in patients.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group designed clinical trial was conducted. Eighty adult patients with shigellosis were randomized to either the Intervention group (butyrate, n = 40) or the Placebo group (normal saline, n = 40). The Intervention group was given an enema containing sodium butyrate (80 mM), twice daily for 3 days, while the Placebo group received the same dose of normal saline. The primary endpoint of the trial was to assess the efficacy of butyrate in improving clinical, endoscopic and histological features of shigellosis. The secondary endpoint was to study the effect of butyrate on the induction of antimicrobial peptides in the rectum. Clinical outcomes were assessed and concentrations of antimicrobial peptides (LL-37, human beta defensin1 [HBD-1] and human beta defensin 3 [HBD-3]) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β [IL-1β] and interleukin-8 [IL-8]) were measured in the stool. Sigmoidoscopic and histopathological analyses, and immunostaining of LL-37 in the rectal mucosa were performed in a subgroup of patients.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, butyrate therapy led to the early reduction of macrophages, pus cells, IL-8 and IL-1β in the stool and improvement in rectal histopathology. Butyrate treatment induced LL-37 expression in the rectal epithelia. Stool concentration of LL-37 remained significantly higher in the Intervention group on days 4 and 7.
CONCLUSION: Adjunct therapy with butyrate during shigellosis led to early reduction of inflammation and enhanced LL-37 expression in the rectal epithelia with prolonged release of LL-37 in the stool.

22561624,"Antimicrobial resistance in Shigella--rapid increase & widening of spectrum in Andaman Islands, India.","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Shigellosis is known to be a major cause of acute childhood diarrhoea in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, India. Rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance warrants continuous monitoring of sensitivity pattern of bacterial isolates. We report here the salient findings of an ongoing study on shigellosis in Andaman Islands, India, with regards to change in drug resistance pattern during the past one decade.
METHOD: During 2006-2009, stools samples from 412 paediatric diarrhoea patients were collected and processed for isolation and identification of Shigella spp. Susceptibility to 22 antimicrobial drugs was tested and MICs were determined for 3 rd generation cephalosporins, quinolones, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination and gentamicin. Drug susceptibility pattern of these isolates were compared with that of 33 isolates obtained during 2000-2002.
RESULTS: Shigella isolates were recovered from 50 of 412 stool samples processed. Resistance to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin was observed in 100, 96, 94 and 82 per cent of the isolates, respectively. The frequency of resistance to these drugs was significantly (P<0.001) higher than that observed during 2000-2002. Resistance to seven drugs was observed in 2000-2002, whereas resistance to 21 drugs was seen during 2006-2009. The number of drug resistance pattern increased from 13 in 2000-2002 to 43 in 2006-2009. Resistance to newer generation fluoroquinolones, 3 rd generation cephalosporins and augmentin, which was not observed during 2000-2002, appeared during 2006-2009.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of resistance among Shigella isolates has increased substantially between 2000-2002 and 2006-2009 and the spectrum of resistance has widened. At present, the option for antimicrobial therapy in shigellosis in Andaman is limited to a small number of drugs. Continuous local monitoring of resistance patterns is necessary for the appropriate selection of empirical antimicrobial therapy.","['Bhattacharya D', 'Sugunan AP', 'Bhattacharjee H', 'Thamizhmani R', 'Sayi DS', 'Thanasekaran K', 'Manimunda SP', 'Ghosh AR', 'Bharadwaj AP', 'Singhania M', 'Roy S']",2012,135,3,Indian J Med Res,"Bhattacharya D, et al.

In early 2010, Toronto reported increased proportions of the more pathogenic S. flexneri, HIV co-infection and MSM in shigellosis cases since 2009. Analytical methods were used to assess whether S. flexneri had dominated Montréal's MSM cases since 2009 and whether changes had occurred in notifications in MSM and HIV-co-infected MSM. S. flexneri increased by 6·7% per month since 2007 and predominated in MSM since 2009 without changes in HIV co-infection or similar shifts in the general population. The results suggest that the surveillance of Shigella species in order to detect species shifts is beneficial for surveillance, given the potential for increased transmission and severity of S. flexneri in HIV-positive MSM.","['Ratnayake R', 'Allard R', 'Pilon PA']",2012,140,11,Epidemiol Infect,"Ratnayake R, et al.

METHODS AND RESULTS:   Six Shigella spp. strains were isolated from 280 food samples against 16 Shigella isolates from 236 stool samples of symptomatic patients and asymptomatic food handlers during the period from January 2007 to December 2009 in Public Health Regional Laboratory of Nabeul. The detection of ipaH, ipaBCD, ial, ShET-1 and ShET-2 was performed by a PCR technique with specific primers.
CONCLUSIONS:   The use of PCR technique improved the rate of detecting Shigella in stool samples from 6·7 to 14% and in food samples from 2·1 to 8·6%. Percentage of Shigella isolates and ipaH-specific PCR demonstrated a marked pattern of seasonality, increasing in summer and fall seasons for human and food isolates. Amongst the environmental strains, 50% of isolates were invasive. However, for the 16 clinical strains isolated, nine were found to be positive for both ial and ipaBCD gene and 11 were found to produce ShET-1 and/or ShET-2. XbaI PFGE analysis revealed the presence of a predominant clone amongst Shigella sonnei strains recovered from different sources circulating in Nabeul, Tunisia, throughout the years 2007-2009.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:   This study demonstrated the existence of Shigella in food samples and dispersion of different virulence genes amongst these isolates, which appear to constitute an environmental source of epidemic spread. The clonal relationships amongst strains isolated from food elements and human stools indicate the incrimination of different kinds of foods as vehicle of transmission of Shigella, which are usually escaped from detection by traditional culture methods.","['Mokhtari W', 'Nsaibia S', 'Majouri D', 'Ben Hassen A', 'Gharbi A', 'Aouni M']",2012,113,1,J Appl Microbiol,"Mokhtari W, et al.

It senses a wide range of bacteria and viruses or their products, and plays a key role in inducing innate immunity. In this report, NOD1 gene was cloned and characterized in rohu (Labeo rohita), a fish species of highest commercial importance in the Indian subcontinent. The full-length rohu NOD1 (rNOD1) cDNA comprised of 3168 bp with a single open reading frame (ORF) of 2814 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 937 amino acids (aa) with an estimated molecular mass of 106.13 kDa. Structurally, it comprised of one caspase recruitment domain (CARD) at N-terminal, seven leucine rich repeat (LRR) regions at C-terminal and one NACHT domain in between N and C-terminals. Phylogenetically, rNOD1 was closely related to grass carp NOD1 (gcNOD1), and exhibited significant similarity (95.8%) and identity (91.0%) in their amino acids. Ontogenic expression analysis of rNOD1 and its associated down-stream signaling molecule RICK (receptor interacting serine–threonine kinase) by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed their constitutive expression in all embryonic developmental stages. Basal expression analysis of rNOD1 showed its wide range of expression in all examined tissues, highest was in spleen and the lowest was in blood. Inductive expression of rNOD1 was observed following LPS and poly I:C exposure, and Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda and Shigella flexneri infections. Expression of RICK in various organs was significantly enhanced by ligands exposure and bacterial infections, and was correlated with the inductive expression of rNOD1.

22526677,Hierarchies of host factor dynamics at the entry site of Shigella flexneri during host cell invasion.,"Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, induces massive cytoskeletal rearrangement, resulting in its entry into nonphagocytic epithelial cells. The bacterium-engulfing membrane ruffles are formed by polymerizing actin, a process activated through injected bacterial effectors that target host small GTPases and tyrosine kinases. Once inside the host cell, S. flexneri escapes from the endocytic vacuole within minutes to move intra- and intercellularly. We quantified the fluorescence signals from fluorescently tagged host factors that are recruited to the site of pathogen entry and vacuolar escape. Quantitative time lapse fluorescence imaging revealed simultaneous recruitment of polymerizing actin, small GTPases of the Rho family, and tyrosine kinases. In contrast, we found that actin surrounding the vacuole containing bacteria dispersed first from the disassembling membranes, whereas other host factors remained colocalized with the membrane remnants. Furthermore, we found that the disassembly of the membrane remnants took place rapidly, within minutes after bacterial release into the cytoplasm. Superresolution visualization of galectin 3 through photoactivated localization microscopy characterized these remnants as small, specular, patchy structures between 30 and 300 nm in diameter. Using our experimental setup to track the time course of infection, we identified the S. flexneri effector IpgB1 as an accelerator of the infection pace, specifically targeting the entry step, but not vacuolar progression or escape. Together, our studies show that bacterial entry into host cells follows precise kinetics and that this time course can be targeted by the pathogen.","['Ehsani S', 'Santos JC', 'Rodrigues CD', 'Henriques R', 'Audry L', 'Zimmer C', 'Sansonetti P', 'Tran Van Nhieu G', 'Enninga J']",2012,80,7,Infect Immun,"Ehsani S, et al.

22518151,Temperature Depended Role of Shigella flexneri Invasion Plasmid on the Interaction with Acanthamoeba castellanii.,"Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative bacterium causing the diarrhoeal disease shigellosis in humans. The virulence genes required for invasion are clustered on a large 220 kb plasmid encoding type three secretion system (TTSS) apparatus and virulence factors such as adhesions and invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa). The bacterium is transmitted by contaminated food, water, or from person to person. Acanthamoebae are free-living amoebae (FLA) which are found in diverse environments and isolated from various water sources. Different bacteria interact differently with FLA since Francisella tularensis, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella sonnei, and S. dysenteriae are able to grow inside A. castellanii. In contrast, Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces both necrosis and apoptosis to kill A. castellanii. The aim of this study is to examine the role of invasion plasmid of S. flexneri on the interaction with A. castellanii at two different temperatures. A. castellanii in the absence or presence of wild type, IpaB mutant, or plasmid-cured strain S. flexneri was cultured at 30°C and 37°C and the interaction was analysed by viable count of both bacteria and amoebae, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and statistical analysis. The outcome of the interaction was depended on the temperature since the growth of A. castellanii was inhibited at 30°C, and A. castellanii was killed by invasion plasmid mediated necrosis at 37°C.","['Saeed A', 'Johansson D', 'Sandström G', 'Abd H']",2012,2012,,Int J Microbiol,"Saeed A, et al.

Cattle have been described as their main reservoir. STEC O157:H7 is recognized as the predominant serotype in clinical infections, but much less is known about the dominant subtypes in humans and animals or their genetic relatedness. The aims of this study were to compare the STEC O157 subtypes found in sporadic human infections with those in the bovine reservoir using stx-genotyping, phage typing, and XbaI-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and correlate the subtypes with the severity of clinical manifestations. The 280 STEC O157:H7 strains collected included in this study were isolated from HUS (n=122), BD (n=69), and NBD (n=30) cases, and healthy carriers (n=5), and from bovines (n=54) in the abattoirs. The stx-genotyping showed that stx₂/stx(2c(vh-a)) was predominant in human (76.1%) and in bovine strains (55.5%), whereas the second more important genotype was stx₂ (20.8%) in human and stx(2c(vh-a)) (16.7%) in cattle strains. In human strains, PT4 (37.6%), PT49 (24.3%), and PT2 (18.6%) were the most frequent PTs (80.5%). In bovine isolates, PT2 (26%), PT39 (16.7%), and PT4 and PT49 (11.1% each) were predominant. By XbaI-PFGE, all 280 strains yielded 148 patterns with 75% similarity, and 169 strains were grouped in 37 clusters. Identical PT-PFGE-stx profile combinations were detected in strains of both origins: PT4-AREXH01.0011-stx₂/stx(2c(vh-a)) (12 humans and one bovine), PT4-AREXH01.0543-stx₂/stx(2c(vh-a)) (one human and four bovines), PT2-AREXH01.0076-stx₂/stx(2c(vh-a)) (one human and four bovines), PT49-AREXH01.0175-stx₂/stx(2c(vh-a)) (seven humans and one bovine), and PT49-AREXH01.0022-stx₂/stx(2c(vh-a)) (seven humans and one bovine).

22505441,Epidemiological study of shigellosis in an urban area of Argentina.,"INTRODUCTION: Shigellosis represents one of the main causes of bloody diarrhoea in South America. This study aimed to establish the incidence of shigellosis in an urban zone of Buenos Aires, Argentina, by examining the type of Shigella and living conditions associated with this infection.
METHODOLOGY: Between January 2009 and December 2010 we analyzed shigellosis in children admitted to the public health service with bloody diarrhoea from La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A total of 372 children under 15 years old with Shigella present in their stool samples were admitted to the study. Variables studied were patient age, type of Shigella, family economic status, and access to sewage services and safe drinking water.
RESULTS: Shigella flexneri was found to be present in 66.8% of the cases. Incidence was 187 cases/year/100,000 children under 15 years old. Cases were mainly observed during the summer (38.5%) in the population of under 5 years old (69.1% of all cases). The risk of shigellosis increased 12 times in those children who lacked safe drinking water and this risk increased 1.5 times in the population without sewage services. Fewer cases of shigellosis were noted in downtown areas, while hot spots were identified in the suburbs. Treating one case of shigellosis has a local cost of US $976 while assuring safe drinking water and sewage services for one family costs US $634. 
CONCLUSION: Incidence of shigellosis in urban areas is associated with quality of water and sewage services. Policies aimed at providing education and improving public utilities networks can help to reduce the incidence of shigellosis.","['Rolfo F', 'Marin GH', 'Silberman M', 'Pattin J', 'Giugnio S', 'Gatti B', 'Bettiol M', 'Rigoni A']",2012,6,4,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Rolfo F, et al.

22497344,Binding affects the tertiary and quaternary structures of the Shigella translocator protein IpaB and its chaperone IpgC.,"Shigella flexneri uses its type III secretion system (T3SS) to promote invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells as the first step in causing shigellosis, a life-threatening form of dysentery. The Shigella type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) consists of a basal body that spans the bacterial envelope and an exposed needle that injects effector proteins into target cells. The nascent Shigella T3SA needle is topped with a pentamer of the needle tip protein invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD). Bile salts trigger recruitment of the first hydrophobic translocator protein, IpaB, to the tip complex where it senses contact with a host membrane. In the bacterial cytoplasm, IpaB exists in a complex with its chaperone IpgC. Several structures of IpgC have been determined, and we recently reported the 2.1 Å crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (IpaB(74.224)) of IpaB. Like IpgC, the IpaB N-terminal domain exists as a homodimer in solution. We now report that when the two are mixed, these homodimers dissociate and form heterodimers having a nanomolar dissociation constant. This is consistent with the equivalent complexes copurified after they had been co-expressed in Escherichia coli. Fluorescence data presented here also indicate that the N-terminal domain of IpaB possesses two regions that appear to contribute additively to chaperone binding. It is also likely that the N-terminus of IpaB adopts an alternative conformation as a result of chaperone binding. The importance of these findings within the functional context of these proteins is discussed.","['Adam PR', 'Patil MK', 'Dickenson NE', 'Choudhari S', 'Barta M', 'Geisbrecht BV', 'Picking WL', 'Picking WD']",2012,51,19,Biochemistry,"Adam PR, et al.

22480614,Ultrastructural analysis of IpaD at the tip of the nascent MxiH type III secretion apparatus of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative enteric pathogen that is the predominant cause of bacillary dysentery. Shigella uses a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins that alter normal target cell functions to promote pathogen invasion. The type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) consists of a basal body, an extracellular needle, and a tip complex that is responsible for delivering effectors into the host cell cytoplasm. IpaD [Ipa (invasion plasmid antigen)] is the first protein to localize to the T3SA needle tip, where it prevents premature effector secretion and serves as an environmental sensor for triggering recruitment of the translocator protein IpaB to the needle tip. Thus, IpaD would be expected to form a stable structure whose overall architecture supports its functions. It is not immediately obvious from the published IpaD crystal structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2j0o) how a multimer of IpaD would be incorporated at the tip of the first static T3SA intermediate, nor what its functional role would be in building a mature T3SA. Here, we produce three-dimensional reconstructions from transmission electron microscopy images of IpaD localized at the Shigella T3SA needle tip for comparison to needle tips from a Shigella ipaD-null mutant. The results demonstrate that IpaD resides as a homopentamer at the needle tip of the T3SA. Furthermore, comparison to tips assembled from the distal domain IpaD(Δ192-267) mutation shows that IpaD adopts an elongated conformation that facilitates its ability to control type III secretion and stepwise assembly of the T3SA needle tip complex.","['Epler CR', 'Dickenson NE', 'Bullitt E', 'Picking WL']",2012,420,1-2,J Mol Biol,"Epler CR, et al.

22452935,Fluoroquinolone-induced tendinopathy: etiology and preventive measures.,"Tendinopathy is a serious health problem and its etiology is not fully elucidated. Among intrinsic and extrinsic predisposing factors of tendinopathy, the impact of therapeutic agents, especially fluoroquinolone (FQ) group antibiotics, is recently being recognized. FQs are potent bactericidal agents widely used in various infectious diseases, including community acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, chronic osteomyelitis, traveler's diarrhea, typhoid fever, shigellosis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, uncomplicated cervical and urethral gonorrhea and prophylaxis of anthrax. FQs have an acceptable tolerability range. However, many lines of evidence for developing tendinitis and tendon rupture during FQ use have resulted in the addition of a warning in patient information leaflets. FQ-induced tendinopathy presents a challenge for the clinician because healing response is poor due to low metabolic rate in mature tendon tissue and tendinopathy is more likely to develop in patients who are already at high risk, such as elderly, solid organ transplant recipients and concomitant corticosteroid users. FQs become photo-activated under exposure to ultraviolet light, and this process results in formation and accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The subsequent FQ-related oxidative stress disturbs mitochondrial functions, leading to apoptosis. ROS overproduction also has direct cytotoxic effects on extracellular matrix components. Understanding the mechanisms of the FQ-associated tendinopathy may enable designing safer therapeutic strategies, hence optimization of clinical response. In this review, we evaluate multi-factorial etiology of the FQ-induced tendinopathy and discuss proposed preventive measures such as antioxidant use and protection from natural sunlight and artificial ultraviolet exposure.","['Kaleagasioglu F', 'Olcay E']",2012,226,4,Tohoku J Exp Med,Kaleagasioglu F and Olcay E.

22424399,Shigella flexneri utilize the spectrin cytoskeleton during invasion and comet tail generation.,"BACKGROUND: The spectrin cytoskeleton is emerging as an important host cell target of enteric bacterial pathogens. Recent studies have identified a crucial role for spectrin and its associated proteins during key pathogenic processes of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium infections. Here we investigate the involvement of spectrin cytoskeletal components during the pathogenesis of the invasive pathogen Shigella flexneri.
RESULTS: Immunofluorescent microscopy reveals that protein 4.1 (p4.1), but not adducin or spectrin, is robustly recruited to sites of S. flexneri membrane ruffling during epithelial cell invasion. Through siRNA-mediated knockdowns, we identify an important role for spectrin and the associated proteins adducin and p4.1 during S. flexneri invasion. Following internalization, all three proteins are recruited to the internalized bacteria, however upon generation of actin-rich comet tails, we observed spectrin recruitment to those structures in the absence of adducin or p4.1.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of the spectrin cytoskeletal network during S. flexneri pathogenesis and further demonstrate that pathogenic events that were once thought to exclusively recruit the actin cytoskeletal system require additional cytoskeletal networks.","['Ruetz TJ', 'Lin AE', 'Guttman JA']",2012,12,,BMC Microbiol,"Ruetz TJ, et al.

22423359,Identification of the bile salt binding site on IpaD from Shigella flexneri and the influence of ligand binding on IpaD structure.,"Type III secretion (TTS) is an essential virulence factor for Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of shigellosis. The Shigella TTS apparatus (TTSA) is an elegant nanomachine that is composed of a basal body, an external needle to deliver effectors into human cells, and a needle tip complex that controls secretion activation. IpaD is at the tip of the nascent TTSA needle where it controls the first step of TTS activation. The bile salt deoxycholate (DOC) binds to IpaD to induce recruitment of the translocator protein IpaB into the maturing tip complex. We recently used spectroscopic analyses to show that IpaD undergoes a structural rearrangement that accompanies binding to DOC. Here, we report a crystal structure of IpaD with DOC bound and test the importance of the residues that make up the DOC binding pocket on IpaD function. IpaD binds DOC at the interface between helices α3 and α7, with concomitant movement in the orientation of helix α7 relative to its position in unbound IpaD. When the IpaD residues involved in DOC binding are mutated, some are found to lead to altered invasion and secretion phenotypes. These findings suggest that adoption of a DOC bound structural state for IpaD primes the Shigella TTSA for contact with host cells. The data presented here and in the studies leading up to this work provide the foundation for developing a model of the first step in Shigella TTS activation.","['Barta ML', 'Guragain M', 'Adam P', 'Dickenson NE', 'Patil M', 'Geisbrecht BV', 'Picking WL', 'Picking WD']",2012,80,3,Proteins,"Barta ML, et al.

METHODS: Isolates of Shigella (S. flexneri, n = 119 and S. dysenteriae, n = 24) were tested for resistance to ceftriaxone and cefepime by disc diffusion, for MIC by Etest and for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC production. The presence of antimicrobial resistance genes was investigated by PCR using specific primers for bla(TEM), bla(OXA-1), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(SHV) and bla(CMY-2) for all the isolates.
RESULTS: Twenty (16.8%) S. flexneri isolates were resistant/intermediately susceptible to ceftriaxone/cefepime, while all S. dysenteriae were susceptible. In S. flexneri isolates, the MIC(50) values of ceftriaxone and cefepime were found to be 0.032 and 0.125 mg/L, respectively, while their MIC(90) values were 12 and 8 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) for S. dysenteriae were below 1 mg/L for ceftriaxone; however, for cefepime the MIC(90) was found to be 4 mg/L. Of the 20 resistant/intermediately susceptible S. flexneri isolates, 9 were positive for ESBL production and 4 for AmpC production by phenotypic tests. All 20 isolates were found to be positive for bla(TEM), 10 for bla(CTX-M-15), 8 for bla(OXA) and 7 for bla(CMY-2); none was positive for bla(SHV).

22407319,The Shigella flexneri effector OspI deamidates UBC13 to dampen the inflammatory response.,"Many bacterial pathogens can enter various host cells and then survive intracellularly, transiently evade humoral immunity, and further disseminate to other cells and tissues. When bacteria enter host cells and replicate intracellularly, the host cells sense the invading bacteria as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by way of various pattern recognition receptors. As a result, the host cells induce alarm signals that activate the innate immune system. Therefore, bacteria must modulate host inflammatory signalling and dampen these alarm signals. How pathogens do this after invading epithelial cells remains unclear, however. Here we show that OspI, a Shigella flexneri effector encoded by ORF169b on the large plasmid and delivered by the type ΙΙΙ secretion system, dampens acute inflammatory responses during bacterial invasion by suppressing the tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-mediated signalling pathway. OspI is a glutamine deamidase that selectively deamidates the glutamine residue at position 100 in UBC13 to a glutamic acid residue. Consequently, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating activity required for TRAF6 activation is inhibited, allowing S. flexneri OspI to modulate the diacylglycerol-CBM (CARD-BCL10-MALT1) complex-TRAF6-nuclear-factor-κB signalling pathway. We determined the 2.0 Å crystal structure of OspI, which contains a putative cysteine-histidine-aspartic acid catalytic triad. A mutational analysis showed this catalytic triad to be essential for the deamidation of UBC13. Our results suggest that S. flexneri inhibits acute inflammatory responses in the initial stage of infection by targeting the UBC13-TRAF6 complex.","['Sanada T', 'Kim M', 'Mimuro H', 'Suzuki M', 'Ogawa M', 'Oyama A', 'Ashida H', 'Kobayashi T', 'Koyama T', 'Nagai S', 'Shibata Y', 'Gohda J', 'Inoue J', 'Mizushima T', 'Sasakawa C']",2012,483,7391,Nature,"Sanada T, et al.

22401271,In vitro adherence patterns of Shigella serogroups to bovine recto-anal junction squamous epithelial (RSE) cells are similar to those of Escherichia coli O157.,"The aims of this study were to determine whether Shigella species, which are human gastrointestinal pathogens, can adhere to cattle recto-anal junction squamous epithelial (RSE) cells using a recently standardized in vitro adherence assay, and to compare their adherence patterns with that of Escherichia coli O157. Shigella dysenteriae (serogroup A), S. flexneri (serogroup B), S. boydii (serogroup C), and S. sonnei (serogroup D) were tested in adherence assays using both RSE and HEp-2 cells, in the presence or absence of D+mannose. Escherichia coli O157, which adheres to RSE cells in a Type I fimbriae-independent manner, was used as a positive control. Shigella serogroups A, B, D, but not C adhered to RSE cells with distinct adherence patterns in the presence of D+mannose. No such distinction could be made between the four Shigella serogroups based on the HEp-2 cell adherence patterns. Thus, this study provides evidence that certain Shigella serogroups adhere to RSE cells in a manner that is similar to the adherence pattern of E. coli O157.

22389405,Differential expression of gastric MUC5AC in colonic epithelial cells: TFF3-wired IL1 β/Akt crosstalk-induced mucosal immune response against Shigella dysenteriae infection.,"An understanding of the signaling mechanism(s) that regulate the differential expression of gastric mucin MUC5AC in colonic epithelial cells would contribute significantly to investigations of its role in colonic mucosa infected with the bacterial pathogen Shigella dysenteriae. Here we show that S. dysenteriae-Sinduced expression of interleukin-1β upregulates MUC2 expression and the differential expression of MUC5AC. Differential expression of MUC5AC involves crosstalk between interleukin-1β and Akt, whereby the trefoil factor family peptide TFF3 activates Akt by phosphorylation of EGFR. TFF3 also downregulates E-cadherin expression, causing accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β (inactivated) by activated Akt inhibits ubiquitylation of β-catenin, leading to its nuclear translocation, which then induces the expression of MUC5AC and cyclin D1. Accumulation of cyclin D1 alters the cell cycle, promoting cell survival and proliferation. Human colon HT29MTX cells, which overexpress MUC5AC, were resistant to adherence and invasion of S. dysenteriae when compared with other mucin-secreting HT29 cell types. Thus, during infection with S. dysenteriae, crosstalk between interleukin-1β and Akt wired by TFF3 induces expression of MUC5AC in colonic epithelial cells. Differentially expressed gastric MUC5AC aids in mucosal clearance of S. dysenteriae, inhibiting adherence and invasion of the pathogen to colonic epithelial cells, which protects the host.","['Raja SB', 'Murali MR', 'Devaraj H', 'Devaraj SN']",2012,125,Pt 3,J Cell Sci,"Raja SB, et al.

Hence, the need for curative potentials obtainable from medicinal plants becomes inevitable. This study was carried out to assess the antibacterial potentials of crude methanolic extract of the stem bark of Acacia mearnsii against some selected bacteria of clinical importance in shigellosis. The bacteria were inhibited by the extract to produce concentration dependent inhibition zones. The extract exhibited a varied degree of antibacterial activity against all the tested isolates. The MIC values for Gram negative (0.0391-0.3125) mg/mL and those of Gram positive bacteria (0.0781-0.625) mg/mL indicated that the Gram negative bacteria were more inhibited by the extract than the Gram positive bacteria. Average log reduction in viable cell count in time-kill assay ranged between -2.456 Log₁₀ to 2.230 Log₁₀ cfu/mL after 4 h of interaction, and between -2.921 Log₁₀ and 1.447 Log₁₀ cfu/mL after 8 h interaction in 1× MIC and 2× MIC of the extract. The study provided scientific justification for the use of the crude methanolic extract from the stem bark of A. mearnsii in shigellosis.

The loss of large virulence plasmid from virulent Shigella sonnei form I, during cell storage and subculturing, lead to avirulent form II. Environmental factors, e.g. culture media composition, could affect the conversion of the bacterial forms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, some components, i.e., B-complex vitamins, nicotinic acid and riboflavin, were added to the bacterial culture medium and their influence on colony conversion were examined.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that colony conversion is temperature independent and growth on the SS agar did not stabilize the bacterium in form I. Also, the findings showed that colonies on the minimal media supplemented with nicotinic acid and riboflavin, were stable in form I. In addition, according to the findings, the active OxyR has potential binding sites upstream of two genes involved in the replication of large virulence plasmid and expression of O-polysaccharide, i.e., repB and wbgT, respectively.

METHODS: A total of 44 Shigella isolates were collected from Iranian patients admitted to Milad Hospital, Tehran, Iran, during 2008-10. Of these, 37 were serotyped and characterized by MIC determination. A subset of eight suspected extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers (six Shigella sonnei phase II and two Shigella flexneri type 1b) were examined for the presence of genes encoding cephalosporin resistance. The presence of PMQR was assessed in one S. flexneri isolate exhibiting low-level resistance to ciprofloxacin and susceptibility to nalidixic acid. PFGE was performed on 25 S. sonnei phase II isolates.
RESULTS: Of the isolates, 25 (68%) were S. sonnei phase II, with 5 (14%) S. flexneri, 5 (14%) Shigella dysenteriae type 2, and 2 (5%) Shigella boydii type 2. Resistance to at least threeclasses of antimicrobials was detected in all species. The presence of bla(CTX-M-15) and the AmpC β-lactamase producer bla(CMY-2) was confirmed in five and one S. sonnei phase II isolates, respectively. One of the two S. flexneri type 1b that contained bla(CTX-M-15) also harboured a qnrS1 gene. PFGE identified sevenPFGE profiles; the main cluster included 15 of the strains, suggesting low genetic diversity between isolates or the presence of an endemic clone in Iran.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known description of ESBL-producing and AmpC β-lactamase-producing Shigella and of PMQR Shigella in Iran. The emergence of CTX-15, CMY-2 and qnrS1 genes may compromise the treatment of shigellosis.

Isolates of seven strains circulating in China yielded three new sequence types and seven pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, thus demonstrating the existence of high genetic diversity within the isolates. Overall, the seven isolates showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin; one isolate was ciprofloxacin resistant, whilst another developed resistance to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.","['Qiu S', 'Xu X', 'Wang Y', 'Yang G', 'Wang Z', 'Wang H', 'Zhang L', 'Liu N', 'Chen C', 'Liu W', 'Li J', 'Su W', 'Jia L', 'Wang L', 'Jin H', 'Keim P', 'Yuan Z', 'Huang L', 'Song H']",2012,18,4,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Qiu S, et al.

22321794,The structures of coiled-coil domains from type III secretion system translocators reveal homology to pore-forming toxins.,"Many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to alter the normal functions of target cells. Shigella flexneri uses its T3SS to invade human intestinal cells to cause bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) that is responsible for over one million deaths per year. The Shigella type III secretion apparatus is composed of a basal body spanning both bacterial membranes and an exposed oligomeric needle. Host altering effectors are secreted through this energized unidirectional conduit to promote bacterial invasion. The active needle tip complex of S. flexneri is composed of a tip protein, IpaD, and two pore-forming translocators, IpaB and IpaC. While the atomic structure of IpaD has been elucidated and studied, structural data on the hydrophobic translocators from the T3SS family remain elusive. We present here the crystal structures of a protease-stable fragment identified within the N-terminal regions of IpaB from S. flexneri and SipB from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium determined at 2.1 Å and 2.8 Å limiting resolution, respectively. These newly identified domains are composed of extended-length (114 Å in IpaB and 71 Å in SipB) coiled-coil motifs that display a high degree of structural homology to one another despite the fact that they share only 21% sequence identity. Further structural comparisons also reveal substantial similarity to the coiled-coil regions of pore-forming proteins from other Gram-negative pathogens, notably, colicin Ia. This suggests that these mechanistically separate and functionally distinct membrane-targeting proteins may have diverged from a common ancestor during the course of pathogen-specific evolutionary events.","['Barta ML', 'Dickenson NE', 'Patil M', 'Keightley A', 'Wyckoff GJ', 'Picking WD', 'Picking WL', 'Geisbrecht BV']",2012,417,5,J Mol Biol,"Barta ML, et al.

22307019,"Characterization of SfPgdA, a Shigella flexneri peptidoglycan deacetylase required for bacterial persistence within polymorphonuclear neutrophils.","Peptidoglycan deacetylases protect the Gram-positive bacteria cell wall from host lysozymes by deacetylating peptidoglycan. Sequence analysis of the genome of Shigella flexneri predicts a putative polysaccharide deacetylase encoded by the plasmidic gene orf185, renamed here SfpgdA. We demonstrated a peptidoglycan deacetylase (PGD) activity with the purified SfPgdA in vitro. To investigate the role SfPgdA in virulence, we constructed a SfpgdA mutant and studied its phenotype in vitro. The mutant showed an increased sensitivity to lysozyme compared to the parental strain. Moreover, the mutant was rapidly killed by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Specific substitution of histidines residues 120 and 125, located within the PGD catalytic domain, by phenylalanine abolished SfPgdA function. SfPgdA expression is controlled by PhoP. Mutation of phoP increases sensitivity to lysozyme compared to the SfpgdA mutant. Here, we confirmed that SfPgdA expression is enhanced under low magnesium concentration and not produced by the phoP mutant. Ectopic expression of SfPgdA in the phoP mutant restored lysozyme resistance and parental bacterial persistence within PMNs. Together our results indicate that PG deacetylation mechanism likely contributes to Shigella persistence by subverting detection by the host immune system.","['Kaoukab-Raji A', 'Biskri L', 'Bernardini ML', 'Allaoui A']",2012,14,7-8,Microbes Infect,"Kaoukab-Raji A, et al.

24163443,Integration of Spatial and Social Network Analysis in Disease Transmission Studies.,"This study presents a case study of how social network and spatial analytical methods can be used simultaneously for disease transmission modeling. The paper first reviews strategies employed in previous studies and then offers the example of transmission of two bacterial diarrheal diseases in rural Bangladesh. The goal is to understand how diseases vary socially above and beyond the effects of the local neighborhood context. Patterns of cholera and shigellosis incidence are analyzed in space and within kinship-based social networks in Matlab, Bangladesh. Data include a spatially referenced longitudinal demographic database which consists of approximately 200,000 people and laboratory-confirmed cholera and shigellosis cases from 1983 to 2003. Matrices are created of kinship ties between households using a complete network design and distance matrices are also created to model spatial relationships. Moran's I statistics are calculated to measure clustering within both social and spatial matrices. Combined spatial effects-spatial disturbance models are built to simultaneously analyze spatial and social effects while controlling for local environmental context. Results indicate that cholera and shigellosis always clusters in space and only sometimes within social networks. This suggests that the local environment is most important for understanding transmission of both diseases however kinship-based social networks also influence their transmission. Simultaneous spatial and social network analysis can help us better understand disease transmission and this study has offered several strategies on how.","['Emch M', 'Root ED', 'Giebultowicz S', 'Ali M', 'Perez-Heydrich C', 'Yunus M']",2012,105,5,Ann Assoc Am Geogr,"Emch M, et al.

22189658,How we didn't clean up until we washed our hands: shigellosis in an elementary and middle school in North Texas.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella outbreaks often continue for months and are linked frequently to poor hygiene and hand washing. Such outbreaks are found often in day care facilities, but rarely are reported in schools. We present the investigation of an outbreak in autumn 2007 at a building that housed an elementary school and a middle school in separate wings in a small Texas city north of Dallas-Fort Worth.
METHODS: We canvassed local hospitals, school attendance records, and physician offices for cases. Ill individuals were interviewed using a standard questionnaire for symptoms, disease onset, and the presence of the illness in an ill person's household.
RESULTS: A music teacher was the index case for this outbreak of gastrointestinal illness caused by S. sonnei. Ten percent of the students in the school building were ill, and 15 households had secondary cases. Installing liquid soap in dispensers in student restrooms was the initial control measure, followed by sustained instruction in hand washing, scheduled hand washing times, and monitored cleaning and disinfection procedures for surfaces and inanimate objects. Enhanced surveillance detected no new cases in the school district.
CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate soap supplies and repeated instruction in hand washing and its monitoring were needed to control the outbreak.","['Schulte JM', 'Williams L', 'Asghar J', 'Dang T', 'Bedwell S', 'Guerrero K', 'Hamaker D', 'Stonecipher S', 'Zoretic J', 'Chow C']",2012,105,1,South Med J,"Schulte JM, et al.

22185835,Vaccines of the future.,"Vaccines of the future can be divided into three broad groups, namely those of the near future (<10 years); the medium-term future (10-19 years); and the long-term future (20-50 years). For the near future, there is some ""low hanging fruit"" which is clearly on the horizon, such as a Vi-conjugate vaccine for typhoid or a protein-based vaccine for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. Just slightly more distant will be vaccines for shigellosis and a common protein vaccine for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Also in this group, but not as far advanced, will be a vaccine for Group A streptococcus. I place vaccines for the ""big three"", malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in the medium term basket. The sporozoite malaria vaccine RTS-S is closest, but surely a definitive malaria vaccine will also require antigens from other stages of the life cycle. A tuberculosis vaccine will be either a re-engineered BCG; or a molecular vaccine with several protein antigens; or one based on prime-boost strategies. What will delay this is the high cost of clinical trials. For HIV/AIDS, the partial success of the Sanofi-Pasteur prime-boost vaccine has given some hope. I still place much faith in antibody-based vaccines and especially on mimotopes of the env transitional state assumed after initial CD4 binding. Monoclonal antibodies are also leading us in interesting directions. Longer term, the vaccine approach will be successful for autoimmune diseases, e.g. juvenile diabetes and coeliac disease. Cancer vaccines are also briefly surveyed. Adjunct issues needing to be addressed include more extensive combinations; alternate delivery systems; and more intelligently designed adjuvants based on knowledge of the innate immune system.",['Nossal GJ'],2011,29 Suppl 4,,Vaccine,Nossal GJ.

METHODS:  In a nested case-control study participants were sampled from cohorts of male Israeli soldiers aged 18-21 years, serving in field units and followed up for diarrheal diseases. Case patients (n = 177) were subjects who visited the base clinic because diarrhea and were positive for Shigella sonnei (n = 66), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (n = 31) or negative for bacterial pathogens (n = 80; diarrhea of unknown etiology). Controls (n = 418) were subjects who did not suffer from a diarrheal disease during the follow-up. They were matched to case patients by training unit and period. Serum samples were obtained from participants at the beginning of their field training and were tested for anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin (Ig) G and preexisting Shigella sonnei lipopolysaccharide IgG and IgA antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS:  The proportion of H. pylori-infected subjects was significantly lower among case patients with infection of unknown etiology (36.3%) than among controls (56.0%) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], .24-.77; P = .005). The proportion of H. pylori-infected subjects among case patients with S. sonnei shigellosis was also significantly lower than in the control group: 36.3% versus 56.0%. The association persisted after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and preexisting S. sonnei serum IgA antibodies (adjusted OR, 0.37; 95% CI, .14-.95; P = .03) and IgG antibodies (adjusted OR, 0.38; 95% CI, .14-.99; P = .04). The direction of the association between H. pylori infection and ETEC diarrhea was similar, albeit not statistically significant.

22130387,Projected Years Lost due to Disabilities (YLDs) for bacillary dysentery related to increased temperature in temperate and subtropical cities of China.,"The impact of climate change on enteric infection has been a concern in recent years. This study aims to project disability burdens of bacillary dysentery (BD) associated with increasing temperature in different climatic zones in China. Years Lost due to Disabilities (YLDs) were used as the measure of burden of bacillary dysentery in this study. A temperate city in northern China and a subtropical city in southern China were selected as the study areas. The quantitative relationship between temperature and the number of cases in each city was base on the regression models developed in our previous studies. YLDs for bacillary dysentery in 2000 were used as the baseline data. Projection of YLDs for bacillary dysentery in 2020 and 2050 under future temperature scenarios were conducted. Demographic changes over the next 20 to 50 years in study cities were considered in the projections. Under the temperature scenarios alone, the YLDs for bacillary dysentery may increase by up to 80% by 2020 and 174% by 2050 in the temperate city and up to 75% increase in the YLDs by 2020 and a 147% increase by 2050 in the tropical city. Considering potential changes in both temperature and population size and structure, if other factors remain constant, compared with the YLDs observed in 2000, the YLDs for bacillary dysentery may double by 2020 and triple by 2050 in both the temperate and subtropical cities in China. The temperature-related health burden of enteric infection in China may greatly increase in the future if there is no effective intervention. Relevant public health strategies should be developed at an earlier stage to prevent and reduce the impact of infectious disease associated with climate change.","['Zhang Y', 'Bi P', 'Sun Y', 'Hiller JE']",2012,14,2,J Environ Monit,"Zhang Y, et al.

22106748,Differential host immune responses to epidemic and endemic strains of Shigella dysenteriae type I.,"Shigella dysenteriae type 1 causes devastating epidemics in developing countries with high case-fatality rates in all age-groups. The aim of the study was to compare host immune responses to epidemic (T2218) and endemic strains of S. dysenteriae type 1. Shigellacidal activity of serum from rabbits immunized with epidemic or endemic strains, S. dysenteriae type 1-infected patients, and healthy adult controls from Shigella-endemic and non-endemic regions was measured. Immunogenic cross-reactivity of antibodies against Shigella antigens was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Oxidative burst and phagocytic responses of monocytes and neutrophils to selected S. dysenteriae type 1 strains were assessed by flow cytometry. Rabbit antisera against epidemic strain were less effective in killing heterologous bacteria compared to endemic antisera (p=0.0002). Patients showed an increased serum shigellacidal response after two weeks of onset of diarrhoea compared to the acute stage (3-4 days after onset) against their respective homologous strains; the response against T2218 and heterologous endemic S. dysenteriae type 1 strains was not significant. The serum shigellacidal response against all the S. dysenteriae type 1 strains was similar among healthy controls from endemic and non-endemic regions and was comparable with the acute stage response by patients. Compared to endemic strains of S. dysenteriae type 1, T2218 was significantly resistant to phagocytosis by both monocytes and neutrophils. No obvious differences were obtained in the induction of oxidative burst activity and cathelicidin-mediated killing. Cross-reactivity of antibody against antigens present in the epidemic and endemic strains showed some differences in protein/peptide complexity and intensity by Western blot analysis. In summary, epidemic T2218 strain was more resistant to antibody-mediated defenses, namely phagocytosis and shigellacidal activity, compared to endemic S. dysenteriae type 1 strains. Part of this variation may be attributed to the differential complexity of protein/peptide antigens.","['Sayem MA', 'Ahmad SM', 'Rekha RS', 'Sarker P', 'Agerberth B', 'Talukder KA', 'Raqib R']",2011,29,5,J Health Popul Nutr,"Sayem MA, et al.

The choice of antibiotics as well as the prevention of the loss of fluid and electrolytes are important in the clinical recovery. The local resistance rates to antibiotics should be taken into consideration when planning empirical therapy. The aims of this retrospective study were to detect the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of 605 Shigella spp. strains isolated from feces samples of children at Hacettepe University Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital between 1999 and 2010 and to compare the resistance rates by years. Susceptibility to ampicillin, cefotaxime, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (T/S), nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin were determined in Mueller-Hinton Agar by disk diffusion method according to CLSI criteria. Among a total of 605 Shigella strains, 526 were identified as S.sonnei, 69 as S.flexneri, nine as S.boydii and one as S.dysenteriae. Resistance rates to ampicillin, cefotaxime, T/S and nalidixic acid were 24.3%, 3.6% 74.2% and 4.6%, respectively. All of the isolates were found susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Antibiotic resistance rates of the isolates did not exhibit any differences between the years. S.dysenteriae was isolated once in 2003 throughout this 12 year survey and the isolate was found susceptible to T/S and ciprofloxacin. A significant yearly decrease was detected in the number of stool cultures and number of Shigella spp. isolated in stool (p< 0.001). Ampicillin resistance was higher in S.flexneri (77.8%) and S.boydii (62.5%) than S.sonnei (17%). However, T/S resistance was higher in S.sonnei (78.9%) than S.flexneri (52.5%) and S.boydii (11.1%).

22073249,Up-regulation of MUC2 and IL-1β expression in human colonic epithelial cells by Shigella and its interaction with mucins.,"BACKGROUND: The entire gastrointestinal tract is protected by a mucous layer, which contains complex glycoproteins called mucins. MUC2 is one such mucin that protects the colonic mucosa from invading microbes. The initial interaction between microbes and mucins is an important step for microbial pathogenesis. Hence, it was of interest to investigate the relationship between host (mucin) and pathogen interaction, including Shigella induced expression of MUC2 and IL-1β during shigellosis.
METHODS: The mucin-Shigella interaction was revealed by an in vitro mucin-binding assay. Invasion of Shigella dysenteriae into HT-29 cells was analyzed by Transmission electron microscopy. Shigella induced mucin and IL-1β expression were analyzed by RT-PCR and Immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: The clinical isolates of Shigella were found to be virulent by a congo-red binding assay. The in vitro mucin-binding assay revealed both Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella flexneri have binding affinity in the increasing order of: guinea pig small intestinal mucin<guinea pig colonic mucin< Human colonic mucin. Invasion of Shigella dysenteriae into HT-29 cells occurs within 2 hours. Interestingly, in Shigella dysenteriae infected conditions, significant increases in mRNA expression of MUC2 and IL-1β were observed in a time dependent manner. Further, immunofluorescence analysis of MUC2 shows more positive cells in Shigella dysenteriae treated cells than untreated cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that the Shigella species specifically binds to guinea pig colonic mucin, but not to guinea pig small intestinal mucin. The guinea pig colonic mucin showed a greater binding parameter (R), and more saturable binding, suggesting the presence of a finite number of receptor binding sites in the colonic mucin of the host. In addition, modification of mucins with TFMS and sodium metaperiodate significantly reduced mucin-bacterial binding; suggesting that the mucin-Shigella interaction occurs through carbohydrate epitopes on the mucin backbones. Overproduction of MUC2 may alter adherence and invasion of Shigella dysenteriae into human colonic epithelial cells.","['Prakash R', 'Bharathi Raja S', 'Devaraj H', 'Devaraj SN']",2011,6,11,PLoS One,"Prakash R, et al.

22041102,"Intestinal parasitosis and shigellosis among diarrheal patients in Gondar teaching hospital, northwest Ethiopia.","BACKGROUND: Diarrheal diseases are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in developing world. Understanding the etiologic agents of diarrheal diseases and their association with socio-demographic characteristics of patients would help to design better preventive measures. Thus, this study was aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites and enteropathogenic bacteria in diarrheic patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 384 consecutive diarrheal patients who visited Gondar teaching hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia from October 2006 to March 2007 was conducted. Stool specimens were collected and examined for intestinal parasites and enteropathogenic bacteria following standard parasitological and microbiological procedures.
RESULTS: Intestinal parasites were diagnosed in 36.5% of the patients. The most frequently encountered protozoan parasite was Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (7.3%) followed by Giardia lamblia (5.0%), Cryptosporidium parvum (1.8%) and Isospora belli (1.3%). The dominant helminthic parasite identified was Ascaris lumbricoides (5.5%) followed by Strongyloides stercoralis and Schistosoma mansoni (3.1% each), hookworm infection (1.8%), and Hymenolepis species (1.3%). Multiple infections of intestinal parasites were also observed in 6.3% of the patients. Among the enteropathogenic bacteria Shigella and Salmonella species were isolated from 15.6% and 1.6%, respectively, of the patients. Escherichia coli O57:H7 was not found in any of the stool samples tested. Eighty eight percent and 83.3% of the Shigella and Salmonella isolates were resistant to one or more commonly used antibiotics, respectively.Intestinal parasitosis was higher in patients who live in rural area, in patients who were washing their hands after visiting toilet either irregularly with soap and without soap or not at all, in patients who used well and spring water for household consumption, and in patients who had nausea (P < 0.05). Statistically significant associations were also observed between Shigella infections and patients who were using well and spring water for household consumption, and patients who had dysentery and mucoid stool (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of intestinal parasites and Shigella species in diarrheic patients calls for institution of appropriate public health intervention measures to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases. The rational use of antibiotics should also be practiced.","['Huruy K', 'Kassu A', 'Mulu A', 'Worku N', 'Fetene T', 'Gebretsadik S', 'Biadglegne F', 'Belyhun Y', 'Muche A', 'Gelaw A', 'Anagaw B', 'Yifru S', 'Wondie Y', 'Bekele A', 'Tiruneh M', 'Reissig D', 'Moges F']",2011,4,,BMC Res Notes,"Huruy K, et al.

OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of Shigella species among patients with diarrhea at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital.
METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective study was undertaken among patients with diarrhea (n=215) from August to November 2009. A4 pre-tested structured questionnaire was used for collecting data. Stool samples were investigated for identification of Shigella species following standard procedures and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using disc diffusion technique.
RESULTS: The isolation rate of Shigella species was 32/215 [14.9% (95% CI.: 10.5-20.5)], with high prevalence in patents under five years of age. Educational level, latrine usage, source of drinking water, and hand washing habits showed a statistically significant association with the prevalence of Shigella species (p = 0.004).

21984895,Dipstick test for rapid diagnosis of Shigella dysenteriae 1 in bacterial cultures and its potential use on stool samples.,"BACKGROUND: We describe a test for rapid detection of S. dysenteriae 1 in bacterial cultures and in stools, at the bedside of patients.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The test is based on the detection of S. dysenteriae 1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using serotype 1-specific monoclonal antibodies coupled to gold particles and displayed on a one-step immunochromatographic dipstick. A concentration as low as 15 ng/ml of LPS was detected in distilled water and in reconstituted stools in 10 minutes. In distilled water and in reconstituted stools, an unequivocal positive reaction was obtained with 1.6×10⁶ CFU/ml and 4.9×10⁶ CFU/ml of S. dysenteriae 1, respectively. Optimal conditions to read the test have been determined to limit the risk of ambiguous results due to appearance of a faint yellow test band in some negative samples. The specificity was 100% when tested with a battery of Shigella and unrelated strains in culture. When tested on 328 clinical samples in India, Vietnam, Senegal and France by laboratory technicians and in Democratic Republic of Congo by a field technician, the specificity (312/316) was 98.7% (95% CI:96.6-99.6%) and the sensitivity (11/12) was 91.7% (95% CI:59.8-99.6%). Stool cultures and the immunochromatographic test showed concordant results in 98.4 % of cases (323/328) in comparative studies. Positive and negative predictive values were 73.3% (95% CI:44.8-91.1%) and 99.7% (95% CI:98-100%).

METHODS: A hospital-based study was conducted over a 22-year period. All 238 Shigella strains isolated between 2003 and 2009 were compared to 618 isolates from the period 1987-1994 and 218 Shigella strains isolated during 1995-2002 with regard to antimicrobial resistance patterns and patient clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: The predominant species during all periods was Shigella sonnei, with an increasing predominance across the periods (64.0%, 71.5%, and 87.8%, respectively; p<0.001). Neither the prevalence of bloody diarrhea nor other clinical characteristics changed across the study periods, except for the prevalence of dehydration, which increased (11.0%, 20.6%, and 28.6%, respectively; p<0.001). During the period 2003-2009, 69.9% of Shigella were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 35.8% to ampicillin, and 4.7% to nalidixic acid. No case resistant to ciprofloxacin was detected. Multidrug resistance was also found to be similar in the last two periods (24.0% vs. 28.1%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: There was both a microbiological and a clinical change in childhood Shigella gastroenteritis cases over the 22 years. The antibiotic resistance pattern appears to have remained stable over the last two periods.

Thus, there is an urgent need for a rapid diagnostic test for effective therapy and disease management. Previous study showed that a ∼35 kDa antigenic protein from S. flexneri is a potential biomarker. We therefore modelled the three-dimensional structure of the antigen to probe its functionality which could aid in the development of an antigen-based diagnostic. Results showed that the antigen is a transmembrane protein consists of OmpA and OmpA-like domains. The OmpA domain is a beta-barrel embedded in the outer membrane with four surface-exposed extracellular loops. The OmpA-like domain is linked to the OmpA domain with a 17 amino acids linker and located in the periplasmic. Docking of peptidoglycan into the groove of OmpA-like domain might help in catalyzing the bacterial cell wall formation. Both domains are expected to be involved in the virulence, structural stability, pathogenesis and survival of Shigella thus made the 35 kDa protein a suitable shigellosis diagnostic biomarker. This structural elucidation will also enable a better identification of the epitope regions for the development of specific binders to the 35 kDa antigen.","['Yung-Hung RL', 'Ismail A', 'Lim TS', 'Choong YS']",2011,415,2,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Yung-Hung RL, et al.

21969003,Live attenuated Shigella dysenteriae type 1 vaccine strains overexpressing shiga toxin B subunit.,"Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 (S. dysenteriae 1) is unique among the Shigella species and serotypes in the expression of Shiga toxin which contributes to more severe disease sequelae and the ability to cause explosive outbreaks and pandemics. S. dysenteriae 1 shares characteristics with other Shigella species, including the capability of causing clinical illness with a very low inoculum (10 to 100 CFU) and resistance to multiple antibiotics, underscoring the need for efficacious vaccines and therapeutics. Following the demonstration of the successful attenuating capacity of deletion mutations in the guaBA operon in S. flexneri 2a vaccine strains in clinical studies, we developed a series of S. dysenteriae 1 vaccine candidates containing the fundamental attenuating mutation in guaBA. All strains are devoid of Shiga toxin activity by specific deletion of the gene encoding the StxA subunit, which encodes enzymatic activity. The StxB subunit was overexpressed in several derivatives by either plasmid-based constructs or chromosomal manipulation to include a strong promoter. All strains are attenuated for growth in vitro in the HeLa cell assay and for plaque formation and were safe in the Serény test and immunogenic in the guinea pigs. Each strain induced robust serum and mucosal anti-S. dysenteriae 1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) responses and protected against wild-type challenge. Two strains engineered to overexpress StxB induced high titers of Shiga toxin neutralizing antibodies. These candidates demonstrate the potential for a live attenuated vaccine to protect against disease caused by S. dysenteriae 1 and potentially to protect against the toxic effects of other Shiga toxin 1-expressing pathogens.","['Wu T', 'Grassel C', 'Levine MM', 'Barry EM']",2011,79,12,Infect Immun,"Wu T, et al.

23409399,Shigellosis outbreak at Addis Ababa University: March-April 2010.,"BACKGROUND: Between 2006 and 2008, there have been various reports of diarrhea with blood in Ethiopia and also reports of Shigelloses outbreaks in some parts of the country. In March 2010, Addis Ababa University (AAU) Technology Campus reported occurrence of an outbreak of diarrheal illness among students.
OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to identify the causative agent and the possible source of the diarrhea outbreak that occurred at Technology Campus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Active case finding and review of medical records were undertaken to characterize the outbreak. The investigation consisted of a case-control study with laboratory testing and environmental assessment. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were analyzed using Epi-info (v3.3.2).
RESULTS: A total of 104 suspected cases were identified, based on the case definition, with an attack rate of 6.8%. Stool culture confirmed Shigella flexneri species in 5/11 (45%) of specimens tested. Risk factors associated with illness included eating specific foods at specific meal times. Food items served on Friday March 26, at lunch time (OR: 3.59, CI: 1.0- 12.7, p = 0.04) and on Saturday March 27, during dinner (OR: 2.89 CI: 1.0- 8.2, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with increased odds of illness. Water stored in a tank in the cafeteria had evidence of fecal contamination (fecal coliform count > 161 Mpn /100ml) and the hygiene and sanitary conditions in the cafeteria, kitchen, living area were unsatisfactory.
CONCLUSION: Food-borne transmission and water contamination were suspected as the sources of infection. Regular supervision and inspection of the campus' food handling facilities and practices were recommended to improve food hygiene and sanitation. Improved water storage, correcting periodic water shortages in the latrine facility and promotion of hand washing could reduce potential future outbreaks.","['Aragaw M', 'Tafese T', 'Beyene Z', 'Hailemariam Z', 'Azaze A', 'Luce R', 'Addissie A']",2011,49,4,Ethiop Med J,"Aragaw M, et al.

21934107,Shigella flexneri infection generates the lipid PI5P to alter endocytosis and prevent termination of EGFR signaling.,"The phosphoinositide metabolic pathway, which regulates cellular processes implicated in survival, motility, and trafficking, is often subverted by bacterial pathogens. Shigella flexneri, a bacterium that causes dysentery, injects IpgD, a phosphoinositide phosphatase that generates the lipid phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), into host cells, thereby activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt survival pathway. We show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is required for PI5P-dependent activation of Akt in infected HeLa cells or cells ectopically expressing IpgD. Cells treated with PI5P had increased numbers of early endosomes with activated EGFR, no detectable EGFR in the late endosomal or lysosomal compartments, and prolonged EGFR signaling. Endosomal recycling and retrograde pathways were spared, indicating that the effect of PI5P on the degradative route to the late endocytic compartments was specific. Thus, we identified PI5P, which was enriched in endosomes, as a regulator of vesicular trafficking that alters growth factor receptor signaling by impairing lysosomal degradation, a property used by S. flexneri to favor survival of host cells.","['Ramel D', 'Lagarrigue F', 'Pons V', 'Mounier J', 'Dupuis-Coronas S', 'Chicanne G', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Gaits-Iacovoni F', 'Tronchère H', 'Payrastre B']",2011,4,191,Sci Signal,"Ramel D, et al.

21911022,Mucosal immunization with Shigella flexneri outer membrane vesicles induced protection in mice.,"Vaccination appears to be the only rational prophylactic approach to control shigellosis. Unfortunately, there is still no safe and efficacious vaccine available. We investigated the protection conferred by a new vaccine containing outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from Shigella flexneri with an adjuvant based on nanoparticles in an experimental model of shigellosis in mice. OMVs were encapsulated in poly(anhydride) nanoparticles prepared by a solvent displacement method with the copolymer PMV/MA. OMVs loaded into NPs (NP-OMVs) were homogeneous and spherical in shape, with a size of 197nm (PdI=0.06). BALB/c mice (females, 9-week-old, 20±1g) were immunized by intradermal, nasal, ocular (20μg) or oral route (100μg) with free or encapsulated OMV. Thirty-five days after administration, mice were infected intranasally with a lethal dose of S. flexneri (1×10(7)CFU). The new vaccine was able to protect fully against infection when it was administered via mucosa. By intradermal route the NP-OMVs formulation increased the protection from 20%, obtained with free extract, to 100%. Interestingly, both OMVs and OMV-NP induced full protection when administered by the nasal and conjuntival route. A strong association between the ratio of IL-12p40/IL-10 and protection was found. Moreover, low levels of IFN-γ correlate with protection. Under the experimental conditions used, the adjuvant did not induce any adverse effects. These results place OMVs among promising candidates to be used for vaccination against Shigellosis.","['Camacho AI', 'de Souza J', 'Sánchez-Gómez S', 'Pardo-Ros M', 'Irache JM', 'Gamazo C']",2011,29,46,Vaccine,"Camacho AI, et al.

21905580,Shigellosis with resultant septic shock and renal failure.,"Septic shock is a rare, potentially life-threatening complication of bacterial dysentery. The clinical presentation of septic shock includes hypotension, bleeding, hypoxia, acidosis, and jaundice. Historically gram-negative organisms were the most frequent cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. However isolation of gram-positive organisms has become increasingly frequent with Staphylococcus species accounting for over one half of all nosocomial bloodstream pathogens. Bacterial dysentery is an acute diarrheal illness characterized by abdominal cramping, fever, and the production of mucoid, bloody stools. Laboratory findings include positive stool culture and increased leukocytes in direct fecal exam. Chemistry and hematology values may be abnormal. The disease is usually self-limiting but administration of antibiotics and rehydration therapy may be warranted in severe cases. This case study describes a 53 year old male who presented with diarrhea and diabetic acidosis and subsequently developed respiratory distress and renal failure due to shigellosis. Discussion of disease pathogenesis and treatment are provided.","['Moralez EI', 'Lofland D']",2011,24,3,Clin Lab Sci,Moralez EI and Lofland D.

This classification does not reflect genetic relatedness; in fact, Shigella species are so related to Escherichia coli , they should be classified as one distinctive species in the genus Escherichia. The differentiation of Shigella and E. coli is even more complicated with the description of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC). EIEC are strains that possess some of the biochemical characteristics of E. coli and have the ability to cause dysentery using the same method of invasion as Shigella does. Sequencing of multiple housekeeping genes indicates that EIEC is more related to Shigella than to non-invasive E. coli. Shigella and EIEC evolved from the same ancestor and form a single pathovar within E. coli. Shigella and EIEC could be separated from other E. coli by a PCR targeting the ipaH-gene; this is a multicopy gene exclusively found in all Shigella and EIEC. It is possible to differentiate Shigella and all E. coli, including EIEC, by using multiple tests, including ipaH-gene PCR, physiological and biochemical typing and serological typing.

It produces potent toxin termed Shiga toxin which is listed in category B biological warfare agent of CDC, USA. Earlier we have reported production of recombinant Shiga toxin B subunit that produced antibodies which neutralized Shiga toxin toxicity in HeLa cells. In the present study, we have evaluated the immunomodulatory potential of rStxB protein in Balb/c mice using Freunds adjuvants. Animal protection with recombinant StxB was conferred through both humoral and cellular immune responses as indicated by an increased antibody titre with predominance of IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes along with elevated levels of IgG1 subtype. Cytokine profile of the mice antiserum and splenocyte also indicates Th2 and Th1 type of immune responses where former dominates in early stage of immunization. Histopathology study of kidneys of vaccinated mice showed remarkable differences when compared to the animals infected with Shigella dysenteriae type1. The present study indicates that recombinant StxB is a promising vaccine candidate and can be used for production of therapeutic antibodies to counter Shiga intoxication.","['Gupta P', 'Singh MK', 'Singh Y', 'Gautam V', 'Kumar S', 'Kumar O', 'Dhaked RK']",2011,29,45,Vaccine,"Gupta P, et al.

We have applied SNP discovery and analysis for distinguishing each of the four Shigella serogroups (Boydii, Dysenteriae, Flexneri, and Sonnei) and for discriminating individual strains within the same serogroup by using 24 SNPs selected from nine genes. Five SNPs were identified from sequence analysis of two housekeeping genes (gapA and thrB) used previously in our lab to differentiate Shigella isolates into distinct lineages. The remaining 19 SNPs were identified by in silico analyses of eight Shigella genomes and are within the genes lpxC, sanA, yaaH, ybaP, ygaZ, yhbO, and ynhA. A total of 118 Shigella strains comprising 20 Boydii, 29 Dysenteriae, 42 Flexneri, and 27 Sonnei isolates were analyzed using the SNP typing scheme reported here. The combination of the 24 SNPs resulted in the identification of 26 SNP genotypes among the four Shigella serogroups and also provided some discriminatory resolution among individual strains within the same serogroup. The SNPs presented here should prove useful in identifying Shigella using PCR amplification and rapid sequence typing strategies.","['Hayford AE', 'Mammel MK', 'Lacher DW', 'Brown EW']",2011,11,7,Infect Genet Evol,"Hayford AE, et al.

21837926,"Epidemiology and outcome of Shigella, Salmonella and Campylobacter infections in travellers returning from the tropics with fever and diarrhoea.","INTRODUCTION: During a study on fever after a stay in the tropics, we aimed at investigating the epidemiology and outcome of invasive bacterial enteritis due to Shigella, Salmonella or Campylobacter spp. in patients diagnosed with febrile traveller's diarrhoea.
METHODS: From April 2000 to September 2006, we evaluated prospectively 594 travellers presenting with fever and diarrhoea within a month after a stay in the tropics. Patients not found with a systemic infection were assumed to have febrile traveller's diarrhoea (TD). Invasive bacterial enteritis was confirmed by isolation of Shigella, Campylobacter or nontyphoidal Salmonella in stool cultures.
RESULTS: Systemic infections (mainly malaria) were diagnosed in 259 (44%) evaluated travellers. Invasive bacterial enteritis, either alone or with another infection, was confirmed in 114 (34%) of the 335 remaining patients with febrile TD. Aetiologies were distributed between Campylobacter jejuni (47, 41%), Shigella spp. (43, 38%), Salmonella spp. (22, 19%) and mixed Campylobacter-Salmonella infection (2, 2%). Invasive bacterial enteritis accounted for about a third of febrile TD cases occurring after a stay in sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa/Middle East or Latin America, and for half of those occurring after a travel to southern Asia (including 33% only due to C. jejuni). Resistance to fluoroquinolones was exclusively observed in C. jejuni isolates, but at an overall rate of 53%. Clinical failure occurred in 33% of the patients with C. jejuni infection empirically treated with a fluoroquinolone.
CONCLUSION: Invasive bacterial enteritis was a frequent aetiology of febrile TD. C. jejuni was the leading pathogen after a travel to southern Asia, and was associated with high rate of resistance to fluoroquinolones and of clinical failure.","['Bottieau E', 'Clerinx J', 'Vlieghe E', 'Van Esbroeck M', 'Jacobs J', 'Van Gompel A', 'Van Den Ende J']",2011,66,3,Acta Clin Belg,"Bottieau E, et al.

21826486,Recovery and characterization of environmental variants of Shigella flexneri from surface water in Bangladesh.,"Little is known about the distribution, survival, and transmission of Shigella in environmental surface waters. To gain more insight into the environmental biology of Shigella we isolated five bacterial strains serotyped as Shigella flexneri 2b from a freshwater lake in Bangladesh using a modified nutrient broth supplemented with nucleic acid bases. The biochemical properties of the isolates, including inability to ferment lactose and a negative lysine decarboxylase test, indicated common physiological characteristics with Shigella, but differed significantly from that of standard clinical strains. The isolates possessed the ipaH virulence gene and a megaplasmid, but lacked other Shigella-related virulence marker genes. Genetic fingerprinting and sequence analysis of housekeeping genes confirmed the strains as S. flexneri isolates. An apparent clonal origin of strains recovered with a one-year interval indicates a strong environmental selection pressure on Shigella for persistence in the freshwater environment. The lack of a complete set of virulence genes as well as uncommon biochemical properties suggest that these strains might represent a group of non-invasive and atypical environmental Shigella variants, with the potential for further elucidation of the survival mechanism, diversity, and emergence of virulent Shigella in tropical freshwater environments.","['Rahman MZ', 'Azmuda N', 'Hossain MJ', 'Sultana M', 'Khan SI', 'Birkeland NK']",2011,63,4,Curr Microbiol,"Rahman MZ, et al.

KEY RESULTS: In the present study MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the purified 34 kDa OMP of Shigella flexneri 2a shows considerable sequence homology (Identity 65%) with the OmpA of S. flexneri 2a. By using the specific primers, the gene of interest has been amplified from S. flexneri 2a (N.Y-962/92) genomic DNA, cloned in pET100/D-TOPO® vector and expressed using induction with isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) for the first time. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the recombinant OmpA has been evaluated in an intranasally immunized murine pulmonary model. The recombinant protein induces significantly enhanced protein specific IgG and IgA Abs in both mucosal and systemic compartments and IgA secreting cells in the systemic compartment (spleen). The mice immunized with OmpA have been protected completely from systemic challenge with a lethal dose of virulent S. flexneri 2a. Immunization with the protein causes mild polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration in the lung, without inducing the release of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the OmpA of S. flexneri 2a can be an efficacious mucosal immunogen inducing protective immune responses. Our findings also demonstrate that antibodies and Th1 immune response may be associated with the marked protective efficacy of immunized mice after intranasal shigellae infection.","['Pore D', 'Mahata N', 'Pal A', 'Chakrabarti MK']",2011,6,7,PLoS One,"Pore D, et al.

21802793,[Waterborne outbreak of Shigella sonnei caused by consumption of public supply water].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate a waterborne outbreak in the population of València d'Àneu (Lleida, Spain).
METHODS: A cohort study of consumption of mains water, bottled water and spring water was carried out. The sample was obtained by telephone contact with all private numbers in the municipality. We surveyed 58.3% of the population census (105/180) for water consumption, number of glasses drunk daily and symptoms. The water supply in the municipal system was sampled, and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae in the stool samples of 10 patients was determined. The association of each type of water was studied with estimation of relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: The overall attack rate was 64.8% (68/105). The epidemic curve was consistent with an exposure of 6 days. Consumption of public supply water was associated with gastroenteritis (RR=4.2, 95% CI: 1.5-11.9). In addition, a dose-response relationship was found (χ(2)=34.1; p <0.001). There was a higher risk of illness in consumers of 2-3 glasses per day (RR=4.3; CI 95%: 1.9-9.9) and in those drinking more than three glasses per day (RR=4.9; 95% CI: 2.2 -10.9). The chlorinator of mains water froze and stopped working. Six stool cultures were positive for Shigella sonnei.

METHODS: The preliminary phytochemical screening was performed by the standard methods as described by Harborne. Cold extraction method was employed to extract the bioactive compounds from mango seed kernel. Disc diffusion method was adopted to screen antibacterial activity. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated by agar dilution method. The crude extracts were partially purified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and the fractions were analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) to identify the bioactive compounds.
RESULTS: Phytochemical scrutiny of M. indica indicated the presence of phytochemical constituents such as alkaloids, gums, flavanoids, phenols, saponins, steroids, tannins and xanthoproteins. Antibacterial activity was observed in two crude extracts and various fractions viz. hexane, benzene, chloroform, methanol and water. MIC of methanol fraction was found to be (95±11.8) μg/mL. MIC of other fractions ranged from 130-380 μg/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed that each crude extracts and fractions of M. indica have significant antimicrobial activity against the isolated pathogen S. dysenteriae. The antibacterial activity may be due to the phytochemical constituents of the mango seed kernel. The phytochemical tannin could be the reason for its antibacterial activity.","['Rajan S', 'Thirunalasundari T', 'Jeeva S']",2011,4,4,Asian Pac J Trop Med,"Rajan S, et al.

21752864,Lipopolysaccharide core structures and their correlation with genetic groupings of Shigella strains. A novel core variant in Shigella boydii type 16.,"Bacteria Shigella, the cause of shigellosis, evolved from the intestinal bacteria Escherichia coli. Based on structurally diverse O-specific polysaccharide chains of the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs; O-antigens), three from four Shigella species are subdivided into multiple serotypes. The central oligosaccharide of the LPS called core is usually conserved within genus but five core types called R1-R4 and K-12 have been recognized in E. coli. Structural data on the Shigella core are limited to S. sonnei, S. flexneri and one S. dysenteriae strain, which all share E. coli core types. In this work, we elucidated the core structure in 14 reference strains of S. dysenteriae and S. boydii. Core oligosaccharides were obtained by mild acid hydrolysis of the LPSs and studied using sugar analysis, high-resolution mass spectrometry and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The R1, R3 and R4 E. coli core types were identified in 8, 3 and 2 Shigella strains, respectively. A novel core variant found in S. boydii type 16 differs from the R3 core in the lack of GlcNAc and the presence of a D-glycero-D-manno-heptose disaccharide extension. In addition, the structure of an oligosaccharide consisting of the core and one O-antigen repeat was determined in S. dysenteriae type 8. A clear correlation of the core type was observed with genetic grouping of Shigella strains but not with their traditional division to four species. This finding supports a notion on the existing Shigella species as invalid taxa and a suggestion of multiple independent origins of Shigella from E. coli clones.","['Knirel YA', 'Kondakova AN', 'Vinogradov E', 'Lindner B', 'Perepelov AV', 'Shashkov AS']",2011,21,10,Glycobiology,"Knirel YA, et al.

21719574,Natural products modulate Shigella-host-cell interaction.,"This study focused on identifying possible new options derived from natural sources for the treatment of bacterial infections. Several natural products were investigated for their potential in modulating Shigella-host-cell interactions. The proliferation of Shigella sonnei was effectively inhibited inside HEp-2 cells in the presence of 4-methoxycinnamic acid and propolin D. Propolin D also significantly reduced the apoptosis of infected macrophage-like U937 cells and moderately reduced the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, which probably resulted from the inhibition of invasion plasmid antigen B secretion by this compound. Further characterization showed that propolin D did not prevent escape of Shigella from phagocytic vacuoles, as evidenced by actin-based motility and by the fact that addition of chloroquine did not further reduce the number of intracellular c.f.u. The role of propolin D in modulating autophagy could not be established under the experimental conditions used. As these compounds had no direct anti-Shigella activity in vitro, it was concluded that these compounds modulated Shigella-host-cell interactions by targeting yet-to-be defined mechanisms that provide benefits to host cells.","['Xu D', 'Saeed A', 'Wang Y', 'Seidel V', 'Sandström G', 'Yu J']",2011,60,Pt 11,J Med Microbiol,"Xu D, et al.

21702961,"In vivo versus in vitro protein abundance analysis of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 reveals changes in the expression of proteins involved in virulence, stress and energy metabolism.","BACKGROUND: Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 (SD1) causes the most severe form of epidemic bacillary dysentery. Quantitative proteome profiling of Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 (SD1) in vitro (derived from LB cell cultures) and in vivo (derived from gnotobiotic piglets) was performed by 2D-LC-MS/MS and APEX, a label-free computationally modified spectral counting methodology.
RESULTS: Overall, 1761 proteins were quantitated at a 5% FDR (false discovery rate), including 1480 and 1505 from in vitro and in vivo samples, respectively. Identification of 350 cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane (OM) proteins (38% of in silico predicted SD1 membrane proteome) contributed to the most extensive survey of the Shigella membrane proteome reported so far. Differential protein abundance analysis using statistical tests revealed that SD1 cells switched to an anaerobic energy metabolism under in vivo conditions, resulting in an increase in fermentative, propanoate, butanoate and nitrate metabolism. Abundance increases of transcription activators FNR and Nar supported the notion of a switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration in the host gut environment. High in vivo abundances of proteins involved in acid resistance (GadB, AdiA) and mixed acid fermentation (PflA/PflB) indicated bacterial survival responses to acid stress, while increased abundance of oxidative stress proteins (YfiD/YfiF/SodB) implied that defense mechanisms against oxygen radicals were mobilized. Proteins involved in peptidoglycan turnover (MurB) were increased, while β-barrel OM proteins (OmpA), OM lipoproteins (NlpD), chaperones involved in OM protein folding pathways (YraP, NlpB) and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (Imp) were decreased, suggesting unexpected modulations of the outer membrane/peptidoglycan layers in vivo. Several virulence proteins of the Mxi-Spa type III secretion system and invasion plasmid antigens (Ipa proteins) required for invasion of colonic epithelial cells, and release of bacteria into the host cell cytosol were increased in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Global proteomic profiling of SD1 comparing in vivo vs. in vitro proteomes revealed differential expression of proteins geared towards survival of the pathogen in the host gut environment, including increased abundance of proteins involved in anaerobic energy respiration, acid resistance and virulence. The immunogenic OspC2, OspC3 and IpgA virulence proteins were detected solely under in vivo conditions, lending credence to their candidacy as potential vaccine targets.","['Kuntumalla S', 'Zhang Q', 'Braisted JC', 'Fleischmann RD', 'Peterson SN', 'Donohue-Rolfe A', 'Tzipori S', 'Pieper R']",2011,11,,BMC Microbiol,"Kuntumalla S, et al.

21676249,Diarrheal disease risk in rural Bangladesh decreases as tubewell density increases: a zero-inflated and geographically weighted analysis.,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the impact of tubewell user density on cholera and shigellosis events in Matlab, Bangladesh between 2002 and 2004. Household-level demographic, health, and water infrastructure data were incorporated into a local geographic information systems (GIS) database. Geographically-weighted regression (GWR) models were constructed to identify spatial variation of relationships across the study area. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were run to simultaneously measure the likelihood of increased magnitude of disease events and the likelihood of zero cholera or shigellosis events. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tubewell density on both the occurrence of diarrheal disease and the magnitude of diarrheal disease incidence.
RESULTS: In Matlab, households with greater tubewell density were more likely to report zero cholera or shigellosis events. Results for both cholera and shigellosis GWR models suggest that tubewell density effects are spatially stationary and the use of non-spatial statistical methods is appropriate.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the amount of drinking water available to households through increased density of tubewells contributed to lower reports of cholera and shigellosis events in rural Bangladesh. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tubewell installation and access to groundwater in reducing diarrheal disease events in the developing world.","['Carrel M', 'Escamilla V', 'Messina J', 'Giebultowicz S', 'Winston J', 'Yunus M', 'Streatfield PK', 'Emch M']",2011,10,,Int J Health Geogr,"Carrel M, et al.

21673991,Phenylbutyrate counteracts Shigella mediated downregulation of cathelicidin in rabbit lung and intestinal epithelia: a potential therapeutic strategy.,"BACKGROUND: Cathelicidins and defensins are endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are downregulated in the mucosal epithelia of the large intestine in shigellosis. Oral treatment of Shigella infected rabbits with sodium butyrate (NaB) reduces clinical severity and counteracts the downregulation of cathelicidin (CAP-18) in the large intestinal epithelia.
AIMS: To develop novel regimen for treating infectious diseases by inducing innate immunity, we selected sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PB), a registered drug for a metabolic disorder as a potential therapeutic candidate in a rabbit model of shigellosis. Since acute respiratory infections often cause secondary complications during shigellosis, the systemic effect of PB and NaB on CAP-18 expression in respiratory epithelia was also evaluated.
METHODS: The readouts were clinical outcomes, CAP-18 expression in mucosa of colon, rectum, lung and trachea (immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR) and release of the CAP-18 peptide/protein in stool (Western blot).
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Significant downregulation of CAP-18 expression in the epithelia of rectum and colon, the site of Shigella infection was confirmed. Interestingly, reduced expression of CAP-18 was also noticed in the epithelia of lung and trachea, indicating a systemic effect of the infection. This suggests a causative link to acute respiratory infections during shigellosis. Oral treatment with PB resulted in reduced clinical illness and upregulation of CAP-18 in the epithelium of rectum. Both PB and NaB counteracted the downregulation of CAP-18 in lung epithelium. The drug effect is suggested to be systemic as intravenous administration of NaB could also upregulate CAP-18 in the epithelia of lung, rectum and colon.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that PB has treatment potential in human shigellosis. Enhancement of CAP-18 in the mucosal epithelia of the respiratory tract by PB or NaB is a novel discovery. This could mediate protection from secondary respiratory infections that frequently are the lethal causes in dysentery.","['Sarker P', 'Ahmed S', 'Tiash S', 'Rekha RS', 'Stromberg R', 'Andersson J', 'Bergman P', 'Gudmundsson GH', 'Agerberth B', 'Raqib R']",2011,6,6,PLoS One,"Sarker P, et al.

ATP released through connexin hemichanels on the epithelial membrane stimulates Shigella invasion and dissemination in epithelial cells. Here, we show that prior to contact with the cell body, Shigella is captured by nanometer-thin micropodial extensions (NMEs) at a distance from the cell surface, in a process involving the T3SS tip complex proteins and stimulated by ATP- and connexin-mediated signaling. Upon bacterial contact, NMEs retract, bringing bacteria in contact with the cell body, where invasion occurs. ATP stimulates Erk1/2 activation, which controls actin retrograde flow in NMEs and their retraction. These findings reveal previously unappreciated facets of interaction of an invasive bacterium with host cells and a prominent role for Erk1/2 in the control of filopodial dynamics.","['Romero S', 'Grompone G', 'Carayol N', 'Mounier J', 'Guadagnini S', 'Prevost MC', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Van Nhieu GT']",2011,9,6,Cell Host Microbe,"Romero S, et al.

21646350,p62 and NDP52 proteins target intracytosolic Shigella and Listeria to different autophagy pathways.,"Autophagy is an important mechanism of innate immune defense. We have recently shown that autophagy components are recruited with septins, a new and increasingly characterized cytoskeleton component, to intracytosolic Shigella that have started to polymerize actin. On the other hand, intracytosolic Listeria avoids autophagy recognition by expressing ActA, a bacterial effector required for actin polymerization. Here, we exploit Shigella and Listeria as intracytosolic tools to characterize different pathways of selective autophagy. We show that the ubiquitin-binding adaptor proteins p62 and NDP52 target Shigella to an autophagy pathway dependent upon septin and actin. In contrast, p62 or NDP52 targets the Listeria ActA mutant to an autophagy pathway independent of septin or actin. TNF-α, a host cytokine produced upon bacterial infection, stimulates p62-mediated autophagic activity and restricts the survival of Shigella and the Listeria ActA mutant. These data provide a new molecular framework to understand the emerging complexity of autophagy and its ability to achieve specific clearance of intracytosolic bacteria.","['Mostowy S', 'Sancho-Shimizu V', 'Hamon MA', 'Simeone R', 'Brosch R', 'Johansen T', 'Cossart P']",2011,286,30,J Biol Chem,"Mostowy S, et al. p62 and NDP52 proteins target intracytosolic Shigella and Listeria to different autophagy pathways. p62 and NDP52 proteins target intracytosolic Shigella and Listeria to different autophagy pathways. 2011; 286:26987-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.223610",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21646350/

21615433,"Prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants among clinical isolates of Shigella sp. in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, India.","AIMS: This study was carried out to find the prevalence of various plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistant (PMQR) determinants among the quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Shigella sp. from paediatric patients in Andaman & Nicobar Islands.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 106 quinolone-resistant Shigella isolates obtained from paediatric patients during hospital-based surveillance from January 2003 to June 2010 were screened for the presence of various PMQR determinants. Of 106 isolates, 8 (7.5%) showed the presence of aac (6')-Ib-cr and 3 (2.8%) harboured the qnrB genes with 2 (1.9%) of these isolates showing the presence of both. All the 9 isolates had uniform mutations in gyrA (S83L) and in parC (S80I).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fluoroquinolone-acetylating aminoglycoside acetyltransferase {aac (6')-Ib-cr} gene is higher than qnrB gene among the clinical Shigella isolates. These PMQR determinants were detected in the Shigella isolates obtained from 2008-2010, indicating that it happens in a stepwise manner following the multiple mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions increase or extend resistance to quinolones or fluoroquinolones.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The prevalence of these genes are of grave concern as it may be horizontally transferred to other human pathogenic bacteria and can lead to therapeutic failure as a consequence of antimicrobial resistance, not only for the islands but also for the entire south-east region. The results obtained should encourage further studies on the implications of the presence, distribution, association and variation of these determinants in our quest for understanding PMQR.","['Bhattacharya D', 'Bhattacharjee H', 'Thamizhmani R', 'Sayi DS', 'Bharadwaj AP', 'Singhania M', 'Sugunan AP', 'Roy S']",2011,53,2,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Bhattacharya D, et al.

Shigella sonnei live vaccine candidates WRSs2 and WRSs3 are attenuated principally by the loss of VirG(IcsA) that prevents bacterial spread within the colonic epithelium. In this respect they are similar to the clinically tested vaccine candidate WRSS1. However, WRSs2 and WRSs3 are further attenuated by loss of senA, senB and WRSs3 also lacks msbB2. As previously shown in cell culture assays and in small animal models, these additional gene deletions reduced the levels of enterotoxicity and endotoxicity of WRSs2 and WRSs3, potentially making them safer than WRSS1. However the behavior of these second-generation VirG(IcsA)-based vaccine candidates in eliciting an immune response in a gastrointestinal model of infection has not been evaluated. In this study, WRSs2 and WRSs3 were nasogastrically administered to rhesus monkeys that were evaluated for colonization, as well as for systemic and mucosal immune responses. Both vaccine candidates were safe in rhesus monkeys and behaved comparably to WRSS1 in bacterial excretion rates that demonstrated robust intestinal colonization. Furthermore, humoral and mucosal immune responses elicited against bacterial antigens appeared similar in all categories across all three strains indicating that the additional gene deletions did not compromise the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates. Based on data from previous clinical trials with WRSS1, it is likely that, WRSs2 and WRSs3 will not only be safer in human volunteers but will generate comparable levels of systemic and mucosal immune responses that were achieved with WRSS1.","['Barnoy S', 'Baqar S', 'Kaminski RW', 'Collins T', 'Nemelka K', 'Hale TL', 'Ranallo RT', 'Venkatesan MM']",2011,29,37,Vaccine,"Barnoy S, et al.

Here, we describe a successful experimental shigellosis in the guinea-pig model, which has shown the characteristic features of human shigellosis. This model yielded reproducible results without any preparatory treatment besides cecal ligation. In this study, guinea-pigs were discretely infected with virulent Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and Shigella flexneri type 2a into the cecocolic junction after ligation of the distal cecum. All the experimental animals lost ∼10% of their body weight and developed typical dysentery within 24-h postinfection. In the histological analysis, distal colon showed edema, hemorrhage, exudation and inflammatory infiltrations in the lamina propria. Orally immunized animals with heat-killed S. dysenteriae type 1 and S. flexneri type 2a strains showed high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA antibodies and conferred significant homologous protective immunity against subsequent challenges with the live strains. The direct administration of shigellae into the cecocolic junction induces acute inflammation, making this animal model useful for assessing shigellosis and evaluating the protective immunity of Shigella vaccine candidates.","['Barman S', 'Saha DR', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Koley H']",2011,62,3,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,"Barman S, et al.

21525010,Novel vinculin binding site of the IpaA invasin of Shigella.,"Internalization of Shigella into host epithelial cells, where the bacteria replicates and spreads to neighboring cells, requires a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) effector coined IpaA. IpaA binds directly to and activates the cytoskeletal protein vinculin after injection in the host cell cytosol, and this was previously thought to be directed by two amphipathic α-helical vinculin-binding sites (VBS) found in the C-terminal tail domain of IpaA. Here, we report a third VBS, IpaA-VBS3, that is located N-terminal to the other two VBSs of IpaA and show that one IpaA molecule can bind up to three vinculin molecules. Biochemical in vitro Shigella invasion assays and the 1.6 Å crystal structure of the vinculin·IpaA-VBS3 complex showed that IpaA-VBS3 is functionally redundant with the other two IpaA-VBSs in cell invasion and in activating the latent F-actin binding functions of vinculin. Multiple VBSs in IpaA are reminiscent of talin, which harbors 11 VBSs. However, most of the talin VBSs have low affinity and are buried in helix bundles, whereas all three of the VBSs of IpaA are high affinity, readily available, and in close proximity to each other in the IpaA structure. Although deletion of IpaA-VBS3 has no detectable effects on Shigella invasion of epithelial cells, deletion of all three VBSs impaired bacterial invasion to levels found in an ipaA null mutant strain. Thus, IpaA-directed mimicry of talin in activating vinculin occurs through three high affinity VBSs that are essential for Shigella pathogenesis.","['Park H', 'Valencia-Gallardo C', 'Sharff A', 'Tran Van Nhieu G', 'Izard T']",2011,286,26,J Biol Chem,"Park H, et al.

21483688,An integrated approach for finding overlooked genes in Shigella.,"BACKGROUND: The completion of numerous genome sequences introduced an era of whole-genome study. However, many genes are missed during genome annotation, including small RNAs (sRNAs) and small open reading frames (sORFs). In order to improve genome annotation, we aimed to identify novel sRNAs and sORFs in Shigella, the principal etiologic agents of bacillary dysentery.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified 64 sRNAs in Shigella, which were experimentally validated in other bacteria based on sequence conservation. We employed computer-based and tiling array-based methods to search for sRNAs, followed by RT-PCR and northern blots, to identify nine sRNAs in Shigella flexneri strain 301 (Sf301) and 256 regions containing possible sRNA genes. We found 29 candidate sORFs using bioinformatic prediction, array hybridization and RT-PCR verification. We experimentally validated 557 (57.9%) DOOR operon predictions in the chromosomes of Sf301 and 46 (76.7%) in virulence plasmid.We found 40 additional co-expressed gene pairs that were not predicted by DOOR.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We provide an updated and comprehensive annotation of the Shigella genome. Our study increased the expected numbers of sORFs and sRNAs, which will impact on future functional genomics and proteomics studies. Our method can be used for large scale reannotation of sRNAs and sORFs in any microbe with a known genome sequence.","['Peng J', 'Yang J', 'Jin Q']",2011,6,4,PLoS One,"Peng J, et al.

This review describes emerging monophasic variants of Salmonella enterica serotype 1,4,[5],12:i:- and provides an evolutionary consideration of Shigella spp.-EIEC as a single pathotype. In 1997, a monophasic variant of S. enterica serotype 1,4,[5],12:i:-, phage-type U302, multidrug resistant (ACGSSuTSxT), lacking the fljBA operon, appeared in Spain constituting a ""Spanish"" clonal line. Subsequently, strains of S. 4[5],12:i:-, of different phage types with a new resistance genomic island (ASSuT) were detected in Italy, forming part of a European clonal line. Finally, an ""American"" clonal line with a deletion of fljBA different from the Spanish clonal line appeared. Therefore, probably by convergent evolution, different clonal lines of Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i:-, which can carry resistance genes on chromosomes or plasmids, with Salmonella Typhimurium as ancestor, have emerged in the world. Although Shigella belongs to the E. coli species and despite the biological inconsistency involved, this genus has traditionally been considered to cause bacillary dysentery. The EIEC group shares virulence mechanisms and clinical manifestations with Shigella. Both lack some metabolic genes and harbor similar plasmids of invasion. Shigella spp. and EIEC evolved from independent clonal lines of E. coli, by horizontal acquisition of virulence factors, forming a single pathotype.

21446148,[Shigellosis--epidemiological situation in Montenegro in period 1996-2005].,"UNLABELLED: INTRODUCTION Shigellosis is the most common cause of diarrhoea in the world. It is estimated to cause 165 million cases per a year, and two third of all diseases and most of the deaths are among children under 10 years of age. The aim of this descriptive epidemiologic study was to analyze the incidence of shigellosis in Montenegro during the period 1996-2005 and to find out which species of Shigella were dominant in this region.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the analysis of the data we used crude, age-specific and standardized incidence rates calculated by direct method using world population by Segi as standard.
RESULTS: During the study period the average participation of shigellosis among all cases of intestinal diseases expressed in percentage was 1.2%. The average standardized incidence rate for shigellosis was 7.18/100.000 in male population and 6.3/100.000 in female population. During the period 1996-2005 the number of Shigella cases decreased both in male and female population. Most of the cases were among children aged 0-14, and then in the age group 15-24 years. The most common species were S. sonnei (46.1%), then S. flexnery (25.4%), S. boydi (10.9%) and S. dysenteriae (3.6%).
DISCUSSION: Today shigellosis is still a big health problem in most countries because of high mortality rate among children, the presence of multi-resistant species to antibiotics, easy transmission from one person to another and lack of preventive measures, especially vaccine.
CONCLUSION: In order to decrease the incidence of shigellosis it is necessary to apply appropriate preventive measures as well as to improve vaccine against this disease.","['Sipetić-Grujicić S', 'Glusac S', 'Ratkov I', 'Maksimović J', 'Ratkov E', 'Rakocević B']",2010,63,7-8,Med Pregl,"Sipetić-Grujicić S, et al.

METHODOLOGY: A total of 877 stool samples were received for culture at the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), Kathmandu, Nepal, during January 2002 to December 2004, from diarrhoea patients attending Shukraraj Tropical Infectious Hospital and referral outpatients. All samples collected were processed for isolation and antibiotic susceptibility testing of Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.
RESULTS: Of the 877 stool samples, 148 (16.8%) were culture positive for one of the three bacterial enteropathogens investigated. Among them, Vibrio cholerae, Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. accounted for 98/877 (11.1%), 41/877 (4.6%), 9/877 (1.02%) of the isolates respectively. A year-to-year variation was seen in the type of predominant organism, with Shigella spp. being the most prevalent in 2002 and 2003 and Vibrio spp. in 2004. In all three years, Vibrio cholerae were encountered only during the months of April to June while Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were isolated throughout the whole year. All Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.  All Shigella isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Ciprofloxacin resistance was observed among isolates of Shigella dysenteriae type-1 isolated after 2003.
CONCLUSION: Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella and Shigella infections are prevalent in Kathmandu, Nepal. A gradual increase in resistance to commonly used antimicrobials was seen among bacterial enteropathogens. Antimicrobial resistance surveillance is necessary to guide empirical treatment.","['Kansakar P', 'Baral P', 'Malla S', 'Ghimire GR']",2011,5,3,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Kansakar P, et al.

DC (Leguminosae) has been used to treat febrile diseases, rheumatic arthritis, and bacillary dysentery; nevertheless, there have been no reports on the analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects of this plant in animals.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities of D. caudatum extract (DCE) in animals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analgesic effect of DCE was measured in mice using the acetic acid-induced writhing test and the hot-plate test. The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model and the dimethylbenzene-induced mouse inflammation model. The antipyretic effect was estimated using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced rat fever model. In addition, the acute oral toxicity of DCE was studied.
RESULTS: DCE significantly and dose-dependently inhibited the writhing responses in mice, increased reaction time in mice in the hot-plate test, reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and the dimethylbenzene-induced ear edema in mice, and attenuated LPS-induced fever in rats. Furthermore, no death was observed when mice were orally administered DCE up to 40 g/kg.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: DCE possesses evident analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities, and has a favorable safety, which supports the use of D. caudatum as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug in folk medicine.","['Ma KJ', 'Zhu ZZ', 'Yu CH', 'Zhang H', 'Liu J', 'Qin LP']",2011,49,4,Pharm Biol,"Ma KJ, et al.

21402152,Shigella flexneri type III secreted effector OspF reveals new crosstalks of proinflammatory signaling pathways during bacterial infection.,"Shigella flexneri type III secreted effector OspF harbors a phosphothreonine lyase activity that irreversibly dephosphorylates MAP kinases (MAPKs) p38 and ERK in infected epithelial cells and thereby, dampens innate immunity. Whereas this activity has been well characterized, the impact of OspF on other host signaling pathways that control inflammation was unknown. Here we report that OspF potentiates the activation of the MAPK JNK and the transcription factor NF-κB during S. flexneri infection. This unexpected effect of OspF was dependent on the phosphothreonine lyase activity of OspF on p38, and resulted from the disruption of a negative feedback loop regulation between p38 and TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), mediated via the phosphorylation of TAK1-binding protein 1. Interestingly, potentiated JNK activation was not associated with enhanced c-Jun signaling as OspF also inhibits c-Jun expression at the transcriptional level. Altogether, our data reveal the impact of OspF on the activation of NF-κB, JNK and c-Jun, and demonstrate the existence of a negative feedback loop regulation between p38 and TAK1 during S. flexneri infection. Furthermore, this study validates the use of bacterial effectors as molecular tools to identify the crosstalks that connect important host signaling pathways induced upon bacterial infection.","['Reiterer V', 'Grossniklaus L', 'Tschon T', 'Kasper CA', 'Sorg I', 'Arrieumerlou C']",2011,23,7,Cell Signal,"Reiterer V, et al.

21368893,Gadd45α activity is the principal effector of Shigella mitochondria-dependent epithelial cell death in vitro and ex vivo.,"Modulation of death is a pathogen strategy to establish residence and promote survival in host cells and tissues. Shigella spp. are human pathogens that invade colonic mucosa, where they provoke lesions caused by their ability to manipulate the host cell responses. Shigella spp. induce various types of cell death in different cell populations. However, they are equally able to protect host cells from death. Here, we have investigated on the molecular mechanisms and cell effectors governing the balance between survival and death in epithelial cells infected with Shigella. To explore these aspects, we have exploited both, the HeLa cell invasion assay and a novel ex vivo human colon organ culture model of infection that mimics natural conditions of shigellosis. Our results definitely show that Shigella induces a rapid intrinsic apoptosis of infected cells, via mitochondrial depolarization and the ensuing caspase-9 activation. Moreover, for the first time we identify the eukaryotic stress-response factor growth arrest and DNA damage 45α as a key player in the induction of the apoptotic process elicited by Shigella in epithelial cells, revealing an unexplored role of this molecule in the course of infections sustained by invasive pathogens.","['Lembo-Fazio L', 'Nigro G', 'Noël G', 'Rossi G', 'Chiara F', 'Tsilingiri K', 'Rescigno M', 'Rasola A', 'Bernardini ML']",2011,2,2,Cell Death Dis,"Lembo-Fazio L, et al.

Strains of Shigella, Salmonella, Escherichia and Yersinia are responsible for diarrhea, severe bacillary dysentery, typhoid, other intestinal diseases, as well as genitourinary tract and blood infections. According to the WHO there are 4.5 billion cases every year, of which 1.9 million end in death. This makes intestinal infections third in terms of human disease mortality. In this work we discuss methods of pathogen identification, the mechanism of host-pathogen interaction, and the nature of the host's immunological response. Due to rising drug resistance we discuss the importance of better pathogen detection, vaccine design and the use of vaccines as a preventive measure against intestinal infections. Special attention is paid to OMP38, a protein isolated from S. flexneri 3a outer membrane. Since it is known that this protein has good immunogenic properties, it can be used as an antigen or carrier for conjugate vaccines.","['Jarząb A', 'Górska-Frączek S', 'Rybka J', 'Witkowska D']",2011,65,,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),"Jarząb A, et al.

21357720,Antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells fail to respond to Shigella flexneri.,"CD8(+) T lymphocytes often play a primary role in adaptive immunity to cytosolic microbial pathogens. Surprisingly, CD8(+) T cells are not required for protective immunity to the enteric pathogen Shigella flexneri, despite the ability of Shigella to actively secrete proteins into the host cytoplasm, a location from which antigenic peptides are processed for presentation to CD8(+) T cells. To determine why CD8(+) T cells fail to play a role in adaptive immunity to S. flexneri, we investigated whether antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells are primed during infection but are unable to confer protection or, alternatively, whether T cells fail to be primed. To test whether Shigella is capable of stimulating an antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell response, we created an S. flexneri strain that constitutively secretes a viral CD8(+) T-cell epitope via the Shigella type III secretion system and characterized the CD8(+) T-cell response to this strain both in mice and in cultured cells. Surprisingly, no T cells specific for the viral epitope were stimulated in mice infected with this strain, and cells infected with the recombinant strain were not targeted by epitope-specific T cells. Additionally, we found that the usually robust T-cell response to antigens artificially introduced into the cytoplasm of cultured cells was significantly reduced when the antigen-presenting cell was infected with Shigella. Collectively, these results suggest that antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells are not primed during S. flexneri infection and, as a result, afford little protection to the host during primary or subsequent infection.","['Jehl SP', 'Doling AM', 'Giddings KS', 'Phalipon A', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Goldberg MB', 'Starnbach MN']",2011,79,5,Infect Immun,"Jehl SP, et al.

From the last one-and-half decade, we have been monitoring the species distribution and emergence of antibiotic resistance among the isolates of Shigella. The circulating Shigella strains have been found rapidly acquiring resistance to a wide spectrum of antibiotics. The recent data indicate that a significant proportion of Shigella isolates have been resistant to newer generation of cephalosporins, which are used as an alternative of quinolones to treat the patients with shigellosis. In this communication, we report the antibiotic-resistant pattern of Shigella isolates that are recently isolated from these islands. From January 2008 to December 2009, 311 stool samples were processed and 44 (14%) Shigella isolates were recovered. Out of these 44 Shigella isolates, 6 (14%) were found to be resistant to all the three third-generation cephalosporins tested. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the resistant isolates were all above the breakpoint for reduced susceptibility as per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. All of the cephalosporin-resistant Shigella strains were confirmed to produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases. By analyzing trends in the resistance patterns of the various Shigella species, we found that Shigella dysenteriae (40%) is currently more resistant, followed by Shigella flexneri (14%), than the other Shigella species in these islands of India, especially to the third-generation cephalosporins. The acquisition of resistance by enteric pathogens to the increasing number of antibacterial drugs is becoming a grave concern, particularly in developing countries where shigellosis is of a common occurrence.","['Bhattacharya D', 'Purushottaman SA', 'Bhattacharjee H', 'Thamizhmani R', 'Sudharama SD', 'Manimunda SP', 'Bharadwaj AP', 'Singhania M', 'Roy S']",2011,17,2,Microb Drug Resist,"Bhattacharya D, et al.

Bacterial diarrhea has also emerged as a public health concern due to the proliferation of drug resistant species in many parts of the world. There is a paucity of population-based data about the incidence of shigellosis and Campylobacter infections in Pakistan. We report country specific results for Shigella diarrhea that were derived from a multicenter study conducted in six Asian countries. Disease surveillance was conducted over a 24 month period in urban slums of Karachi, Pakistan, a city with a population of 59,584. Cases were detected through passive detection in study treatment centers. Stool specimens or rectal swabs were collected from all consenting patients. Between January 2002 and December 2003 10,540 enteric infection cases were detected. The incidence rate of treated diarrhea in children under 5 was 488/1000/year. In children, 5 years and older, the diarrhea rate was 22/1000/year. 576 (7%) Campylobacter isolates were detected. The pre-dominant Campylobacter species was C. jenuni with an increase of 29/1000 year in children under 5 years. Shigella species were isolated from 394 of 8032 children under 5 years of age. Shigella flexneri was the dominant species (10/1000/year in children under 5 years) followed by Shigella sonnei (3.9/1000/year), Shigella boydii (2.0/1000/year) and Shigella dysenteriae (1.3/1000/year). Shigellosis and Campylobacter infection rates peaked during the second year of life. The incidence rate of shigellosis increased in old age but such a trend was not observed in Campylobacter infections. Of 394 shigellosis patients 123 (31%) presented with dysentery in contrast to only 54 (9%) of 576 patients with Campylobacter infections (p<0.001). Both Campylobacter infections and shigellosis are common in community settings of Pakistan but shigellosis presented more frequently with abdominal pain and dysentery than Campylobacter infections indicating that shigellosis may be a more severe illness than Campylobacter infections. Due to the increased and disease severity, drug resistant shigella have become a significant health problem; moreover it is a disease of poor and impoverished people who do not have the access to standard water and sanitary conditions, health care services or optimal treatment.

21337935,Use of hospital discharge data to evaluate notifiable disease reporting to Colorado's Electronic Disease Reporting System.,"OBJECTIVE: Notifiable disease surveillance systems are critical for communicable disease control, and accurate and timely reporting of hospitalized patients who represent the most severe cases is important. A local health department in metropolitan Denver used inpatient hospital discharge (IHD) data to evaluate the sensitivity, timeliness, and data quality of reporting eight notifiable diseases to the Colorado Electronic Disease Reporting System (CEDRS).
METHODS: Using IHD data, we detected hospitalized patients admitted from 2003 through 2005 with a discharge diagnosis associated with one of eight notifiable diseases. Initially, we compared all cases identified through IHD diagnoses fields with cases reported to CEDRS. Second, we chose four diseases and conducted medical record review to confirm the IHD diagnoses before comparison with CEDRS cases.
RESULTS: Relying on IHD diagnoses only, shigellosis, salmonellosis, and Neisseria meningitidis invasive disease had high sensitivity (> or = 90%) and timeliness (> or = 75%); legionellosis, pertussis, and West Nile virus infection were intermediate; and hepatitis A and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) invasive disease had low sensitivity (> or = 25%) and timeliness (< or = 33%). Medical record review improved the sensitivity to > or = 90% and timeliness to > or = 80% for H. influenza invasive disease, legionellosis, and pertussis; however, hepatitis A retained suboptimal sensitivity (67%) and timeliness (25%).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital discharge data are useful for evaluating notifiable disease surveillance systems. Limitations encountered by using discharge diagnoses alone can be overcome by conducting medical record review. Public health agencies should conduct periodic surveillance system evaluations among hospitalized patients and reinforce notifiable disease reporting among the people responsible for this activity.","['Boehmer TK', 'Patnaik JL', 'Burnite SJ', 'Ghosh TS', 'Gershman K', 'Vogt RL']",2011,126,1,Public Health Rep,"Boehmer TK, et al.

21283697,Isolation and partial characterisation of a novel lectin from Aegle marmelos fruit and its effect on adherence and invasion of Shigellae to HT29 cells.,"Lectins are a class of ubiquitous proteins/glycoproteins that are abundantly found in nature. Lectins have unique carbohydrate binding property and hence have been exploited as drugs against various infectious diseases. We have isolated one such novel lectin from the fruit pulp of Aegle marmelos. The isolated lectin was partially characterised and its effect against Shigella dysenteriae infection was evaluated. The isolated lectin was found to be a dimeric protein with N-acetylgalactosamine, mannose and sialic acid binding specificity. The effect of Aegle marmelos fruit lectin on the adherence of Shigella dysenteriae to human colonic epithelial cells (HT29 cells) was evaluated by Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay and invasion was analysed. The protective nature of the Aegle marmelos fruit lectin was assessed by analyzing apoptosis through dual staining method. Aegle marmelos fruit lectin significantly inhibited hemagglutination activity of Shigella and its minimum inhibitory concentration is 0.625 µg/well. Further, at this concentration lectin inhibited Shigella dysenteriae adherence and invasion of HT29 cells and protects the HT29 cells from Shigella dysenteriae induced apoptosis. To conclude, isolated lectin dimeric protein with N-acetylgalactosamine, Mannose and sialic acid binding specificity and inhibits adherence and invasion of Shigellae to HT29 cells thus, protects the host.","['Raja SB', 'Murali MR', 'Kumar NK', 'Devaraj SN']",2011,6,1,PLoS One,"Raja SB, et al.

21254954,Analysis of Shigella flexneri-mediated infections in model organism Caenorhabditis elegans.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and generates a significant global disease burden. The aim of this study was to analyze the pathogenesis and host immune response, at both the physiological and molecular level, using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, in response to S. flexneri. C. elegans is a nematode that responds to infection with a simple innate immune system, key aspects of which have been shown to be conserved.
METHODS: S. flexneri-mediated infection of C. elegans was performed in both solid and liquid assays. The expression and subsequent regulation of host candidate antimicrobial genes such as lysozymes, C-type lectins and pathogen virulence genes were kinetically analyzed in the S. flexneri-exposed nematode.
RESULTS: In solid assays, worms fed with S. flexneri showed complete killing at 153 ± 9 h. The kinetic studies showed that S. flexneri killed the worms upon continuous exposure at 41 ± 1.7 h. However, short-time exposure of the host to S. flexneri indicated that 14 h of exposure resulted in a loss of progeny, and death occurred after 46 h. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that mRNA levels of host candidate antimicrobial genes and pathogen virulence genes varied significantly at the time of early infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The killing of C. elegans requires live bacteria, and a minimal exposure time is sufficient for S. flexneri to have a lethal effect. The candidate antimicrobial genes and virulence genes are kinetically regulated within C. elegans during S. flexneri-mediated infections, thereby exhibiting their role and contribution in the host innate immune system.","['Kesika P', 'Karutha Pandian S', 'Balamurugan K']",2011,43,4,Scand J Infect Dis,"Kesika P, et al.

21196605,"""War dysentery"" and the limitations of German military hygiene during World War I.","This article examines major epidemics of bacillary dysentery in the German army as well as among civilians in eastern Europe and in Germany during World War I. These epidemics were all the more surprising in light of prewar advances in understanding the disease and limiting dysentery outbreaks. Three major reasons are adduced for the incapacity of German military hygienists to prevent wartime epidemics. First was the difficulty of bacteriological testing at the front, especially early in the war, with negative consequences for diagnosis, therapy, and disease control. Second was inadequate hygiene including major shortcomings in latrine cleanliness and attempts to grapple with the ""fly plague."" Third was the lack of a Pasteur-type vaccine until late in the war. Susceptibility to dysentery was also heightened by war-related nutritional deficiencies. Taking off from an article by the English medical historian Roger Cooter, this article shows that the concept of ""war dysentery"" was socially constructed and served a variety of professional interests but at the same time takes issue with Cooter's arguments against linking ""war"" and ""epidemics"" pathogenetically.",['Linton DS'],2010,84,4,Bull Hist Med,"Linton DS.

21194882,Imperatorin a furocoumarin inhibits periplasmic Cu-Zn SOD of Shigella dysenteriae their by modulates its resistance towards phagocytosis during host pathogen interaction.,"Shigella dysenteriae continues to be a major health problem, which leads to death, due to diarrhoea and dysentery, predominantly in children below the age of 5. Bacterial invasion of the colonic epithelium leads to severe inflammation together with bacterial dissemination generates abscesses and ulcerations. Periplasmic copper, zinc super oxide dismutase of Shigella protects it from exogenous superoxide produced by host, during its invasion. Hence, in present study an attempt was made to study the effect of aqueous extract of Aegle marmelos on host and pathogen defence. Histology analysis of rat ileal loop showed the loss of virulence in aqueous extract of A. marmelos pre-treated Shigella and their intracellular survival was also decreased, where active component present in aqueous extract of A. marmelos was identified as imperatorin confirmed by UV absorption spectrum and HPLC. Increase in peripheral blood mononuclear cell viability and decreased in intracellular bacterial count along with transmission electron microscope analysis of imperatorin treated S. dysenteriae succumb to host oxidative stress. Loss of virulence is associated with attenuation of copper, zinc super oxide dismutase activity in Shigella, which was confirmed by using activity staining of bacterial cell lysate. Further, by performing docking analysis it has been proved that imperatorin present in aqueous extract of A. marmelos inhibited copper, zinc super oxide dismutase. From the above study, we concluded that Shigella succumb to oxidative stress (host defence) due to inhibition of copper, zinc super oxide dismutase (pathogen's defence) by imperatorin, an active compound aqueous extract of A. marmelos.","['Raja SB', 'Murali MR', 'Roopa K', 'Devaraj SN']",2011,65,8,Biomed Pharmacother,"Raja SB, et al.

21143880,Antimicrobial resistance patterns and prevalence of class 1 and 2 integrons in Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei isolated in Uzbekistan.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella is a frequent cause of bacterial dysentery in the developing world. Treatment with effective antibiotics is recommended for shigellosis, but options become limited due to globally emerging resistance. One of the mechanisms for the development of resistance utilizes integrons. This study described the antibiotic susceptibility and the presence of class 1 and 2 integrons in S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolated in Uzbekistan.
RESULTS: We studied 31 isolates of S. flexneri and 21 isolates of S. sonnei isolated in Uzbekistan between 1992 and 2007 for the susceptibility or resistance to ampicillin (Am), chloramphenicol (Cl), tetracycline (Te), co-trimoxazole (Sxt), kanamycin (Km), streptomycin (Str), gentamicin (Gm), cefazolin (Czn), cefoperazone (Cpr), cefuroxime (Cur), ceftazidime (Ctz), nalidixic acid (NA) and ciprofloxacin (Cip). Am/Str/Cl/Te and Am/Str/Cl/Te/Sxt resistance patterns were found most frequently in S. flexneri. Single isolates were resistant to aminoglycoside, quinolones and cephalosporins. The resistance patterns were different in the two species. Integrons were detected in 93.5% of S. flexneri (29/31) and 81.0% of S. sonnei (17/21) isolates. In addition, 61.3% of S. flexneri (19/31) isolates and 19.0% of S. sonnei (4/21) isolates carried both classes of integrons. In 29.0% of S. flexneri (9/31) isolates, only class 1 integrons were identified. In S. flexneri isolates, the presence of class 1 integrons was associated with resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Only Class 2 integrons were present in 61.9% of S. sonnei (13/21) isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study documents antibiotic resistance among Shigella spp. in Uzbekistan. Ninety percent of Shigella strains were resistant to previously used antibiotics. Differences among S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolates in patterns of antimicrobial resistance to routinely used shigellosis antibiotics were observed. The majority of S. flexneri were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin. Class 1 and 2 integrons were widely present in these Shigella strains. Resistance to ampicillin/chloramphenicol was associated with the presence of class 1 integrons. Though several mechanisms are possible, the resistance of Shigella isolates to ampicillin/chloramphenicol may be associated with the expression of genes within class 1 integrons.","['Madiyarov RS', 'Bektemirov AM', 'Ibadova GA', 'Abdukhalilova GK', 'Khodiev AV', 'Bodhidatta L', 'Sethabutr O', 'Mason CJ']",2010,2,1,Gut Pathog,"Madiyarov RS, et al.

21143311,"The Shigella T3SS needle transmits a signal for MxiC release, which controls secretion of effectors.","Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) are key determinants of virulence in many Gram-negative bacteria, including animal and plant pathogens. They inject 'effector' proteins through a 'needle' protruding from the bacterial surface directly into eukaryotic cells after assembly of a 'translocator' pore in the host plasma membrane. Secretion is a tightly regulated process, which is blocked until physical contact with a host cell takes place. Host cell sensing occurs through a distal needle 'tip complex' and translocators are secreted before effectors. MxiC, a Shigella T3SS substrate, prevents premature effector secretion. Here, we examine how the different parts of T3SSs work together to allow orderly secretion. We show that T3SS assembly and needle tip composition are not altered in an mxiC mutant. We find that MxiC not only represses effector secretion but that it is also required for translocator release. We provide genetic evidence that MxiC acts downstream of the tip complex and then the needle during secretion activation. Finally, we show that the needle controls MxiC release. Therefore, for the first time, our data allow us to propose a model of secretion activation that goes from the tip complex to cytoplasmic MxiC via the needle.","['Martinez-Argudo I', 'Blocker AJ']",2010,78,6,Mol Microbiol,"Martinez-Argudo I and Blocker AJ.

21139855,Water microbiology. Bacterial pathogens and water.,"Water is essential to life, but many people do not have access to clean and safe drinking water and many die of waterborne bacterial infections. In this review a general characterization of the most important bacterial diseases transmitted through water-cholera, typhoid fever and bacillary dysentery-is presented, focusing on the biology and ecology of the causal agents and on the diseases' characteristics and their life cycles in the environment. The importance of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and emerging pathogens in drinking water-transmitted diseases is also briefly discussed. Microbiological water analysis is mainly based on the concept of fecal indicator bacteria. The main bacteria present in human and animal feces (focusing on their behavior in their hosts and in the environment) and the most important fecal indicator bacteria are presented and discussed (focusing on the advantages and limitations of their use as markers). Important sources of bacterial fecal pollution of environmental waters are also briefly indicated. In the last topic it is discussed which indicators of fecal pollution should be used in current drinking water microbiological analysis. It was concluded that safe drinking water for all is one of the major challenges of the 21st century and that microbiological control of drinking water should be the norm everywhere. Routine basic microbiological analysis of drinking water should be carried out by assaying the presence of Escherichia coli by culture methods. Whenever financial resources are available, fecal coliform determinations should be complemented with the quantification of enterococci. More studies are needed in order to check if ammonia is reliable for a preliminary screening for emergency fecal pollution outbreaks.

21139062,Enteric glia protect against Shigella flexneri invasion in intestinal epithelial cells: a role for S-nitrosoglutathione.,"BACKGROUND: Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are important regulators of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) functions. EGC-derived S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) has been shown to regulate IEB permeability. Whether EGCs and GSNO protect the IEB during infectious insult by pathogens such as Shigella flexneri is not known.
METHODS: S flexneri effects were characterised using in vitro coculture models of Caco-2 cells and EGCs (or GSNO), ex vivo human colonic mucosa, and in vivo ligated rabbit intestinal loops. The effect of EGCs on S flexneri-induced changes in the invasion area and the inflammatory response were analysed by combining immunohistochemical, ELISA and PCR methods. Expression of small G-proteins was analysed by western blot. Expression of ZO-1 and localisation of bacteria were analysed by fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: EGCs significantly reduced barrier lesions and inflammatory response induced by S flexneri in Caco-2 monolayers. The EGC-mediated effects were reproduced by GSNO, but not by reduced glutathione, and pharmacological inhibition of pathways involved in GSNO synthesis reduced EGC protecting effects. Furthermore, expression of Cdc42 and phospho-PAK in Caco-2 monolayers was significantly reduced in the presence of EGCs or GSNO. In addition, changes in ZO-1 expression and distribution induced by S flexneri were prevented by EGCs and GSNO. Finally, GSNO reduced S flexneri-induced lesions of the IEB in human mucosal colonic explants and in a rabbit model of shigellosis.
CONCLUSION: These results highlight a major protective function of EGCs and GSNO in the IEB against S flexneri attack. Consequently, this study lays the scientific basis for using GSNO to reduce barrier susceptibility to infectious or inflammatory challenge.","['Flamant M', 'Aubert P', 'Rolli-Derkinderen M', 'Bourreille A', 'Neunlist MR', 'Mahé MM', 'Meurette G', 'Marteyn B', 'Savidge T', 'Galmiche JP', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Neunlist M']",2011,60,4,Gut,"Flamant M, et al.

Nineteen confirmed and 37 presumptive cases, mostly young children, were identified. A case-control study implicated play in an interactive fountain in a city park (matched odds ratio undefined; p < .002). The association was confirmed by a cohort study among local schoolchildren (RR [relative risk] = 12.6, p < .001) that allowed the authors to estimate that > 500 persons became ill. Fountain design flaws and inadequate maintenance set the stage for the outbreak. In 2007, the authors surveyed state health departments to assess rules and regulations governing interactive fountains. Thirty of 48 states responding (62%) reported public health regulation of fountains; standards and enforcement capacity varied. Regulation is a relatively new phenomenon; only 13 states (27%) had rules before 2000. A lack of enforceable design and maintenance standards increases the risk of enteric disease transmission at these increasingly popular venues.","['Bancroft JE', 'Keifer SB', 'Keene WE']",2010,73,4,J Environ Health,"Bancroft JE, et al.

21126091,Conformational changes in IpaD from Shigella flexneri upon binding bile salts provide insight into the second step of type III secretion.,"Shigella flexneri uses its type III secretion apparatus (TTSA) to inject host-altering proteins into targeted eukaryotic cells. The TTSA is composed of a basal body and an exposed needle with invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) forming a tip complex that controls secretion. The bile salt deoxycholate (DOC) stimulates recruitment of the translocator protein IpaB into the maturing TTSA needle tip complex. This process appears to be triggered by a direct interaction between DOC and IpaD. Fluorescence spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy are used here to confirm the DOC-IpaD interaction and to reveal that IpaD conformational changes upon DOC binding trigger the appearance of IpaB at the needle tip. Förster resonance energy transfer between specific sites on IpaD was used here to identify changes in distances between IpaD domains as a result of DOC binding. To further explore the effects of DOC binding on IpaD structure, NMR chemical shift mapping was employed. The environments of residues within the proposed DOC binding site and additional residues within the ""distal"" globular domain were perturbed upon DOC binding, further indicating that conformational changes occur within IpaD upon DOC binding. These events are proposed to be responsible for the recruitment of IpaB at the TTSA needle tip. Mutation analyses combined with additional spectroscopic analyses confirm that conformational changes in IpaD induced by DOC binding contribute to the recruitment of IpaB to the S. flexneri TTSA needle tip. These findings lay the foundation for determining how environmental factors promote TTSA needle tip maturation prior to host cell contact.","['Dickenson NE', 'Zhang L', 'Epler CR', 'Adam PR', 'Picking WL', 'Picking WD']",2011,50,2,Biochemistry,"Dickenson NE, et al.

21110853,Social and cultural features of cholera and shigellosis in peri-urban and rural communities of Zanzibar.,"BACKGROUND: Responding to the high burden of cholera in developing countries, the WHO now considers vaccination as a supplement to the provision of safe drinking water and improved sanitation in the strategy for cholera control in endemic settings. Cultural concepts of illness affect many aspects of public health. In the first step of a two-step strategy to examine determinants of cholera vaccine acceptance, this study identified social and cultural features of diarrhoeal illness for cholera control in endemic communities.
METHODS: A cultural epidemiological study with locally adapted vignette-based interviews was conducted in two cholera-endemic communities of Zanzibar. A random sample of unaffected peri-urban (n = 179) and rural (n = 177) adults was interviewed to study community ideas of cholera and shigellosis, considering categories of distress, perceived causes, and help-seeking behaviour.
RESULTS: Cholera was recognised by 88%. Symptoms of dehydration were most prominent in reports at the peri-urban site. Interference with work leading to strain on household finances was frequently emphasised. Dirty environment was the most prominent perceived cause, followed by unsafe drinking water and germ-carrying flies. Causes unrelated to the biomedical basis of cholera were reported more often by rural respondents. Rural women had more difficulty (20%) to identify a cause than men (7.1%, p = 0.016). Peri-urban self treatment emphasised rehydration; the rural community preferred herbal treatment and antibiotics. Shigellosis was recognised by 70%. Fewer regarded it as very serious compared with cholera (76% vs. 97%, p < 0.001) and regarded it as less likely to be fatal (48% vs. 78%, p < 0.001). More respondents could not explain causes of shigellosis (23%) compared with cholera (7.3%, p < 0.001). Community respondents less frequently identified dehydration and contagiousness for shigellosis. Government facilities were preferred healthcare providers for both conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified local views of cholera and shigellosis relevant for diarrhoeal disease control in Zanzibar. The finding that rural women were less likely than men to specify causes of cholera suggests more attention to them is required. Better health education is needed for cholera in rural areas and for shigellosis in general. This study also identified variables for subsequent analysis of social and cultural determinants of cholera vaccine acceptance.","['Schaetti C', 'Khatib AM', 'Ali SM', 'Hutubessy R', 'Chaignat CL', 'Weiss MG']",2010,10,,BMC Infect Dis,"Schaetti C, et al.

Monte Carlo simulation and rate estimates for all stages, from visit to physician to reporting on a culture-confirmed case of shigellosis or salmonellosis, were used to determine the underestimation factor. Of 1492 children, 5·7% reported a diarrhoeal episode during the 2 weeks prior to interview. The rate of visiting a physician with and without fever was 86% and 16%, respectively. A stool culture was performed for around 20% of patients and the isolation rates were 7·1% for Shigella and 2·1% for Salmonella. Paediatricians (n=214) ranked very young age of patient and the complaint 'bloody diarrhoea' as the most important determinants. We estimated that one reported isolate of Shigella or Salmonella represented 152 diarrhoeal episodes of all aetiologies. This estimate is important for further assessments of the true burden of diarrhoeal diseases.","['Ziv T', 'Heymann AD', 'Azuri J', 'Leshno M', 'Cohen D']",2011,139,9,Epidemiol Infect,"Ziv T, et al.

21055309,[Detection and drug resistance analysis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Shigella in pediatric patients].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence and drug resistance of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing strains of Shigella in pediatric patients, so as to provide information for clinical treatment.
METHOD: A total of 59 strains of Shigella were isolated from stool specimens of hospitalized children with shigellosis from January 2004 to December 2008. The broth dilution test recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) was performed to detect the ESBLs producers. Susceptibility test was carried out by agar dilution method. Escherichia coli ATCC25922 and Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC700603 were used as quality control strains.
RESULT: Of the 59 isolates, 21 (35.6%) strains were identified as ESBLs producers. All of the 21 strains were detected by cefotaxime and cefotaxime/clavulanic acid, only 5 (23.8%) were detected by ceftazidime and ceftazidime/clavulanic acid. Both ESBLs and non-ESBLs producers showed high resistance to penicillins. The resistance of ESBLs-producing strains to third and fourth-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam was significantly higher than that of non-ESBLs-producing strains, as well as sulphonamides and quinolones. The drugs sensitive to ESBLs producers were imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefoxitin, with resistance rate of 0.0%, 0.0%, 14.3%, 9.5%, 14.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ESBLs-producing Shigella in pediatric patients is at a high level in this area, and the enzyme-producing strains are multidrug resistant. It is recommended that the detection of ESBLs in Shigella should be carried out by microbiological laboratories. Any of the above 5 antibiotics of low resistance should be used according to the patient's condition.","['Ji WJ', 'Xu XW', 'Dong F']",2010,48,8,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,"Ji WJ, et al.

21036493,The major surface Vsp proteins of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae form antigenic protein complexes.,"The Vsp proteins are the major outer membrane proteins of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, the causative agent of swine dysentery. Eight vsp genes have been identified in B. hyodysenteriae strain B204, arranged into two four-gene loci, and at least two of the corresponding proteins are produced in vitro. The aims of this study were to characterise the vsp genes of the virulent Australian B. hyodysenteriae strain X576 and their corresponding proteins, Genomic sequence comparison with strains B204 and WA1 demonstrated that the number of vsp genes varies between B. hyodysenteriae strains, although the chromosomal locations of the vsp gene loci are consistent. We identified two additional vsp-like genes, designated vspI and vspJ, in each of the three strains. Double SDS-PAGE was used to demonstrate that Vsp proteins of B. hyodysenteriae strain X576 form multimeric protein complexes in the outer membrane that are stable in 6M urea but dissociate after boiling. The Vsp complexes primarily consisted of VspF but also contain VspE and VspI. VspD was also found in a series of complexes slightly larger than the more abundant VspF complexes. Vsp proteins are purported to be antigenic; however little direct data are available to support this claim. In this study convalescent pig sera did not bind denatured Vsp proteins by Western blotting, but did bind the Vsp complexes on Western blots, showing that conformational epitopes may be important in immune recognition of these major outer membrane proteins. This is the first definitive demonstration of the antigenicity of these proteins in swine dysentery.","['Witchell TD', 'Hoke DE', 'Bulach DM', 'Coutts SA', 'Driesen SJ', 'Cordwell SJ', 'Adler B']",2011,149,1-2,Vet Microbiol,"Witchell TD, et al.

23051941,"Surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility pattern among shigella flexneri strain isolated in Nagpur district during three years period, January 2009-January 2012.","OBJECTIVE: In the few cases of childhood dirrhea that require the antimicrobial therapy, the correct choice of the drug depends on detailed previous knowledge of local strains and pattern of antimicrobial resistance. Shigellosis is one of the most improtant examples of this group of intestinal infections. In order to establish such parameters in Nagpur city, this study was carried out to determine the antimcrobial resistance profile of Shigella flexneri isolated from patients suffering from diahhrea admitted to Various hoapitals in Nagpur district, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 110 stool samples collected from patients during the 3 year period. All the isolates were characterized and confirmed by VITEK® 2 GN ID cards and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by VITEK® 2 AST test cards.
RESULTS: We received 73 positive cultures of S. flexneri out of 110 stool samples during three year periods of January 2009 to January 2012. S. flexneri strains presented a high resistance rate to Ampicillin (100%), Chloramphenicol (76.71%), Trimethoprime-sulfamethaxazole (TMP-SMZ) (68.49%) and low resistance to third- and fourth-generation Cephalosporin. None of the isolates was found to be resistant to Ciprofloxacin (MIC ≥ 4), Norfloxacin (MIC ≥12), and Nalidixic acid (MIC ≥30).
CONCLUSION: Our results provide data on antimicrobial resistance to choose a proper antibiotic for the treatment of Shigellosis in our country. According to current findings, Quinolones and Cephalosporins are the drug of choice for the diarrheic patients. In conclusion, systematic monitoring is needed to identify changes in the antimicrobial resistance.","['Dharmik PG', 'Gomashe AV', 'Wadher BJ']",2010,64,11,Indian J Med Sci,"Dharmik PG, et al.

21030833,Genetic characterization of atypical Shigella flexneri isolated in Korea.,"Three types of serotypically atypical Shigella flexneri strains were isolated from 2007 to 2008 in patients at the Korea National Institute of Health (NIH). These strains were characterized and compared with serologically typical S.flexneri. One type of strain either displayed nonreacting typing or grouping sera, reacting strongly only with polyB antisera, which indicates this strain is S. flexneri (polyB:un). The second type displayed reactions with one of the typing sera (IV) and did not bind any grouping sera (IV:un). The remaining type of strain displayed a plural agglutination pattern, reacted with one typing sera (II), and bound with two grouping sera (II:(3)4,7(8)). Among these atypical strains IV:un and II:(3)4,7(8) strains showed higher multi-antibiotic resistance in ampicillin, streptomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than typical strains. Furthermore, all II:(3)4,7(8) strains harbored integrons. This study suggests that these multiple antibiotic-resistant atypical S. flexneri are new subserotypes of S.flexneri that await further serological classification.","['Hong S', 'Choi YH', 'Choo YA', 'Choi Y', 'Choi SY', 'Kim DW', 'Lee BK', 'Park MS']",2010,20,10,J Microbiol Biotechnol,"Hong S, et al.

21030536,Effects of backbone substitutions on the conformational behavior of Shigella flexneri O-antigens: implications for vaccine strategy.,"The O-antigen (O-Ag), the polysaccharide part of the lipopolysaccharide, is the major target of the serotype-specific protective humoral response elicited upon host infection by Shigella flexneri, the main causal agent of the endemic form of bacillary dysentery. The O-Ag repeat units (RUs) of 12 S. flexneri serotypes share the tetrasaccharide backbone →2)-α-l-Rhap-(1 → 2)-α-l-Rhap-(1 → 3)-α-l-Rhap-(1 → 3)-β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→, with site-selective glucosylation(s) and/or O-acetylation defining the serotypes. To investigate the conformational basis of serotype specificity, we sampled conformational behaviors during 60 ns of molecular dynamic simulations for oligosaccharides representing three RUs of each one of the O-Ags corresponding to serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, X and Y, respectively. The calculated trajectories were checked by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for 1a, 2a, 3a and 5a O-Ags. The simulations predict that in all O-Ags, but 1a and 1b, serotype-specific substitutions of the backbone do not induce any new backbone conformations compared with the linear type O-Ag Y, although they restrain locally the accessible conformational space. Moreover, the influence of any given substituent on the backbone is independent of the eventual presence of other substituents. Finally, only slight differences in conformational behavior between terminal and inner RUs were observed. These results suggest that the reported serotype-specificity of the protective immune response is not due to recognition of distinct backbone conformations, but to binding of the serotype-defining substituents in the O-Ag context. The gained knowledge is discussed in terms of impact on the development of a broad-serotype coverage vaccine.","['Theillet FX', 'Simenel C', 'Guerreiro C', 'Phalipon A', 'Mulard LA', 'Delepierre M']",2011,21,1,Glycobiology,"Theillet FX, et al.

20951728,Surveillance of shigellosis by real-time PCR suggests underestimation of shigellosis prevalence by culture-based methods in a population of rural China.,"INTRODUCTION: Shigellosis is a leading public health issue in China, especially in Children under 5 years of age. The disease burden of shigellosis is usually underestimated by conventional culture. In this study, real-time PCR was applied to detect Shigella infection in parallel with routine culture, to investigate the true burden of disease caused by Shigella spp.
METHODS: Rectal swab specimens of 39 Shigella culture positive and 298 Shigella culture negative patients from a population-based surveillance study were selected randomly. Real-time PCR targeting the invasion plasmid antigen H gene sequence (ipaH) was used to detect DNA sequences characteristic for Shigella spp.
RESULTS: ipaH were detected in 174 of 298 (58%) randomly selected Shigella culture negative specimens and in 38 of 39 (97%) Shigella culture positive specimens (p < 0.001). Among 10 variables, culture results was the strongest predictive factor (OR = 15.5; 95% CI: 2.0-119.0), followed by a clinical presentation of diarrhea with fever (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.2-6.2), epidemic season (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.4-4.3), and female gender (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1-3.0).
CONCLUSION: The high detection rate of ipaH in culture negative specimens through use of real-time PCR suggests that earlier estimates of shigellosis burden measured by conventional culture may have underestimated the true disease burden.","['Wang SM', 'Ma JC', 'Hao ZY', 'Zhang ZY', 'Mason C', 'Sethabutr O', 'von Seidlein L', 'Wang XY', 'Xu ZY']",2010,61,6,J Infect,"Wang SM, et al.

MLVA is in our laboratory the routine typing method for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli (two assays), Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. The gram-negative invasive enteropathogenic bacterium Shigella is the most common cause of bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) worldwide, and is a global human health problem. It was of great interest to develop a rapid and robust MLVA-assay for this important pathogen. Though not common in Norway, we do receive isolates mostly associated with foreign travel and thus an outbreak may be possible. The resulting MLVA-assay is based on seven polymorphous VNTRs found by search in the published genomes of all Shigella species. The assay is fast (one multiplexed PCR reaction), robust and show high divergence among the Shigellae. A total of 235 Shigella spp. were typed with 194 distinct MLVA-genotypes.

Although EIEC and Shigella share many genetic and biochemical similarities, the illness caused by Shigella is more severe. Thus, genomic and structure-function molecular studies on the biological interactions of these invasive enterobacteria with eukaryotic cells have focused on Shigella rather than EIEC. Here we comparatively studied the interactions of EIEC and of Shigella flexneri with cultured J774 macrophage-like cells. We evaluated several phenotypes: (i) bacterial escape from macrophages after phagocytosis, (ii) macrophage death induced by EIEC and S. flexneri, (iii) macrophage cytokine expression in response to infection and (iv) expression of plasmidial (pINV) virulence genes. The results showed that S. flexneri caused macrophage killing earlier and more intensely than EIEC. Both pathogens induced significant macrophage production of TNF, IL-1 and IL-10 after 7 h of infection. Transcription levels of the gene invasion plasmid antigen-C were lower in EIEC than in S. flexneri throughout the course of the infection; this could explain the diminished virulence of EIEC compared to S. flexneri.","['Bando SY', 'Moreno AC', 'Albuquerque JA', 'Amhaz JM', 'Moreira-Filho CA', 'Martinez MB']",2010,105,6,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,"Bando SY, et al.

20937761,Domains of the Shigella flexneri type III secretion system IpaB protein involved in secretion regulation.,"Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) are key determinants of virulence in many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Upon cell contact, they inject effector proteins directly into eukaryotic cells through a needle protruding from the bacterial surface. Host cell sensing occurs through a distal needle ""tip complex,"" but how this occurs is not understood. The tip complex of quiescent needles is composed of IpaD, which is topped by IpaB. Physical contact with host cells initiates secretion and leads to assembly of a pore, formed by IpaB and IpaC, in the host cell membrane, through which other virulence effector proteins may be translocated. IpaB is required for regulation of secretion and may be the host cell sensor. It binds needles via its extreme C-terminal coiled coil, thereby likely positioning a large domain containing its hydrophobic regions at the distal tips of needles. In this study, we used short deletion mutants within this domain to search for regions of IpaB involved in secretion regulation.

20920053,Fecal-orally transmitted diseases among travelers are decreasing due to better hygienic standards at travel destination.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether changes in attack rates of fecal-orally transmitted diseases among travelers are related to changes in pretravel vaccination practices or better hygienic standards at travel destination.
METHODS: National surveillance data on all laboratory-confirmed cases of travel-related hepatitis A, shigellosis, and typhoid fever diagnosed in the Netherlands from 1995 to 2006 were matched with the number of Dutch travelers to developing countries to calculate region-specific annual attack rates. Trends in attack rates of non-vaccine-preventable shigellosis were compared with those of vaccine-preventable hepatitis A and typhoid fever. Trends were also compared with three markers for hygienic standards of the local population at travel destinations, drawn from the United Nations Development Programme database: the human development index, the sanitation index, and the water source index.
RESULTS: Attack rates among Dutch travelers to developing regions declined for hepatitis A, shigellosis, and typhoid fever. Region-specific trends in attack rates of shigellosis resembled trends of hepatitis A and typhoid fever. Declining attack rates of the three fecal-orally transmitted diseases correlated with improvements in socioeconomic, sanitary, and water supply conditions of the local population at travel destination.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that improved hygienic standards at travel destination strongly contributed to the overall decline in attack rates of fecal-orally transmitted diseases among visiting travelers.","['Baaten GG', 'Sonder GJ', 'Van Der Loeff MF', 'Coutinho RA', 'Van Den Hoek A']",2010,17,5,J Travel Med,"Baaten GG, et al.

20889896,Pediatric diarrhea in southern Ghana: etiology and association with intestinal inflammation and malnutrition.,"Diarrhea is a major public health problem that affects the development of children. Anthropometric data were collected from 274 children with (N = 170) and without (N = 104) diarrhea. Stool specimens were analyzed by conventional culture, polymerase chain reaction for enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba, and Giardia species, and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal lactoferrin levels. About 50% of the study population was mildly to severely malnourished. Fecal lactoferrin levels were higher in children with diarrhea (P = 0.019). Children who had EAEC infection, with or without diarrhea, had high mean lactoferrin levels regardless of nutritional status. The EAEC and Cryptosporidium were associated with diarrhea (P = 0.048 and 0.011, respectively), and malnourished children who had diarrhea were often co-infected with both Cryptosporidium and EAEC. In conclusion, the use of DNA-biomarkers revealed that EAEC and Cryptosporidium were common intestinal pathogens in Accra, and that elevated lactoferrin was associated with diarrhea in this group of children.","['Opintan JA', 'Newman MJ', 'Ayeh-Kumi PF', 'Affrim R', 'Gepi-Attee R', 'Sevilleja JE', 'Roche JK', 'Nataro JP', 'Warren CA', 'Guerrant RL']",2010,83,4,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Opintan JA, et al.

20888321,Defensins play a crucial role in protecting mice against oral Shigella flexneri infection.,"An earlier study revealed that 4-day-old mice, but not older mice, were infected with invasive Shigella strains. Here we attempted to determine the underlying mechanism that induces inflammation in the intestines of neonate mice after oral Shigella infection. Wild-type BALB/c mice of different ages (7, 14, and 35 days old) were orally administered GFP-expressing Shigella flexneri 5a M90T strain (5 x 10⁹ CFU) and analyzed for colonization 6h following infection. We found that Shigella localized in the epithelium, lamina propria, and crypt regions of the small intestines of 7-day-old BALB/c mice. Microarray analysis revealed that expression levels of cryptdin and various types of cryptdin-related mRNA (e.g., cryptrs-2, -5, -7, -12 and lysozyme) in the small intestines were significantly lower in 7-day-old than in older mice regardless of Shigella infection status. Interestingly, matrix metalloprotease-7 (matrilysin)-deficient (MAT⁻/⁻) mice of B6 background had more colonies and more severe symptoms of inflammation in the intestines than did wild-type B6 mice after oral Shigella challenge. This suggests that cryptdin-related antimicrobial molecules are indispensable for efficient protection against oral Shigella infection.","['Shim DH', 'Ryu S', 'Kweon MN']",2010,401,4,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Shim DH, et al.

24031576,Antimicrobial resistance and PCR-ribotyping of Shigella responsible for foodborne outbreaks occurred in southern Brazil.,"Little information about Shigella responsible for foodborne shigellosis is available in Brazil. The present study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial resistance and PCR-ribotyping patterns of Shigella isolates responsible for foodborne outbreaks occurred in Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), Southern Brazil in the period between 2003 and 2007. Shigella strains (n=152) were isolated from foods and fecal samples of victims of shigellosis outbreaks investigated by the Surveillance Service. Identification of the strains at specie level indicated that 71.1% of them were S. flexneri, 21.5% S. sonnei, and 0.7% S. dysenteriae. Ten strains (6.7%) were identified only as Shigella spp. An increasing occurrence of S. sonnei was observed after 2004. Most of the strains were resistant to streptomycin (88.6%), followed by ampicillin (84.6%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (80.5 %). Resistant strains belonged to 73 patterns, and pattern A (resistance to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and intermediate resistance to kanamycin) grouped the largest number of isolates (n=36). PCR-ribotyping identified three banding patterns (SH1, SH2, and SH3). SH1 grouped all S. flexneri and SH2 grouped all S. sonnei. The S. dysenteriae strain belonged to group SH3. According to the results, several Shigella isolates shared the same PCR-rybotyping banding pattern and the same resistance profile, suggesting that closely related strains were responsible for the outbreaks. However, other molecular typing methods need to be applied to confirm the clonal relationship of these isolates.","['de Paula CM', 'Mercedes PG', 'do Amaral PH', 'Tondo EC']",2010,41,4,Braz J Microbiol,"de Paula CM, et al.

20845448,Formulation and immunogenicity studies of type III secretion system needle antigens as vaccine candidates.,"Bacterial infections caused by Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, and Burkholderia pseudomallei are currently difficult to prevent due to the lack of a licensed vaccine. Here we present formulation and immunogenicity studies for the three type III secretion system (TTSS) needle proteins MxiH(Δ5), PrgI(Δ5), and BsaL(Δ5) (each truncated by five residues at its C terminus) as potential candidates for vaccine development. These antigens are found to be thermally stabilized by the presence of carbohydrates and polyols. Additionally, all adsorb readily to aluminum hydroxide apparently through a combination of hydrogen bonds and/or Van der Waals forces. The interaction of these proteins with the aluminum-based adjuvant changes with time resulting in varying degrees of irreversible binding. Peptide maps of desorbed protein, however, suggest that chemical changes are not responsible for this irreversible association. The ability of MxiH(Δ5) and PrgI(Δ5) to elicit strong humoral immune responses was tested in a murine model. When administered intramuscularly as monomers, the needle components exhibited dose dependent immunogenic behavior. The polymerized version of MxiH was exceptionally immunogenic even at low doses. The responses of both monomeric and polymerized forms were boosted by adsorption to an aluminum salt adjuvant.","['Barrett BS', 'Markham AP', 'Esfandiary R', 'Picking WL', 'Picking WD', 'Joshi SB', 'Middaugh CR']",2010,99,11,J Pharm Sci,"Barrett BS, et al.

20804308,An outbreak of shigellosis due to Shigella flexneri serotype 3a in a prison in Iran.,"BACKGROUND: On June 16 and 17, 2007, the medical clinic of a prison in Isfahan, Iran received multiple reports of gastrointestinal illness among prisoners. A cross-sectional study was therefore undertaken to determine the extent, causative agent and possible source of the outbreak.
METHODS: A case-patient was defined and patient information was collected with a standardized questionnaire. Stool samples were collected from the patients and restaurant employees, and analyzed for the presence of enteric bacteria by routine bacteriological methods. Shigella isolates were identified and serotyped by commercially available antisera. The relationship between the strains was determined using antimicrobial drug resistance pattern analysis and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR).
RESULTS: Seven hundred one inmates experienced gastrointestinal illness and severe diarrhea. The attack rate was 14.02%. Rectal swabs and stool cultures recovered from patients tested positive for Shigella flexneri serotype 3a. All tested isolates had a similar antibiotic resistance and ERIC-PCR pattern. Our findings demonstrated that raw vegetables were more likely to be the causative agent of this outbreak.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that a single clone of S. flexneri was responsible for this outbreak. Although we could not trace the exact origin of the organism, the consumption of raw vegetables one day prior to the onset of illness was strongly associated with an increased risk of S. flexneri infection. This study emphasizes the need for accurate monitoring and surveillance of food and vegetables consumed in prisons.","['Ranjbar R', 'Hosseini MJ', 'Kaffashian AR', 'Farshad S']",2010,13,5,Arch Iran Med,"Ranjbar R, et al.

This study examined the relationship between the spatial pattern of water-borne diseases vis-a-vis water quality in parts of Ibadan City in Nigeria. Data on 1334 cases of various water-borne diseases was collected from eight public hospitals with catchments covering the study area. Three areas with relatively high incidence of water-borne diseases and another three areas with relatively low incidence were selected for water sampling and household survey. Water samples from rains, wells, and borehole were collected for physical and bacteriological analyses. A well structured questionnaire was administered to 350 residents of the selected areas to elicit information on water sourcing, handling and storage. Analysis of hospital records showed significant difference in the occurrence of water-borne diseases among residential areas (P < 0.05). Typhoid fever had the highest occurrence (39.3%) followed by bacillary dysentery and cholera. About 45% of water-borne diseases were reported in July to September. The majority (77.1%) of the respondents depended on wells as major source of domestic water. Faecal coliform contamination of water samples ranged between 0.1 x 10(4) and 1.8 x 10(4) CFU ml(-1).

20733033,PAD4 is essential for antibacterial innate immunity mediated by neutrophil extracellular traps.,"Neutrophils trap and kill bacteria by forming highly decondensed chromatin structures, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We previously reported that histone hypercitrullination catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) correlates with chromatin decondensation during NET formation. However, the role of PAD4 in NET-mediated bacterial trapping and killing has not been tested. Here, we use PAD4 knockout mice to show that PAD4 is essential for NET-mediated antibacterial function. Unlike PAD4(+/+) neutrophils, PAD4(-/-) neutrophils cannot form NETs after stimulation with chemokines or incubation with bacteria, and are deficient in bacterial killing by NETs. In a mouse infectious disease model of necrotizing fasciitis, PAD4(-/-) mice are more susceptible to bacterial infection than PAD4(+/+) mice due to a lack of NET formation. Moreover, we found that citrullination decreased the bacterial killing activity of histones and nucleosomes, which suggests that PAD4 mainly plays a role in chromatin decondensation to form NETs instead of increasing histone-mediated bacterial killing. Our results define a role for histone hypercitrullination in innate immunity during bacterial infection.","['Li P', 'Li M', 'Lindberg MR', 'Kennett MJ', 'Xiong N', 'Wang Y']",2010,207,9,J Exp Med,"Li P, et al.

The etiologic agent in developed countries is viral in 15-60% of cases, while in developing countries, bacteria and parasites are frequently reported as the etiologic factors. Neurologic signs including convulsion are seen in some cases of diarrhea. This study aimed to investigate the etiology, risk factors and short-term prognosis of gastroenteritis with convulsion. During a case-control study, 100 patients with gastroenteritis were enrolled into the case and control groups on the basis of convulsion or no convulsion development, respectively. This study was conducted in Tabriz Children's Hospital from March 2004 to March 2007. The age of patients ranged from 2 months to 7 years, and the groups were age- and sex-matched. Body temperature (BT), severity and type of dehydration, stool exam and culture, past history of convulsion in the patient and first-degree relatives, electrolyte imbalance, and short-term prognosis were studied and compared. The mean weight of groups was not different, while the frequency of fever at the time of admission, past history of febrile convulsion in first-degree relatives and severity of dehydration were significantly higher in the case group (p < 0.001). The BT of the case group on admission was higher than in the control group (39.01+/- 0.80 vs. 37.52 +/- 0.67 degrees C; p < 0.001). Past history of febrile convulsion in the patient, shigellosis and antibiotic usage were also significantly higher in the case group (p = 0.025, p = 0.014 and p = 0.001). Convulsion mostly occurred in mild gastroenteritis accompanied with fever and positive history of febrile convulsion in first-degree relatives.

A total of 100 and 42 strains were collected from UAE and Kuwait, respectively. The extent of drug resistance in the Shigella spp. isolates from these two countries was analyzed by criteria recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Amikacin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and tigecycline had excellent activities against all isolates from UAE and Kuwait with MIC(90s) of 12, 0.094, 4, 0.012, 0.25, 0.032, 3 and 0.25 microg/ml and 4, 1, 4, 0.125, 0.38, 0.19, 3 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. Half of all isolates from both countries were resistant to ampicillin. None of the isolates in Kuwait was resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid compared with 22% in UAE. Resistance to chloramphenicol was recorded in 50 and 36% of the isolates in Kuwait and UAE, respectively. The percentages of non-susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline were very high in Kuwait and UAE (76% vs. 92% and 76% vs. 98%, respectively). Notably, one isolate, S. flexneri, from UAE had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.25 microg/ml). Four (2.8%) of the isolates were ESBL producers by the E test ESBL method but could not be confirmed by PCR using primers for bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV) and bla(TEM). In conclusion, Shigella spp. isolated from symptomatic patients in Kuwait and the UAE demonstrated high rates of resistance to the first-line antibiotics but very susceptible to the carbapenems, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and tigecycline.

The purpose of this review is to present key findings in the areas of epidemiology, disease control, and treatment of shigellosis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research activity has advanced the understanding of the epidemiology and host-pathogen interactions. Increased investment and activity in the area of vaccine development have lead to a diversification of candidates and ongoing technical advances yet continue to yield disappointing results in clinical trials in endemic populations and among the most relevant age groups (children under 2 years of age). The description of the rapid spread of quinolone resistance requires monitoring to ensure appropriate case management, particularly in south-east Asia. The evaluation of adjunctive nutritional therapy in endemic areas has supported the use of green bananas in shortening the duration of Shigella dysentery and persistent diarrhea due to Shigella, as well as improving weight gain in early convalescence.
SUMMARY: Despite a great level of activity in basic sciences, there continues to be a large gap in the ability to translate these findings into disease control measures or therapeutic options for individuals living in areas in which shigellosis is endemic.","['Kosek M', 'Yori PP', 'Olortegui MP']",2010,23,5,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Kosek M, et al.

20685089,Plasmid-mediated streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole resistance in Shigella flexneri 3a.,"Shigellosis is a major cause of diarrhoea-related morbidity and mortality, especially in children in developing countries such as India. Recently, it was estimated that 91 million individuals worldwide contract shigellosis each year. The emergence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant strains of Shigella is now an emerging global health problem. During the past two decades, much attention was given to re-evaluation of treatment recommendations. In the present study, we investigated a clinical strain of Shigella flexneri 3a with multiple drug resistance. This strain was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and trimethoprim. However, it was susceptible to 46.7% of drugs tested, i.e. azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin. A 6.3-kb plasmid was cured from this strain using acridine orange. Following curing, it was observed that 87% of drug resistance loci of S. flexneri 3a are chromosomal and 13% are plasmid-encoded. This 6.3-kb plasmid was involved in streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole resistance in S. flexneri 3a strain, which was confirmed by the disk diffusion method. Clonality was confirmed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). This study contributes to our knowledge on acquired drug resistance in one of the most common Shigella spp., S. flexneri 3a, which will enable better understanding of effective clinical management of shigellosis.","['Barman S', 'Chatterjee S', 'Chowdhury G', 'Ramamurthy T', 'Niyogi SK', 'Kumar R', 'Koley H']",2010,36,4,Int J Antimicrob Agents,"Barman S, et al.

20661101,Convalescent cultures for control of shigellosis outbreaks.,"BACKGROUND: A shigellosis outbreak in the St Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of a second convalescent stool culture following an initial negative convalescent stool culture among persons excluded from work or childcare for shigellosis.
METHODS: An observational study of 219 shigellosis cases. Laboratory-confirmed shigellosis patients who are required to submit 2 negative convalescent stool cultures before returning to childcare facilities or work and who submitted at least 1 culture were included in the study. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate potential risk factors for a convalescent stool culture being positive.
RESULTS: Of 308 persons, 219 (71%) submitted at least 1 convalescent stool culture, and 164 (53%) submitted 2 negative convalescent stool cultures. Among 172 cases with > or =2 follow-up cultures, the probability that the second test result would agree with the first test result was 7% for a ""positive"" initial stool culture, and 100% for a ""negative"" stool culture. When adjusted for age, sex, and child care attendance, treated case-patients who had Shigella organisms in the first convalescent culture were more likely to have had stool collected <48 hours after the treatment completion and were more likely to have been treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
CONCLUSIONS: Compliance is poor with statutes requiring serial negative stool cultures among certain populations with shigellosis. Absence of Shigella species in the first convalescent stool culture of patients recovering from shigellosis appears to be an adequate measure of bacteriologic cure; however, the health impacts of requiring any convalescent cultures during shigellosis outbreaks remain unclear.","['Turabelidze G', 'Bowen A', 'Lin M', 'Tucker A', 'Butler C', 'Fick F']",2010,29,8,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Turabelidze G, et al.

In this study, Shikimate Kinase (SK) from S. flexneri was characterized in silico and disordered regions were predicted. Motifs and domains were calculated using computational tools. A three dimensional model of Shikimate Kinase of S.flexneri was constructed using Shikimate Kinase of E.coli (PDBID: 1KAG_A) as template by comparative modeling approach. Molecular dynamics calculations were carried out to check the stable conformation embedded in water sphere with least RMSD possible. Perusal of backbone conformation of the modeled structure by PROCHECK revealed that more than 98% of the residues fell in the allowed regions and ERRAT results confirmed good quality of modeled structure. Active site and its important residues were predicted for the derived model. Disulphide bridges were estimated by computational method and most probable pattern of cysteine residues was found in the pairs 8-22. Results of this study will shed light on the structural aspects of Shikimate Kinase of S. flexneri and will aid in rational drug designing.","['Arora N', 'Banerjee AK', 'Murty US']",2010,2,3,Interdiscip Sci,"Arora N, et al.

This paper is aimed at developing and evaluating an innovative hybrid model, which combines the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models, for bacillary dysentery forecasting. Data of monthly bacillary dysentery incidence in Yichang City from 2000-2007 was obtained from Yichang Disease Control and Prevention Center. The SARIMA and SARIMA-GRNN model were developed and validated by dividing the data file into two data sets: data from the past 5 years was used to construct the models, and data from January to June of the 6th year was used to validate them. Simulation and forecasting performance was evaluated and compared between the two models. The hybrid SARIMA-GRNN model was found to outperform the SARIMA model with the lower mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error in simulation and prediction results. Developing and applying the SARIMA-GRNN hybrid model is an effective decision supportive method for producing reliable forecasts of bacillary dysentery for the study area.","['Yan W', 'Xu Y', 'Yang X', 'Zhou Y']",2010,63,4,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Yan W, et al.

20559407,[Analysis of disease types of outpatients with intestinal diseases from two grade-three general hospitals in Beijing].,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the spectrum of diseases and epidemiological characteristics of outpatients at Entric Disease Clinic, with a focus on analysis of the distribution of infectious diarrheal diseases in different populations and to explore disease control strategies on Enteric Infectious Diseases for focal groups.
METHODS: A census on outpatients at Entric Disease Clinics was conducted in two class Three comprehensive hospitals in Beijing from April 1 to October 31, 2009 based on a descriptive study using diarrhea-syndrome surveillance system set in the two clinics, thus to depict the spectrum of diseases and epidemiological characteristics of outpatients, and analyze the proportion of infectious diarrhea in diarrheal diseases specifically and the rate changes of infectious diarrhea in different months, age groups and occupational groups.
RESULTS: Diseases are varied at the two enteric diseases clinics among the patients and there are mainly 10 kinds of diseases, ""non-infectious diarrhea"" accounted for the highest percentage (77.4%), followed by ""unspecified diarrhea"" (11.7%), and infectious diarrhea accounted for the least proportion(8.7%).""Gastroenteritis and enteritis"" are the most frequently diagnosed cases among all the diseases, was a total of 7 565 cases, accounting for 70.2%. The volume of visits reached its top during summer and autumn(July to September), and the mean volume of visits in this period is (60.78+/-16.85) cases/day. The volume of visits has an obvious seasonal trend, and visits during July and August are the most frequent (41.82% altogether). Patients with ""infectious diarrhea"" had a highest ratio(5.3%) in May and lowest (1.1%) in October while patients with ""bacillary dysentery"" accounted for a highest ratio(8.2%) in September and lowest(3.8%) in April. Outpatients are mainly from Beijing city(61.9%), in which young and middle-aged people accounted for 73.9% in total, and student is the main occupation (28.8%). The distributions of diarrheal diseases are the same in different age groups but differ from different occupational groups. Infectious diarrhea accounted for a highest proportion(9.2%) in 18-to-44-year-old age group when using age grouping, and a highest proportion(15.2%) in restaurant service personnel when using occupation grouping.
CONCLUSION: The volume of outpatients attended at general hospitals is overwhelming especially in July and August, and the major type is ""non-infectious diseases"", which indicates an arduous task on prevention and control of Enteric Infectious Diseases. Infectious diarrhea took up a certain amount, but the rate is not that high, which indicates possible missing diagnosis of patients with infectious diseases.Our focal groups would be young and middle-aged people and students in the city. Therefore, the need to extend the consultation hours is urgent. Meanwhile, for the main goal of surveillance and early warning on Enteric Infectious Diseases, all aspects of construction of Enteric Disease Clinic should be strengthened, such as enhance laboratory tests on pathogens, improve diagnosis level of physicians and etc.","['Kadeerbai HS', 'Liu M', 'Dai XQ', 'Li XG', 'Li YL', 'Yang XS', 'Lu BH', 'Wang ZH', 'Zhu FX', 'Wu H', 'Zhao X', 'Xu J', 'Ning YZ']",2010,42,3,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,"Kadeerbai HS, et al.

20544028,The sudden dominance of blaCTX-M harbouring plasmids in Shigella spp. Circulating in Southern Vietnam.,"BACKGROUND: Plasmid mediated antimicrobial resistance in the Enterobacteriaceae is a global problem. The rise of CTX-M class extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) has been well documented in industrialized countries. Vietnam is representative of a typical transitional middle income country where the spectrum of infectious diseases combined with the spread of drug resistance is shifting and bringing new healthcare challenges.
METHODOLOGY: We collected hospital admission data from the pediatric population attending the hospital for tropical diseases in Ho Chi Minh City with Shigella infections. Organisms were cultured from all enrolled patients and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Those that were ESBL positive were subjected to further investigation. These investigations included PCR amplification for common ESBL genes, plasmid investigation, conjugation, microarray hybridization and DNA sequencing of a bla(CTX-M) encoding plasmid.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that two different bla(CTX-M) genes are circulating in this bacterial population in this location. Sequence of one of the ESBL plasmids shows that rather than the gene being integrated into a preexisting MDR plasmid, the bla(CTX-M) gene is located on relatively simple conjugative plasmid. The sequenced plasmid (pEG356) carried the bla(CTX-M-24) gene on an ISEcp1 element and demonstrated considerable sequence homology with other IncFI plasmids.
SIGNIFICANCE: The rapid dissemination, spread of antimicrobial resistance and changing population of Shigella spp. concurrent with economic growth are pertinent to many other countries undergoing similar development. Third generation cephalosporins are commonly used empiric antibiotics in Ho Chi Minh City. We recommend that these agents should not be considered for therapy of dysentery in this setting.","['Nguyen NT', 'Ha V', 'Tran NV', 'Stabler R', 'Pham DT', 'Le TM', 'van Doorn HR', 'Cerdeño-Tárraga A', 'Thomson N', 'Campbell J', 'Nguyen VM', 'Tran TT', 'Pham MV', 'Cao TT', 'Wren B', 'Farrar J', 'Baker S']",2010,4,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Nguyen NT, et al.

This finding is now extended to the O-SPC of Shigella flexneri 2a and 6, and Shigella dysenteriae type 1. The structures of O-SPC, containing core plus 1-4 O-SP repeat units (RUs), were analyzed by NMR and mass spectroscopy. The first RUs attached to the cores of S. flexneri 2a and 6 LPS were different from the following RUs in their O-acetylation and/or glucosylation. Conjugates of core plus more than 1 RU were necessary to induce LPS antibodies in mice. The resulting antibody levels were comparable to those induced by the full length O-SP conjugates. In S. dysenteriae type 1, the first RU was identical to the following RUs, with the exception that the GlcNAc was bound to the core in the beta-configuration, while in all other RUs the GlcNAc was present in the alpha-configuration. In spite of this difference, conjugates of S. dysenteriae type 1 core with 1, 2, or 3 RUs induced LPS antibodies in mice with levels statistically higher than those of the full size O-SP conjugates.

20525927,Diets containing inulin but not lupins help to prevent swine dysentery in experimentally challenged pigs.,"Swine dysentery is a contagious mucohemorrhagic diarrheal disease caused by the intestinal spirochete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae that colonizes and induces inflammation of the cecum and colon. It has been reported that a diet containing chicory root and sweet lupin can prevent swine dysentery. This experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that inulin in the chicory root rather than galactans in lupins was responsible for protective effects. An experiment with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was undertaken using pigs fed barley- and triticale-based diets, with the main effects being protein source [185 g/kg of canola meal (decreased galactans) or 220 g/kg of lupins (greater galactans)] and inulin supplementation (0 or 80 g/kg). Forty Large White × Landrace pigs weighing 21 ± 3 kg, with 10 pigs per diet, were allowed to adapt to the diets for 2 wk, and then each pig was challenged orally 4 times with a broth culture containing B. hyodysenteriae on consecutive days. Pigs were killed when they showed clinical signs of dysentery or 6 wk postchallenge. Pigs fed diets without inulin had 8.3 times greater risk (P = 0.017) of developing swine dysentery and were 16 times more likely (P = 0.004) to have colon contents that were culture-positive for B. hyodysenteriae, compared with the pigs fed a diet with 80 g/kg of inulin. Diets containing lupins did not prevent pigs from developing clinical swine dysentery; however, inclusion of lupins or inulin or both in the diets delayed the onset of disease compared with the diet based mainly on canola meal (P < 0.05). Diet did not influence the total concentration of organic acids in the ileum, cecum, or upper and lower colon; however, the molar proportions of the organic acids were influenced (P < 0.05). Consequently the pH values in the cecum, and upper and lower colon were not influenced (P > 0.05) by diet. However the pH values of the ileal digesta were decreased in pigs fed the diet with both lupins and inulin compared with the diet containing only lupins (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study shows that diets supplemented with highly fermentable carbohydrates from inulin protected pigs against developing swine dysentery.","['Hansen CF', 'Phillips ND', 'La T', 'Hernandez A', 'Mansfield J', 'Kim JC', 'Mullan BP', 'Hampson DJ', 'Pluske JR']",2010,88,10,J Anim Sci,"Hansen CF, et al.

20494122,Battle and balance at mucosal surfaces--the story of Shigella and antimicrobial peptides.,"Shigella is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for children in many developing countries. Emergence of antibiotic-resistance among Shigella demands the development of effective medicines. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are expressed in phagocytes and at epithelial surfaces and are important effector molecules of innate immunity. We have found that pathogens are able to turn off the endogenous expression of AMPs, resulting in serious infections such as shigellosis. A therapeutic rationale to prevent microbial invasion would be to strengthen the epithelial line of defence through enhancing AMP expression. We have identified several inducers of AMP-production, including butyrate, phenylbutyrate and vitamin D, which have been investigated in animal models of shigellosis as well as in clinical trials. We believe that the conceptual framework presented here can be applied to additional clinical entities and that this novel approach can be an alternative or complement to traditional antibiotics in the future.","['Gudmundsson GH', 'Bergman P', 'Andersson J', 'Raqib R', 'Agerberth B']",2010,396,1,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Gudmundsson GH, et al.

20485572,The type III effectors NleE and NleB from enteropathogenic E. coli and OspZ from Shigella block nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65.,"Many bacterial pathogens utilize a type III secretion system to deliver multiple effector proteins into host cells. Here we found that the type III effectors, NleE from enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and OspZ from Shigella, blocked translocation of the p65 subunit of the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, to the host cell nucleus. NF-kappaB inhibition by NleE was associated with decreased IL-8 expression in EPEC-infected intestinal epithelial cells. Ectopically expressed NleE also blocked nuclear translocation of p65 and c-Rel, but not p50 or STAT1/2. NleE homologues from other attaching and effacing pathogens as well OspZ from Shigella flexneri 6 and Shigella boydii, also inhibited NF-kappaB activation and p65 nuclear import; however, a truncated form of OspZ from S. flexneri 2a that carries a 36 amino acid deletion at the C-terminus had no inhibitory activity. We determined that the C-termini of NleE and full length OspZ were functionally interchangeable and identified a six amino acid motif, IDSY(M/I)K, that was important for both NleE- and OspZ-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. We also established that NleB, encoded directly upstream from NleE, suppressed NF-kappaB activation. Whereas NleE inhibited both TNFalpha and IL-1beta stimulated p65 nuclear translocation and IkappaB degradation, NleB inhibited the TNFalpha pathway only. Neither NleE nor NleB inhibited AP-1 activation, suggesting that the modulatory activity of the effectors was specific for NF-kappaB signaling. Overall our data show that EPEC and Shigella have evolved similar T3SS-dependent means to manipulate host inflammatory pathways by interfering with the activation of selected host transcriptional regulators.","['Newton HJ', 'Pearson JS', 'Badea L', 'Kelly M', 'Lucas M', 'Holloway G', 'Wagstaff KM', 'Dunstone MA', 'Sloan J', 'Whisstock JC', 'Kaper JB', 'Robins-Browne RM', 'Jans DA', 'Frankel G', 'Phillips AD', 'Coulson BS', 'Hartland EL']",2010,6,5,PLoS Pathog,"Newton HJ, et al.

20440057,High prevalence of trimethoprim-resistance cassettes in class 1 and 2 integrons in Senegalese Shigella spp isolates.,"BACKGROUND: Integrons have a well-established role in the dissemination of resistance among Gram-negative pathogens and are thus a useful marker of antibiotic resistance. Shigellae are noteworthy for their multiple drug resistance, having gradually acquired resistance to most widely use and inexpensive antimicrobial drugs.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 32 Shigella strains belonging to serotypes flexneri, dysenteriae, and boydii 20, a new Shigella serovar, resistant to at least four antibiotics were analyzed by molecular techniques.
RESULTS: Class 1 integrons were the most prevalent (92.8%); class 2 integrons were found in 16 strains (57.1%). Fifty percent of the strains harboured both class 1 and 2 integrons (intI1 and intI2 genes); this combination of integrase genes was most prevalent in S. boydii 20 and S. dysenteriae strains. The class 1 integrons detected contained dfr and aadA cassettes, alone or in combination (dfrA5/dfrA15, or dfrA15-aadA1, dfrA1-aadA2), and an atypical cassette array with an insertion sequence (oxa30-aadA1-IS1). For class 2 integrons, we detected either the same cassettes as those found in Tn7 (dfrA1-sat1-aadA1-orfX) or truncated class 2 integrons without aadA1 or orfX. The tns genes were absent from all class 2 integrons.The distribution of integrons among RAPD profiles and serotypes revealed a clonal spread of integrons into serotypes and a transfer of integrons between different serotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: The detection of integrons in a new Shigella serovar, in addition with a high integron prevalence among Shigella strains, confirms the propensity of shigellae to acquire and disseminate resistance determinants.","['Gassama Sow A', 'Aïdara-Kane A', 'Barraud O', 'Gatet M', 'Denis F', 'Ploy MC']",2010,4,4,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Gassama Sow A, et al.

20438349,"Antimicrobial resistance trends of Shigella serotypes in New York City, 2006-2009.","Shigellosis is the third most common enteric bacterial infection in the United States. Although infection is typically self-limiting, empiric treatment is often prescribed. Because of increasing antimicrobial resistance to Shigella, empiric treatment options are decreasing. Identifying resistance patterns can inform empiric treatment recommendations. The goals of our study were to examine risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance of Shigella and examine issues related to empiric treatment and antimicrobial resistance of Shigella. During June 2006-February 2009, we attempted to interview all New York City patients reported to have shigellosis. Their Shigella isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to examine the level of resistance and identify risk factors for resistance. Analysis was conducted on two groups distinguished by a large outbreak that was documented during the data collection period. Of the 477 nonoutbreak patients, 333 (70%) patients reported taking an antibiotic for shigellosis and 36 (11%) were treated with an antibiotic to which their Shigella infection was resistant. Among this group, high levels of antimicrobial resistance were detected to amoxicillin-clavulanate (66%), ampicillin (68%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (66%). Non-travel-associated ciprofloxacin-resistant Shigella (five patients) and ciprofloxacin-resistant Shigella sonnei (four patients) were reported for the first time to our knowledge. Antimicrobial resistance is significantly higher in New York City residents compared with national data. Some patients were treated with therapies that were not effective and to which the patient's Shigella infection was resistant. Shigella infections should not be treated with antibiotics unless the patient presents with severe or underlying illness and is at risk for systemic illness. When treatment is indicated, local monitoring of Shigella for antimicrobial resistance will provide local clinicians with the best guidance for effective empiric treatments.","['Wong MR', 'Reddy V', 'Hanson H', 'Johnson KM', 'Tsoi B', 'Cokes C', 'Gallagher L', 'Lee L', 'Plentsova A', 'Dang T', 'Krueger A', 'Joyce K', 'Balter S']",2010,16,2,Microb Drug Resist,"Wong MR, et al.

A high level of antimicrobial resistance to streptomycin (100%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (95%), tetracycline (94%), nalidixic acid (65%), and ampicillin (41%) was observed among S. sonnei isolates. Fourteen profiles of antimicrobial resistance were identified with the most common resistance profile being nalidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (35%). PCR and DNA sequencing analysis revealed the presence of class 2 integron in all isolates, and class 1 and 2 integrons in 7 isolates. The class 2 integron carried two types of gene cassettes. One cassette array was dfrI, sat2, and aadA1 (91%), and the other was dfr1 and sat1 (8%). dfrA12 and aadA2 gene cassette was found in one isolate containing class 1 integron. PFGE was carried out to examine the genetic relatedness among isolates. All isolates except for one showed similar PFGE patterns (similarity of 80.1%).

20422843,[Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute gastroenteritis in Israel].,"BACKGROUND: Nearly all children will experience at least one episode of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) by the age of three years. Acute gastroenteritis is a common cause of admissions to the pediatric wards in Israel, but usually the disease is mild.
AIM: This paper aims to present guidelines for diagnosis and management of pediatric AGE in Israel, based on the recently published European recommendations after adjustment to the Israeli setup.
METHODS: The recommendations arising from the systematic review of the literature were graded by level of evidence. The guidelines were endorsed by the Israeli associations of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Pediatrics.
RESULTS: The clinical signs with the predictive value for dehydration are weight loss, prolonged capillary refill, poor turgor, reduced urinary output and abnormal respiration. Routine stool or blood cultures are not recommended. Reduced or low osmolarity oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are the first line therapy for rehydration. Full diet, including lactose, should be resumed following the four hours required for rehydration. In most cases no medications are required for this self-limited disease but certain types of probiotics may shorten the diarrheal episode and reduce its severity. Antimicrobial therapy is not recommended in most cases but should be considered in shigellosis, during the first three days of campylobacter infectious and in other selected cases. Vaccination against rotavirus is recommended as per the recent European, American and Israeli guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of the scientific evidence in clinical practice, may improve the standard of care of pediatric AGE in Israel.","['Turner D', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Mimouni F', 'Shamir R']",2010,149,1,Harefuah,"Turner D, et al.

20351145,Global transcriptional response of macrophage-like THP-1 cells to Shiga toxin type 1.,"Shiga toxins (Stxs) are bacterial cytotoxins produced by the enteric pathogens Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 and some serotypes of Escherichia coli that cause bacillary dysentery and hemorrhagic colitis, respectively. To date, approaches to studying the capacity of Stxs to alter gene expression in intoxicated cells have been limited to individual genes. However, it is known that many of the signaling pathways activated by Stxs regulate the expression of multiple genes in mammalian cells. To expand the scope of analysis of gene expression and to better understand the underlying mechanisms for the various effects of Stxs on host cell functions, we carried out comparative microarray analyses to characterize the global transcriptional response of human macrophage-like THP-1 cells to Shiga toxin type 1 (Stx1) and lipopolysaccharides. The data were analyzed by using a rigorous combinatorial approach with three separate statistical algorithms. A total of 36 genes met the criteria of upregulated expression in response to Stx1 treatment, with 14 genes uniquely upregulated by Stx1. Microarray data were validated by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for genes encoding early growth response 1 (Egr-1) (transcriptional regulator), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2; inflammation), and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), DUSP5, and DUSP10 (regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling). Stx1-mediated signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Egr-1 appears to be involved in the increased expression and production of the proinflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor alpha. Activation of COX-2 is associated with the increased production of proinflammatory and vasoactive eicosanoids. However, the capacity of Stx1 to increase the expression of genes encoding phosphatases suggests that mechanisms to dampen the macrophage proinflammatory response may be built into host response to the toxins.","['Leyva-Illades D', 'Cherla RP', 'Galindo CL', 'Chopra AK', 'Tesh VL']",2010,78,6,Infect Immun,"Leyva-Illades D, et al.

20347884,Long-term downregulation of protease-activated receptor-2 expression in distal colon in rats following bacillary dysentery.,"The aim of this study was to determine changes of PAR-2 expression in distal colon and the sensitivity of colonic muscle to SLIGRL-NH2, the PAR-2-activating peptide (PAR-2-AP) following bacillary dysentery. Shigella flexneri was administrated intragastrically in healthy male rats to induce bacillary dysentery. The effect of SLIGRL-NH2 on the motility of colonic muscle strips were examined. The expression of PAR-2 was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Intragastric administration of S.flexneri induced acute inflammation at the mucosa of the distal colon at 4-11 days, and the inflammation disappeared 18 days later. PAR-2-AP-induced TTX insensitive relaxation of the colonic muscle strips. This inhibitory effect on colonic circular muscle strips was reduced on days 11-35, but the carbachol-induced contraction did not change. PAR-2 was located at the colon smooth muscles cells and myenteric nerve plexus. The amount of PAR-2 expression in distal colon was down regulated on days 11-35. These data indicated that bacillary dysentery exerted a long-term downregulation on the expression of PAR-2 in distal colon. This might be the reason of the low sensitivity of the colon circular muscle strips to the PAR-2-AP-induced relaxation following intragastric administration of S.flexneri.","['Luo Y', 'Wang F', 'Qin J', 'Feng M', 'Lv Y', 'Wang Q', 'Liu K', 'Liu C']",2010,163,1-3,Regul Pept,"Luo Y, et al.

METHODS: We defined a case as the occurrence of diarrhoea (> 3 loose stools/day) with fever or bloody stools in a resident of Gayeshpur in September-October 2007. We asked healthcare facilities to report cases, collected stool specimens from patients, constructed an epidemic curve, drew a map and calculated the incidence by age and sex. We also conducted a matched case-control study (58 in each group), calculated matched odds ratio (MOR) and population attributable fraction (PAF), as well as assessed the environment.
RESULTS: We identified 461 cases (attack rate: 46/1000 population) and isolated Shigella flexneri (serotype 2a and 3a) from 3 of 4 stool specimens. The attack rate was higher among females (52/1000) and those in the age group of 45-59 years (71/1000). The outbreak started on 22 September, peaked multiple times and subsided on 12 October 2007. Cases were clustered distal to a leaking pipeline that crossed an open drain to intermittently supply non-chlorinated water to taps. The 58 cases and 58 controls were matched for age and sex. Drinking tap water (MOR: 10; 95% CI: 3-32; PAF: 89%), washing utensils in tap water (MOR: 3.7; 95% CI: 1.2-11.3) and bathing in tap water (MOR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.1-11) were associated with the illness.
CONCLUSION: This outbreak of diarrhoea and Shigella flexneri dysentery was caused by contamination of tap water and subsided following repair of the pipeline. We recommended regular chlorination of the water and maintenance of pipelines.","['Saha T', 'Murhekar M', 'Hutin YJ', 'Ramamurthy T']",2009,22,5,Natl Med J India,"Saha T, et al.

20237205,High-throughput screening of the virulence regulator VirF: a novel antibacterial target for shigellosis.,"Shigella flexneri is a human enteropathogen that infects about 165 million people and claims more than 1 million lives per year worldwide. Although shigellosis has been considered a disease of the ""Third World,"" like many other contagious diseases, it does occur in developed countries. The emergence of drug and multidrug-resistant strains of Shigella emphasizes the need for novel antibiotic development. VirF, an AraC-type transcriptional regulator, is responsible for the expression of all downstream virulence factors that control intracellular invasion and cell-to-cell spread of Shigella. Gene knockout studies have validated that inhibition of VirF expression is sufficient to block the normal life cycle of Shigella in the host and thereby increase susceptibility to the host immune system. The authors have developed a high-throughput, cell-based assay to monitor inhibition of VirF using beta-galactosidase as a reporter protein. Using an avirulent strain of Shigella, they have screened libraries containing approximately 42,000 small molecules. Following confirmation and dose-response analysis, they have identified 7 compounds that demonstrate VirF inhibition in vivo >or=55% in comparison with the controls and little general antibacterial activity (measured by cell growth, OD(600)). The authors are in the process of confirming these ""hits"" in several secondary assays to assess the mechanism of action.","['Hurt JK', 'McQuade TJ', 'Emanuele A', 'Larsen MJ', 'Garcia GA']",2010,15,4,J Biomol Screen,"Hurt JK, et al.

20228623,A new paradigm of bacteria-gut interplay brought through the study of Shigella.,"Bacteria-gut epithelial interplay and the mucosal immune response are the most critical issues in determining the fate of bacterial infection and the severity of diseases. Shigella species (abbreviated here as Shigella), the causative agent of bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), are highly adapted human pathogens that are capable of invading and colonizing the intestinal epithelium, which results in severe inflammatory colitis. Shigella secrete a large and diverse number (more then 50) of effectors via the type III secretion system (TTSS) during infection, some of which are delivered into the surrounding bacterial space and some others into the host cell cytoplasm and nucleus. The delivered effectors mimic and usurp the host cellular functions, and modulate host cell signaling and immune response, thus playing pivotal roles in promoting bacterial infection and circumventing host defense systems. This article overviews the pathogenic characteristics of Shigella, and highlights current topics related to the bacterial infectious stratagem executed by the TTSS-secreted effectors. Though bacterial stratagems and the molecular mechanisms of infection vary greatly among pathogens, the current studies of Shigella provide a paradigm shift in bacterial pathogenesis.",['Sasakawa C'],2010,86,3,Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci,Sasakawa C.

In the present study, cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were challenged with various doses of S. dysenteriae 1 strain 1617 to establish a dose that would produce shigellosis. Further, different routes of delivery of S. dysenteriae 1 were compared to establish the most appropriate route for infection.

20150599,Impact of the discovery of human zinc deficiency on health.,"The essentiality of zinc was recognized 46 years ago. Zinc deficiency resulting in growth retardation, hypogonadism, immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment affects nearly 2 billion subjects in the developing world. High phytate content of the cereal proteins consumed in the developing world, results in decreased availability of zinc for absorption. Zinc therapy has been very successful and life saving measure in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica and Wilson's disease. Beneficial therapeutic responses of zinc supplementation have been ovserved in acute diarrhea in children, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, and common cold. Zinc supplementation was effective in decreasing incidences of infection in elderly and patients with sickle cell disease. Zinc supplementation was effective in preventing blindness in 25% of the elderly with dry type of age related macular degeneration. Zinc supplementation in the elderly decreased oxidative stress and decreased generation of inflammatory cytokines. Zinc is an intracellular signaling molecule in monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages and it plays an important role in cell-mediated immune functions and oxidative stress. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory agent. These unique properties of zinc may have significant therapeutic benefits in several diseases in humans. In many diseases concurrent zinc deficiency may complicate the clinical features, affect adversely immunological status, increase oxidative stress and increase generation of inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may play important causative roles in many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, several malignancies, neurological disorders, and auto-immune diseases. It is therefore, important that status of zinc is assessed and zinc deficiency corrected in these chronic diseases. A controlled clinical trial of zinc supplementation in these disorders in order to document the preventive and therapeutic effects of zinc is warranted.",['Prasad AS'],2009,28,3,J Am Coll Nutr,Prasad AS.

20113209,"Risk factors for sporadic shigellosis, FoodNet 2005.","BACKGROUND: An estimated 450,000 cases of shigellosis occur annually in the United States. Outbreaks have been associated with food, water, child daycare centers, and men who have sex with men. However, for sporadic infections, which account for the majority of cases, risk exposures are poorly characterized.
METHODS: Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) conducts active, laboratory-based shigellosis surveillance in 10 US sites. We interviewed cases with illness onset during 2005 about exposures during the week before symptom onset using a standardized questionnaire. The proportion of patients who denied nonfood risks was used to estimate the burden attributable to foodborne transmission.
RESULTS: Overall, 1494 cases were identified. The approximate incidence was 3.9/100,000, with the highest rates among children aged 1-4 years (16.4) and Hispanics (8.4). Of the 929 cases interviewed, 223 (24%) reported international travel in the week before symptom onset. Of the 626 nontraveling cases with complete risk factor information, 298 (48%) reported exposure to daycare or a household member with diarrhea; 99 (16%) reported drinking untreated water or recreational exposure to water; and 16 (3%) reported sexual contact with a person with diarrhea. Two hundred and fifty-nine (41%) denied all nonfood exposures examined.

Mild symptoms are self-limiting but in more severe cases, antibiotics are recommended for cure and preventing relapse. The antibiotics recommended are diverse, have regional differences in sensitivity, and have side effects.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for treating Shigella dysentery.
SEARCH STRATEGY: In June 2009 we identified all relevant trials from the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). We also checked conference proceedings for relevant abstracts, and contacted researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of antibiotics for Shigella dysentery.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four authors, working in pairs, independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and used the random-effects model for significant heterogeneity. We explored possible sources of heterogeneity, when present, in subgroup analyses of participant age and percentage of participants with confirmed Shigella infection.
MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials (1748 participants), spanning four decades and with differing sensitivity to Shigella isolates, met the inclusion criteria. Seven were judged to be at risk of bias due to inadequate allocation concealment or blinding, and 12 due to incomplete reporting of outcome data. Limited data from one three-armed trial of people with moderately severe illness suggest that antibiotics reduce the episodes of diarrhoea at follow-up (furazolidone versus no drug RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.48, 73 participants; cotrimoxazole versus no drug RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.59, 76 participants).There was insufficient evidence to consider any class of antibiotic superior in efficacy in treating Shigella dysentery, but heterogeneity for some comparisons limits confidence in the results. All the antibiotics studied were safe. There was inadequate evidence regarding the role of antibiotics in preventing relapses.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics reduce the duration of Shigella dysentery.Regularly updated local or regional antibiotic sensitivity patterns to different species and strains of Shigella are required to guide empiric therapy. More trials adhering to standard guidelines are required to evaluate the role of antibiotics in the treatment of severe forms of Shigella dysentery and in groups who are at high risk of complications.","['Prince Christopher R H', 'David KV', 'John SM', 'Sankarapandian V']",2010,,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Prince Christopher R H, et al.

20089698,Th17 cells are the dominant T cell subtype primed by Shigella flexneri mediating protective immunity.,"The T cell response to Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, remains poorly understood. Using a murine model of infection, we report that Shigella flexneri primes predominately IL-17A- and IL-22-producing Th17 cells. Shigella-specific Th1 cells are only significantly induced on secondary infection, whereas specific Th2 and CD8(+) T cells are undetectable. Apart from Th17 cells that are primed in a MHC class II- and IL-6-dependent, but IL12/23p40-independent manner, we identified gammadelta T cells as an additional but minor source of IL-17A. Priming of IL-17A(+) gammadelta T cells is dependent on IL12/23p40, but independent of MHC-class II and IL-6. Th17 cells have emerged as important players in inflammatory, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Among the yet unresolved questions is their role in long-term immunity to pathogens. In this study, we show that the elicited S. flexneri-specific Th17 pool gives rise to an enhanced recall response up to 12 mo after priming, suggesting the presence of a long-term memory state. The clearance of primary infection is impaired in the absence of T cells, but independently of IL-17A. However, after reinfection, IL-17A produced by S. flexneri-specific Th17 cells becomes important to ultimately restrict bacterial growth. These findings bring new insights into the adaptive immune response to Shigella infection and highlight the importance of pathogen-specific Th17 cell immunity for secondary immune protection.","['Sellge G', 'Magalhaes JG', 'Konradt C', 'Fritz JH', 'Salgado-Pabon W', 'Eberl G', 'Bandeira A', 'Di Santo JP', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Phalipon A']",2010,184,4,J Immunol,"Sellge G, et al.

20069106,Fever associated with gastrointestinal shigellosis unmasks probable brugada syndrome.,"Since it was first described approximately 15 years ago, the Brugada Syndrome has spurred a significant quantity of interest in its underlying mechanism and physiology. The Brugada electrocardiographic pattern is characterized by right bundle branch block morphology and ST segment elevations in the right precordial leads with an absence of identifiable underlying structural heart disease. The syndrome is clinically significant since these patients are at a higher risk of developing malignant ventricular arrhythmias. One of the mechanisms behind the disorder involves mutations in specific myocardial sodium channels. Furthermore, these electrocardiographic changes appear to be temperature dependent. We present the case of a 35-year-old male who presented with intestinal Shigellosis and was also found to have Brugada-type electrocardiographic changes on ECG. The electrocardiographic changes that were present when the patient was admitted and febrile resolved following antibiotic therapy and defervescence.","['Makaryus JN', 'Verbsky J', 'Schwartz S', 'Slotwiner D']",2009,2009,,Case Rep Med,"Makaryus JN, et al.

20056180,Age-related efficacy of Shigella O-specific polysaccharide conjugates in 1-4-year-old Israeli children.,"BACKGROUND: Despite its high worldwide morbidity and mortality, there is yet no licensed vaccine for shigellosis. We reported the safety and immunogenicity of Shigella O-specific polysaccharide-protein conjugates in adults and young children and efficacy of Shigella sonnei conjugate in young adults.
METHODS: A double-blinded, randomized and vaccine-controlled Phase 3 evaluation of S. sonnei and Shigella flexneri 2a O-SP-rEPA conjugates, 25 microg, injected IM twice, 6 weeks apart, into healthy 1-4 years old, is reported. The children were followed for 2 years by telephone every other week and stool cultures were obtained for each episode of acute diarrhea (> or =3 loose stools/day or a bloody/mucous stool). Sera were taken randomly from 10% of the participants for IgG anti-LPS and anti-carrier levels.
RESULTS: Of the 2799 enrollees, 1433 received S. sonnei and 1366 S. flexneri 2a conjugates; 2699 (96.4%) completed the 2-year follow-up. Local reactions occurred in approximately 5% and approximately 4% had temperatures > or =38.0 degrees C lasting 1-2 days. There were no serious adverse events attributable to the vaccines. Of the 3295 stool cultures obtained, 125 yielded S. sonnei and 21 S. flexneri 2a. Immunogenicity and efficacy were age-related. The overall efficacy of the S. sonnei conjugate was 27.5%; 71.1% (P=0.043) in the 3-4 years old. The numbers for S. flexneri 2a were too few for meaningful analysis. Cross-protection by S. flexneri 2a for non-vaccine S. flexneri types was found, but the numbers were too few for statistical significance. There was an age-related rise of vaccine-specific IgG anti-LPS in both groups, peaking at about 10 weeks and declining thereafter, but remaining > or =4-fold higher than in the controls 2 years after the second dose.
CONCLUSIONS: Shigella conjugates are safe and immunogenic in 1-4 years old. The S. sonnei conjugate elicited 71.1% efficacy in the 3-4 years old and can be predicted to be efficacious in individuals older than 3 years of age. These results urge studies with our improved conjugates.","['Passwell JH', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Banet-Levi Y', 'Ramon-Saraf R', 'Farzam N', 'Lerner-Geva L', 'Even-Nir H', 'Yerushalmi B', 'Chu C', 'Shiloach J', 'Robbins JB', 'Schneerson R', 'Israeli Shigella Study Group']",2010,28,10,Vaccine,"Passwell JH, et al.

20046513,Increased immunoendocrine cells in intestinal mucosa of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome patients 3 years after acute Shigella infection--an observation in a small case control study.,"PURPOSE: Postinfectiously irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) develops in 3-30% of individuals with bacterial gastroenteritis. Recent studies demonstrated increases in inflammatory components in gut mucosa of PI-IBS patients even after complete resolution of infection. We aimed to investigate histological changes in colon and rectum of PI-IBS subjects after long term period of infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited PI-IBS subjects who had been diagnosed IBS after complete resolution of enteritis caused by shigellosis outbreak 3 years earlier. We compared unmatched four groups, PI-IBS (n = 4), non PI-IBS (n = 7), D-IBS (n = 7, diarrhea predominant type) and healthy controls (n = 10). All of them underwent colonoscopic biopsy at three areas, including descending colon (DC), sigmoid colon (SC) and rectum, which were assessed for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)/peptide YY (PYY)-containing enterochromaffin (EC) cell, intraepithelial (IEL) and lamina propria T lymphocyte (CD3), CD8 lymphocytes, mast cells and CD68/calprotectin+ macrophages.
RESULTS: All subjects had no structural or gross abnormalities at colonoscopy. In PI-IBS, 5-HT containing EC cells, PYY containing EC cells, IELs, CD3 lymphocytes, CD8 lymphocytes, mast cells, and CD68 + macrophages were increased compared to control (p < 0.05). In D-IBS, PYY containing EC cells, IELs, and CD3 lymphocytes were increased compared to control (p < 0.05). In PI-IBS, 5-HT containing EC cells tended to increase and PYY containing EC cells, CD8 lymphocytes, mast cells, and CD68+ macrophages were increased compared to non PI-IBS (p < 0.05). Calprotectin + marcrophages were decreased in PI-IBS, non PI-IBS and IBS compared to control.
CONCLUSION: The immunoendocrine cells were sporadically increased in PI-IBS, non PI-IBS and D-IBS compared with control. Our findings in a very small number of patients suggest that mucosal inflammation may play a role in long-term PI-IBS, and that other sub-groups of IBS and larger scale studies are needed to confirm this observation.","['Kim HS', 'Lim JH', 'Park H', 'Lee SI']",2010,51,1,Yonsei Med J,"Kim HS, et al.

20016394,Characteristics of children with Shigella encephalopathy: experience from a large urban diarrhea treatment center in Bangladesh.,"BACKGROUND: Encephalopathy is a serious neurologic complication from shigellosis often with fatal outcome but data on simple clinical and sociodemographic predicting factors are limited. We sought to identify those factors in children.
METHODS: In this unmatched case-control design, children of both sexes, aged 0 to 15 years having positive stool culture for Shigella from 1997 to 2006 were studied. Children with Shigella encephalopathy constituted the cases (n = 29), whereas randomly selected children with shigellosis having no encephalopathy constituted controls (n = 87).
RESULTS: The case-fatality was significantly higher among the cases than among controls (7% vs. 0%, RR: 4.2, CI: 3.0-5.9, P = 0.013). In logistic regression analysis, children with Shigella encephalopathy more often had an illiterate father (OR: 5.4, 95% CI: 1.1-27.1, P = 0.038), stopped breast-feeding in the neonatal period (OR: 41.3, 95% CI: 4.2-403.1, P = 0.001), had dehydrating diarrhea (OR: 9.9, 95% CI: 2.1-45.9, P = 0.004) with a duration of <1 day (OR: 29.4, 95% CI: 2.1-43.2, P = 0.004), and were more likely to be severely stunted (OR: 6.4, 95% CI: 1.2-34.9, P = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Education of parents about the value of exclusive breast-feeding and of prompt hydration in children with Shigella is critical to minimize morbidity and deaths.","['Chisti MJ', 'Faruque AS', 'Khan WA', 'Das SK', 'Zabed MB', 'Salam MA']",2010,29,5,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Chisti MJ, et al.

20011051,The immunogenic SigA enterotoxin of Shigella flexneri 2a binds to HEp-2 cells and induces fodrin redistribution in intoxicated epithelial cells.,"BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that the enterotoxin SigA which resides on the she pathogenicity island (PAI) of S. flexneri 2a is an autonomously secreted serine protease capable of degrading casein. We have also demonstrated that SigA is cytopathic for HEp-2 cells and plays a role in the intestinal fluid accumulation associated with S. flexneri infections.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work we show that SigA binds specifically to HEp-2 cells and degrades recombinant human alphaII spectrin (alpha-fodrin) in vitro, suggesting that the cytotoxic and enterotoxic effects mediated by SigA are likely associated with the degradation of epithelial fodrin. Consistent with our data, this study also demonstrates that SigA cleaves intracellular fodrin in situ, causing its redistribution within cells. These results strongly implicate SigA in altering the cytoskeleton during the pathogenesis of shigellosis. On the basis of these findings, cleavage of fodrin is a novel mechanism of cellular intoxication for a Shigella toxin. Furthermore, information regarding immunogenicity to SigA in infected patients is lacking. We studied the immune response of SigA from day 28 post-challenge serum of one volunteer from S. flexneri 2a challenge studies. Our results demonstrate that SigA is immunogenic following infection with S. flexneri 2a.
CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that SigA binds to epithelial HEp-2 cells as well as being able to induce fodrin degradation in vitro and in situ, further extending its documented role in the pathogenesis of Shigella infections.","['Al-Hasani K', 'Navarro-Garcia F', 'Huerta J', 'Sakellaris H', 'Adler B']",2009,4,12,PLoS One,"Al-Hasani K, et al.

20009283,"Trends in antimicrobial resistance in Shigella species in Karachi, Pakistan.","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is a common cause of morbidity, especially in the very young and old, in developing countries. The disease is treated with antibiotics. Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance trends is essential owing to the global emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
METHODOLOGY: The study involved 1,573 isolates of Shigella species (1996-2007) that were analyzed for trends in antimicrobial resistance.
RESULTS: The majority of the specimens (1046; 66.5%) were from the pediatric population, and of these 887 (84.8%) were under 5 years of age (p = 0.001). S. flexineri was the most frequent species (54.5%) isolated. Isolation of S. sonnei increased from 15.4 % (1996) to 39% (2007) (p = 0.001). Although none of the isolates was found sensitive to all the antibiotics tested, 58% (n =9 07) were resistant to ampicillin and 85% (n = 1,338) were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Out of a total of 198 (12.6%) nalidixic acid resistant isolates, 6 (3.0%) were also resistant to ofloxacin. Overall 1.7 % of isolates were resistant to ofloxacin, 2.4% to ceftriaxone and 2.3% were resistant to combination of ampicillin, nalidixic acid and TMP-SMX.
CONCLUSION: Ofloxacin is still an effective drug for treatment of acute shigellosis in Pakistan. Emergence of resistance to ceftriaxone in Shigella may have grave implications in treatment of severe shigellosis in very young patients.","['Khan E', 'Jabeen K', 'Ejaz M', 'Siddiqui J', 'Shezad MF', 'Zafar A']",2009,3,10,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Khan E, et al.

20003464,"A changing picture of shigellosis in southern Vietnam: shifting species dominance, antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical presentation.","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis remains considerable public health problem in some developing countries. The nature of Shigellae suggests that they are highly adaptable when placed under selective pressure in a human population. This is demonstrated by variation and fluctuations in serotypes and antimicrobial resistance profile of organisms circulating in differing setting in endemic locations. Antimicrobial resistance in the genus Shigella is a constant threat, with reports of organisms in Asia being resistant to multiple antimicrobials and new generation therapies.
METHODS: Here we compare microbiological, clinical and epidemiological data from patients with shigellosis over three different periods in southern Vietnam spanning 14 years.
RESULTS: Our data demonstrates a shift in dominant infecting species (S. flexneri to S. sonnei) and resistance profile of the organisms circulating in southern Vietnam. We find that there was no significant variation in the syndromes associated with either S. sonnei or S. flexneri, yet the clinical features of the disease are more severe in later observations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a change in clinical presentation of shigellosis in this setting, as the disease may be now more pronounced, this is concurrent with a change in antimicrobial resistance profile. These data highlight the socio-economic development of southern Vietnam and should guide future vaccine development and deployment strategies.

19955273,Emergence of a new multidrug-resistant serotype X variant in an epidemic clone of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella spp. are the causative agent of shigellosis with Shigella flexneri serotype 2a being the most prevalent in developing countries. Epidemiological surveillance in China found that a new serotype of S. flexneri appeared in 2001 and replaced serotype 2a in 2003 as the most prevalent serotype in Henan Province. The new serotype also became the dominant serotype in 7 of the 10 other provinces under surveillance in China by 2007. The serotype was identified as a variant of serotype X. It differs from serotype X by agglutination to the monovalent anti-IV type antiserum and the group antigen-specific monoclonal antibody MASF IV-I. Genome sequencing of a serotype X variant isolate, 2002017, showed that it acquired a Shigella serotype conversion island, also as an SfX bacteriophage, containing gtr genes for type X-specific glucosylation. Multilocus sequence typing of 15 genes from 37 serotype X variant isolates and 69 isolates of eight other serotypes, 1a, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5b, X, and Y, found that all belong to a new sequence type (ST), ST91. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 154 pulse types with 655 S. flexneri isolates analyzed and identified 57 serotype switching events. The data suggest that S. flexneri epidemics in China have been caused by a single epidemic clone, ST91, with frequent serotype switching to evade infection-induced immunity to serotypes to which the population was exposed previously. The clone has also acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics. These findings underscore the challenges to the current vaccine development and control strategies for shigellosis.","['Ye C', 'Lan R', 'Xia S', 'Zhang J', 'Sun Q', 'Zhang S', 'Jing H', 'Wang L', 'Li Z', 'Zhou Z', 'Zhao A', 'Cui Z', 'Cao J', 'Jin D', 'Huang L', 'Wang Y', 'Luo X', 'Bai X', 'Wang Y', 'Wang P', 'Xu Q', 'Xu J']",2010,48,2,J Clin Microbiol,"Ye C, et al.

19932216,"Characterization of WRSs2 and WRSs3, new second-generation virG(icsA)-based Shigella sonnei vaccine candidates with the potential for reduced reactogenicity.","Live, attenuated Shigella vaccine candidates, such as Shigella sonnei strain WRSS1, Shigella flexneri 2a strain SC602, and Shigella dysenteriae 1 strain WRSd1, are attenuated principally by the loss of the VirG(IcsA) protein. These candidates have proven to be safe and immunogenic in volunteer trials and in one study, efficacious against shigellosis. One drawback of these candidate vaccines has been the reactogenic symptoms of fever and diarrhea experienced by the volunteers, that increased in a dose-dependent manner. New, second-generation virG(icsA)-based S. sonnei vaccine candidates, WRSs2 and WRSs3, are expected to be less reactogenic while retaining the ability to generate protective levels of immunogenicity seen with WRSS1. Besides the loss of VirG(IcsA), WRSs2 and WRSs3 also lack plasmid-encoded enterotoxin ShET2-1 and its paralog ShET2-2. WRSs3 further lacks MsbB2 that reduces the endotoxicity of the lipid A portion of the bacterial LPS. Studies in cell cultures and in gnotobiotic piglets demonstrate that WRSs2 and WRSs3 have the potential to cause less diarrhea due to loss of ShET2-1 and ShET2-2 as well as alleviate febrile symptoms by loss of MsbB2.

19925531,Multiple sclerosis in the Faroe Islands. 8. Notifiable diseases.,"OBJECTIVE: To seek evidence for a possible infectious origin of the type 1 epidemic of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the Faroe Islands. This began in 1943 coincident with their British military occupation throughout World War II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data obtained from the Danish National Health Service were assessed for all notifiable diseases in the Faroe Islands reported from 1900 to 1977.
RESULTS: Among 38 disorders, selective increases were found for acute infectious gastroenteritis (AIGE) and paradysentery, with outbreaks in late 1940 and in 1943 shortly after the introduction and later marked influx, respectively, of British troops. Five other infections showed elevated numbers in 1941 and 1942.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a temporal association of AIGE and paradysentery in the Faroe Islands with the first arrival and later marked augmentation of British forces stationed there during the war. Rises in the incidence of other diseases in 1941-1942 seem more likely a consequence of increased foreign commercial travel by Faroese at that time.","['Wallin MT', 'Heltberg A', 'Kurtzke JF']",2010,122,2,Acta Neurol Scand,"Wallin MT, et al.

However, they are difficult to identify and differentiate by biochemical tests or molecular methods alone. In this study, we developed a procedure to detect Shigella spp. and EIEC from environmental water samples using membrane filtration followed by nutrient broth enrichment, isolation using selective culture plates, and identification of the invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Finally, we used a biochemical test and a serological assay to differentiate between Shigella and EIEC. Among the 93 water samples from nine reservoirs and one watershed, 76 (81.7%) water samples of culture plates had candidate colonies of Shigella and EIEC and 5 water samples were positive (5.4%) for a Shigella- and EIEC-specific polymerase chain reaction targeting the ipaH gene.

RESULTS: During this period 9.083 shigellosis infections were registered, 51,9% of them in 202 shigellosis outbreaks. The leading way of transmission was contact, but water- and food-borne outbreaks were also detected The average number of infections in contact outbreaks of shigellosis was small--6.3 infections. The highest average is in water-borne outbreaks--55.1. Most of the outbreaks were those occuring in families (47.5%) and most of them were registered in august.
DISCUSSION: Shigellosis has been mandatory reported in the AP of Vojvodina since 1945 and results of outbreak investigation of this disease were analyzed since 1979. In the first half of this period water was the most common way of agent transmission in shigellosis outbreaks, but in recent 15 years the contact became the leading one. In the last 5 years there was no water-borne shigellosis outbreaks. Almost one third of all outbreaks were imported from Montenegro and Croatia by tourists coming back from those countries. Most of the outbreaks are small outbreaks occuring in families, primarily transmitted by contact. Outbreaks in facilities for care of disabled children and elders are also important. Sh. sonnei and Sh. flexneri are the two serotypes identified, the former in 57.4% and the latter in 40.1% outbreaks.
CONCLUSION: Shigellosis is a disease occurring in the AP of Vojvodina primarily in small outbreaks inside families, transmitted by contact, most often in August and more often caused by Sh. sonnei. Health promotion and strict use of general measures of disease control and prevention are important.","['Durić P', 'Stefanović S', 'Petrović V', 'Cosić G']",2009,62,7-8,Med Pregl,"Durić P, et al.

19894214,How to replace the residual solvation shell of polar active site residues to achieve nanomolar inhibition of tRNA-guanine transglycosylase.,"In a computational and structural study, we investigated a series of 4-substituted lin-benzoguanines that are potent inhibitors of tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a putative target for the treatment of shigellosis. At first glance, it appears self-evident that the placement of a positively charged ligand functional group between the carboxylate groups of two adjacent aspartate residues in the glycosylase catalytic center leads to enhanced ligand binding. The concomitant displacement of water molecules that partially solvate the aspartates prior to ligand binding appears to result as a consequence of this. However, the case study presented herein shows that this premise is much too superficial. Placement of a likely positively charged amino group at such a pivotal position, interfering with the residual water solvation shell, is at best cost-neutral compared with the unsubstituted parent ligand not conflicting with the residual water shell. A ligand that orients a hydroxy group in this position shows even decreased binding. Based on the cost-neutral placement of the amino functionality, hydrophobic side chains can now be further attached to fill, with increasing potency, a small hydrophobic pocket remote to the aspartates. Any attempts to cross the pivotal position between both aspartates with nonpolar scaffolds reveals only decreased binding, even though the waters of the residual solvation shell are successfully repelled. This surprising observation fostered a detailed analysis of the role of water molecules involved in the residual solvation of polar active site residues. Their geometry and putative replacement in the binding pocket of TGT has been studied by a comparative database analysis, computational active site mapping, and a series of crystal structure analyses. Furthermore, conformational preferences of attached hydrophobic moieties explain their contribution to a gradual increase in binding affinity.","['Ritschel T', 'Kohler PC', 'Neudert G', 'Heine A', 'Diederich F', 'Klebe G']",2009,4,12,ChemMedChem,"Ritschel T, et al.

19821387,Antibiotic therapy for Shigella dysentery.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella dysentery is a relatively common illness and occasionally causes death, worldwide. Mild symptoms are self-limiting but in more severe cases, antibiotics are recommended for cure and preventing relapse. The antibiotics recommended are diverse, have regional differences in sensitivity, and have side effects.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for treating Shigella dysentery.
SEARCH STRATEGY: In June 2009 we identified all relevant trials from the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). We also checked conference proceedings for relevant abstracts, and contacted researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of antibiotics for Shigella dysentery.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four authors, working in pairs, independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and used the random-effects model for significant heterogeneity. We explored possible sources of heterogeneity, when present, in subgroup analyses of participant age and percentage of participants with confirmed Shigella infection.
MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials (1748 participants), spanning four decades and with differing sensitivity to Shigella isolates, met the inclusion criteria. Seven were judged to be at risk of bias due to inadequate allocation concealment or blinding, and 12 due to incomplete reporting of outcome data. Limited data from one three-armed trial of people with moderately severe illness suggest that antibiotics reduce the episodes of diarrhoea at follow-up (furazolidone versus no drug RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.48, 73 participants; cotrimoxazole versus no drug RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.59, 76 participants).There was insufficient evidence to consider any class of antibiotic superior in efficacy in treating Shigella dysentery, but heterogeneity for some comparisons limits confidence in the results. All the antibiotics studied were safe. There was inadequate evidence regarding the role of antibiotics in preventing relapses.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics reduce the duration of Shigella dysentery.Regularly updated local or regional antibiotic sensitivity patterns to different species and strains of Shigella are required to guide empiric therapy. More trials adhering to standard guidelines are required to evaluate the role of antibiotics in the treatment of severe forms of Shigella dysentery and in groups who are at high risk of complications.","['Christopher PR', 'David KV', 'John SM', 'Sankarapandian V']",2009,,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Christopher PR, et al.

We present the first comprehensive proteome analysis of this pathogen, profiling proteins from bacteria cultured in vitro and bacterial isolates from the large bowel of infected gnotobiotic piglets (in vivo). Overall, 1061 distinct gene products were identified. Differential display analysis revealed that SD1 cells switched to an anaerobic energy metabolism in vivo. High in vivo abundances of amino acid decarboxylases (GadB and AdiA) which enhance pH homeostasis in the cytoplasm and protein disaggregation chaperones (HdeA, HdeB and ClpB) were indicative of a coordinated bacterial survival response to acid stress. Several type III secretion system effectors were increased in abundance in vivo, including OspF, IpaC and IpaD. These proteins are implicated in invasion of colonocytes and subversion of the host immune response in S. flexneri. These observations likely reflect an adaptive response of SD1 to the hostile host environment. Seven proteins, among them the type III secretion system effectors OspC2 and IpaB, were detected as antigens in Western blots using piglet antisera. The outer membrane protein OmpA, the heat shock protein HtpG and OspC2 represent novel SD1 subunit vaccine candidates and drug targets.","['Pieper R', 'Zhang Q', 'Parmar PP', 'Huang ST', 'Clark DJ', 'Alami H', 'Donohue-Rolfe A', 'Fleischmann RD', 'Peterson SN', 'Tzipori S']",2009,9,22,Proteomics,"Pieper R, et al.

19812985,Shigella infection of intestinal epithelium and circumvention of the host innate defense system.,"Shigella, Gram-negative bacteria closely related to Escherichia coli, are highly adapted human pathogens that cause bacillary dysentery. Although Shigella have neither adherence factors nor flagella required for attaching or accessing the intestinal epithelium, Shigella are capable of colonizing the intestinal epithelium by exploiting epithelial-cell functions and circumventing the host innate immune response. During Shigella infection, they deliver many numbers of effectors through the type III secretion system into the surrounding space and directly into the host-cell cytoplasm. The effectors play pivotal roles from the onset of bacterial infection through to the establishment of the colonization of the intestinal epithelium, such as bacterial invasion, intracellular survival, subversion of the host immune defense response, and maintenance of the infectious foothold. These examples suggest that Shigella have evolved highly sophisticated infectious and intracellular strategies to establish replicative niches in the intestinal epithelium.","['Ashida H', 'Ogawa M', 'Mimuro H', 'Sasakawa C']",2009,337,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"Ashida H, et al.

19805534,Spa15 of Shigella flexneri is secreted through the type III secretion system and prevents staurosporine-induced apoptosis.,"Shigella flexneri is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen that invades the colonic epithelium and causes bacillary dysentery. We previously demonstrated that S. flexneri inhibits staurosporine-induced apoptosis in infected epithelial cells and that a DeltamxiE mutant is unable to inhibit apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that an MxiE-regulated gene was responsible for protection of epithelial cells from apoptosis. Analysis of all MxiE-regulated genes yielded no mutants that lacked the ability to prevent apoptosis. Spa15, which is defined as a type III secretion system chaperone, was analyzed since it associates with MxiE. A Deltaspa15 mutant was unable to prevent staurosporine-induced apoptosis. C-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged spa15 was secreted by S. flexneri within 2 h in the Congo red secretion assay, and secretion was dependent on the type III secretion system. Spa15 was also secreted by Shigella in infected epithelial cells, as verified by immunofluorescence analysis. Spa15 secretion was decreased in the DeltamxiE mutant, which demonstrates why this mutant is unable to prevent staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Our data are the first to show that Spa15 is secreted in a type III secretion system-dependent fashion, and the absence of Spa15 in the Deltaspa15 mutant results in the loss of protection from staurosporine-induced apoptosis in epithelial cells. Thus, Spa15 contributes to the intracellular survival of Shigella by blocking apoptosis in the infected host cell.","['Faherty CS', 'Maurelli AT']",2009,77,12,Infect Immun,Faherty CS and Maurelli AT.

19802566,Autophagy in immunity against intracellular bacteria.,"Autophagy is an innate immune defense mechanism against various intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri. S. typhimurium uses type three secretion systems (T3SSs) to invade mammalian cells and replicate in Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs). A small population of intracellular S. typhimurium is targeted by autophagy shortly after infection. Evidence suggests that these bacteria are present within SCVs that have been damaged by high levels of T3SS activity. Autophagy limits the growth of S. typhimurium in host cells. Therefore, autophagy can be considered to protect the cytosol of eukaryotic cells from bacterial colonization. L. monocytogenes secretes the pore-forming cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) to disrupt the phagosome and escape into the cytosol, where it acquires actin-based motility. Autophagy can target L. monocytogenes in the cytosol under specific experimental conditions. However, L. monocytogenes utilizes several virulence factors to evade being killed by the autophagy system. A newly appreciated population of L. monocytogenes undergoes slow growth in specialized vacuoles termed spacious Listeria-containing phagosomes (SLAPs), the formation of which requires bacterial LLO and host autophagy. In the cytosol, S. flexneri can also be a target for autophagy in the absence of a T3SS effector, IcsB, that normally impairs the interaction between Atg5 and wild-type bacteria. Therefore, autophagy can recognize intracellular bacteria in a variety of ways, leading to different fates for these bacteria in host cells. The inefficient autophagy of enteric bacteria in genetically compromised individuals may contribute to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.","['Huang J', 'Brumell JH']",2009,335,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Huang J and Brumell JH.

We describe and evaluate the use of an electronic laboratory data system (WHONET) and a space-time permutation scan statistic for semi-automated disease outbreak detection. In collaboration with WHONET-Argentina, the national network for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, we applied the system to the detection of local and regional outbreaks of Shigella spp. We searched for clusters on the basis of genus, species, and resistance phenotype and identified 19 statistical 'events' in a 12-month period. Of the six known outbreaks reported to the Ministry of Health, four had good or suggestive agreement with SaTScan-detected events. The most discriminating analyses were those involving resistance phenotypes.

19759494,Molecular characterization of ESBL-producing Shigella sonnei isolates from patients with bacilliary dysentery in Lebanon.,"BACKGROUND: Emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Shigella species imparting resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is a growing concern worldwide. The aim of this study is to molecularly characterize the newly emerging beta-lactam resistant Shigella sonnei, specifically ESBLs in Lebanon, and compare them to beta-lactam sensitive isolates.
METHODOLOGY: We compared five beta-lactam-resistant S. sonnei isolates to six isolates susceptible to beta-lactams. Presence of ESBLs was established by the combination disk method. PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the beta-lactamase-encoding genes, along with other antimicrobial resistance genes, were performed. The localization of beta-lactamase genes was established by conjugation experiments. Beta-lactamase gene transcription levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Molecular typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
RESULTS: Four of five beta-lactam resistant isolates were extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers. These harbored the bla-CTX-M-15 gene borne on a 70 Kb plasmid and class 2 integron genes on their chromosomes. The bla-CTX-M-15 gene was flanked by an insertion element ISEcp1. A chromosomal bla-TEM-1 gene was detected in one beta-lactam resistant Shigella isolate and two of the ESBL producing isolates. The bla-CTX-M-15 gene transcription levels were increased in EBSL isolates exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of ceftazidime. PFGE analysis revealed that the four bla-CTX-M-15 positive isolates were nonclonal but two of them shared genotypes with -lactam susceptible isolates.
CONCLUSION: Dissemination of broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance in Shigella sonnei is mediated by bla-CTX-M-15 through horizontal plasmid transfer rather than by clonal spread of the resistant isolates. Expression of this gene is further induced in the presence of ceftazidime.","['Sabra AH', 'Araj GF', 'Kattar MM', 'Abi-Rached RY', 'Khairallah MT', 'Klena JD', 'Matar GM']",2009,3,4,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Sabra AH, et al.

The aim of this study was to isolate enteric pathogenic bacteria from fish that might be transmitted to humans after the handling or consumption of such fish.
METHODOLOGY: One hundred and twenty Nile tilapia fish harvested using various fishing methods were collected from fishermen in five fish landing beaches within Winam Gulf and disinfected externally using 70% ethyl alcohol for 2 minutes then washed three times with autoclaved distilled water. Isolation of Salmonella and Shigella species from fish samples was performed using standard bacteriological procedures. Five milliliters of each fish tissue slurry was microbiologically analyzed for any Enterobacteriaceae. Twelve Nile tilapia collected from three open-air markets were analyzed for Enterobacteriaceae comparison as controls. Identification of Salmonella by using housekeeping genes and species-specific primers was performed.
RESULTS: Among 120 Nile tilapia, 63 (52.5%) were infected with Enterobacteriaceae. Out of these, 25 (39.7%) were Shigella spp, 9 (14.3%) Salmonella typhimurium, 7 (11.1%) S. typhi, 4 (6.3%) S. enteritidis, 16 (25.4%) Escherichia coli, 1 (1.6%) Proteus spp. and Enterobacter aerogenes respectively.

19750823,"[Waterborne diseases outbreaks in the Czech Republic, 1995-2005].","Despite considerable advances in drinking water safety assurance and adherence to the public health standards, waterborne diaseases outbreaks have still been observed even in industrialized countries. The study objective was to map such outbreaks in the Czech Republic in 1995-2005. In this study, an outbreak is the occurrence of more cases of disease than normally expected within a specific place over a given period of time and a waterborne disease is a disease where water is the vehicle or source of infection. The data on waterborne outbreaks was obtained from the EPIDAT database (national infectious diseases reporting system) information provided by epidemiologists of all regional public health authorities and the National Reference Laboratory for Legionella. In 1995 - 2005, 33 outbreaks with water indicated as the route of transmission were recorded in the Czech Republic. The leading cause was unsafe drinking water (27 outbreaks), mainly from wells (19 outbreaks); nevertheless, the most serious consequences were observed in two outbreaks caused by microbiologically contaminated hot water. Other sources of waterborne infection were mineral water springs, a swimming pool and a brook. The total of reported cases of waterborne diseases was 1655, 356 hospitalisations and ten deaths due to legionellosis were recorded. The highest number of outbreaks (7) as well as the highest number of cases (841) were reported in 1997. Comparison of two five-year periods, i.e. 1996-2000 and 2001-2005, showed a nearly one third decrease in the total of outbreaks and a half reduction in the total of cases in the latter. In view of the limited length of monitoring, it is not possible to say with certainty whether it is a random distribution or an actual trend. Almost two thirds of cases were diagnosed as acute gastroenteritis of probable infectious origin and other frequent waterborne diseases were viral hepatitis A and bacillary dysentery. When analyzing the described outbreaks, it should be taken into account that only the diagnosed and reported outbreak cases are covered, while the actual number of cases is likely to be underreported. Although no evidence is available that any vast and serious waterborne diseases outbreaks escaped reporting, some small and less serious outbreaks may have occurred unnoticed. In the future, the diagnosis, investigation and evaluation of waterborne diseases outbreaks should be improved, among others by implementing an evidence-based classification system and issuing regular surveys of outbreaks and their causes which would be helpful in preventing failures in other similar water sources.","['Kozísek F', 'Jeligová H', 'Dvoráková A']",2009,58,3,Epidemiol Mikrobiol Imunol,"Kozísek F, et al.

The disease is most prevalent in developing countries with poor access to safe potable water and sanitation. Shigella boydii is of particular epidemiological importance in developing nations such as African and Asian countries. In the present study, we report on the analysis of a temporal cluster of 29 S. boydii serotype 2 strains, isolated in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa (SA) over the period of November to December 2007.
METHODOLOGY: Bacteria were identified as S. boydii using standard microbiological identification techniques and serotyped using commercially available antisera. Susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents was determined by the Etest. Genotypic relatedness of strains was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of digested genomic DNA.
RESULTS: The cluster of 29 isolates revealed comparable antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, while dendrogram analysis of PFGE patterns showed that the cluster of isolates grouped together and could clearly be differentiated from a random selection of unrelated S. boydii serotype 2 strains. Our data has strongly suggested that this cluster of isolates may share a common ancestry. However, this cannot be substantiated by epidemiological data because a detailed epidemiological investigation was not conducted.
CONCLUSIONS: We have documented the first cluster of S. boydii infection in SA. Due to the lack of adequate epidemiological investigation, we cannot emphatically state that an outbreak had occurred. However, we do hypothesis that this was an outbreak for which a waterborne source cannot be excluded. This study has highlighted the urgent need for timely and appropriate systems of epidemiological investigation of all suspected outbreaks of disease in developing countries.","['Smith AM', 'Keddy KH', 'Sooka A', 'Ismail H', 'Dejong GM', 'Group for Enteric, Respiratory and Miningeal Disease Surveillance in South Africa (GERMS-SA)']",2009,3,1,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Smith AM, et al.

19746363,High-affinity inhibitors of tRNA-guanine transglycosylase replacing the function of a structural water cluster.,"The tRNA-modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is essential for the pathogenic mechanism of Shigella flexneri, the causing agent of the bacterial diarrheal disease shigellosis. Herein, the synthesis of a new class of rationally designed 6-amino-imidazo[4,5-g]quinazolin-8(7H)-one- (lin-benzoguanine) based inhibitors of TGT are reported. In order to accommodate a small hydrophobic crevice opening near the binding site of ribose-34, 2-aminoethyl substituents were introduced in position 4 of the heterocyclic scaffold. For this purpose, a synthetic sequence consisting of iodination, Suzuki cross-coupling, hydroboration, Mitsunobu reaction, and Gabriel synthesis was employed, furnishing a primary amine that served as a common intermediate for the preparation of a series of derivatives. The resulting ligands displayed very low inhibition constants, down to K(i)=2 nM. Substantial additional inhibitory potency is gained by interaction of terminal lipophilic groups attached to the substituent at position 4 with the hydrophobic crevice shaped by Val45 and Leu68. At the same time, the secondary ammonium center in the substituent displaces a cluster of water molecules, solvating the catalytic residues Asp102 and Asp280, without loss in binding affinity. In addition, a synthetic intermediate with an unusual 3,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydroimidazo[4,5-g][1,3]benzodiazepine core, as confirmed by X-ray analysis, is reported.","['Kohler PC', 'Ritschel T', 'Schweizer WB', 'Klebe G', 'Diederich F']",2009,15,41,Chemistry,"Kohler PC, et al.

19738503,Transmission risk factors and treatment of pediatric shigellosis during a large daycare center-associated outbreak of multidrug resistant Shigella sonnei: implications for the management of shigellosis outbreaks among children.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis outbreaks in daycare centers result in substantial disease and economic burdens in the United States. The emergence of multidrug resistant Shigella strains raises questions regarding control of transmission within daycare centers and treatment for children. From May to October 2005, 639 Shigella sonnei cases were reported in northwest Missouri, mostly among persons exposed to daycare centers.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control investigation among licensed daycare centers (LDCs) in northwest Missouri to determine transmission risk factors, tested isolates for antimicrobial resistance, and described treatment practices. Case LDCs had secondary attack rates of shigellosis>or=2% (range, 2%-25%) and control LDCs<or=2% (range, 0%-1.3%). We interviewed LDC staff and performed on-site inspections. Thirty-one outbreak isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance. We interviewed physicians and reviewed health department outbreak-related treatment data.
RESULTS: We enrolled 18 case and 21 control LDCs. LDCs with >or=1 sink in every room (odds ratio [OR]: 0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02-0.5) or a diapering station in every room (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.01-0.6) were less likely to be case-LDCs. Resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found in 90% of the outbreak strains. Among 210 children treated with antimicrobial agents, azithromycin was used in 92 (44%) while a fluoroquinolone was used in 11 (5%) children.
CONCLUSIONS: During a large daycare center-associated shigellosis outbreak, strains were highly resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Children were frequently treated with azithromycin and occasionally fluoroquinolones. Appropriate handwashing and diapering infrastructure are necessary to minimize spread of shigellosis within daycare centers, and could reduce use of antimicrobial agents.","['Arvelo W', 'Hinkle CJ', 'Nguyen TA', 'Weiser T', 'Steinmuller N', 'Khan F', 'Gladbach S', 'Parsons M', 'Jennings D', 'Zhu BP', 'Mintz E', 'Bowen A']",2009,28,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Arvelo W, et al.

19736408,Magnitude of drug resistant Shigellosis: a report from Bangalore.,"Shigella is an important cause of acute invasive diarrhea in children and others. Antimicrobial susceptibility of Shigella spp. isolated from diarrhoeal/ dysenteric patients in Bangalore was studied in our hospital from January 2002 to December 2007. One hundred and thirty-four isolates were identified as Shigella species. S. flexneri, S. sonnei , S. boydii and S. dysenteriae were accounted respectively for 64.9%, 21.6%, 8.2% and 3.7% of the total number of Shigella isolated. Of these 56 (41.8%) were from children (0 to 14 years) and 78 (58.2%) were from adults and elderly patients. Over 70% of Shigella isolates were resistant to two or more drugs including Ampicillin and Co-trimoxazole. During 2002 to 2007, resistance to Ampicillin had increased from 46.7% to 68%. For Co-trimoxazole, though the resistance had gradually decreased from 100% to 72%, but still the resistance is high. Chloramphenicol resistance showed sudden decline from 73.3% to 25% from 2002 to 2003, but gradually has reached 48%. Nalidixic acid resistance was more than 70%. All isolates were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin during the period 2002 to 2004, but over the years the resistance pattern gradually increased up to 48%. Ceftriaxone had shown no resistance. The results of the study revealed the endemicity of Shigellosis with S. flexneri as the predominant serogroup. Children were at a higher risk of severe shigellosis. The results also suggest that Ampicillin, Co-trimoxazole, Chloramphenicol, Nalidixic acid and Ciprofloxacin should not be used empirically as the first line drugs in the treatment of Shigellosis. Periodic analysis and reporting of antibiotic susceptibility is an important measure to guide antibiotic treatment.","['Srinivasa H', 'Baijayanti M', 'Raksha Y']",2009,27,4,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Srinivasa H, et al.

19731368,Structure of the heme/hemoglobin outer membrane receptor ShuA from Shigella dysenteriae: heme binding by an induced fit mechanism.,"Shigella dysentriae and other Gram-negative human pathogens are able to use iron from heme bound to hemoglobin for growing. We solved at 2.6 A resolution the 3D structure of the TonB-dependent heme/hemoglobin outer membrane receptor ShuA from S. dysenteriae. ShuA binds to hemoglobin and transports heme across the outer membrane. The structure consists of a C-terminal domain that folds into a 22-stranded transmembrane beta-barrel, which is filled by the N-terminal plug domain. One distal histidine ligand of heme is located at the apex of the plug, exposed to the solvent. His86 is situated 9.86 A apart from His420, the second histidine involved in the heme binding. His420 is in the extracellular loop L7. The heme coordination by His86 and His420 involves conformational changes. The comparisons with the hemophore receptor HasR of Serratia marcescens bound to HasA-Heme suggest an extracellular induced fit mechanism for the heme binding. The loop L7 contains hydrophobic residues which could interact with the hydrophobic porphyring ring of heme. The energy required for the transport by ShuA is derived from the proton motive force after interactions between the periplasmic N-terminal TonB-box of ShuA and the inner membrane protein, TonB. In ShuA, the TonB-box is buried and cannot interact with TonB. The structural comparisons with HasR suggest its conformational change upon the heme binding for interacting with TonB. The signaling of the heme binding could involve a hydrogen bond network going from His86 to the TonB-box.","['Cobessi D', 'Meksem A', 'Brillet K']",2010,78,2,Proteins,"Cobessi D, et al.

Nalidixic acid has been one of the most common agents used for the treatment of shigellosis. Recently, some studies have reported an emerging resistance to this agent.
METHODS: In this study, we compared the resistance of Shigella isolates during the period 2001-2003 with the period 2004-2006.
RESULTS: Shigella spp. resistance was increased totally and in each subgroup, except for Shigella sonnei.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed an increasing resistance of the Shigella spp., thus identifying an emergent need for an alternative agent for the treatment of shigellosis in future.","['Mamishi S', 'Mashoori N', 'Mahboobi N', 'Pour Akbari B']",2009,50,8,Singapore Med J,"Mamishi S, et al.

19684159,Protective role of mouse MBL-C on intestinal mucosa during Shigella flexneri invasion.,"Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a C-type serum lectin, which is believed to play an important role in the innate immunity against a variety of pathogens. MBL can bind to sugar determinants of a wide variety of microorganisms, neutralize them and inhibit infection by complement activation through the lectin pathway and opsonization by collectin receptors. Given that small intestine is a predominant site of extrahepatic expression of MBL, here we addressed the question whether MBL is involved in mucosal innate immunity. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) genes of mouse MBL-C (mMBL-C) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant mMBL-C-CRD binds to Shigella flexneri 2a in a calcium-dependent manner and that interaction could be blocked by the anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody. mMBL-C-CRD protein could inhibit the adhesion of S. flexneri 2a to intestinal mucosa, while administration of anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody caused an increased level of bacteria adhesion in vitro. Administration of recombinant mMBL-C-CRD protein reduced the secretion of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 from primary intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with S. flexneri 2a. Furthermore, neutralization of MBL activity by anti-MBL-C-CRD resulted in a significant increase in the number of S. flexneri 2a that colonized the intestines of BALB/c mice and attenuated the severity of inflammation seen in the areas of bacterial invasion. These findings suggest that mMBL-C may protect host intestinal mucosa by directly binding to the bacteria.","['Zuo DM', 'Zhang LY', 'Lu X', 'Liu Y', 'Chen ZL']",2009,21,10,Int Immunol,"Zuo DM, et al.

19683069,Comparing early outbreak detection algorithms based on their optimized parameter values.,"BACKGROUND: Many researchers have evaluated the performance of outbreak detection algorithms with recommended parameter values. However, the influence of parameter values on algorithm performance is often ignored.
METHODS: Based on reported case counts of bacillary dysentery from 2005 to 2007 in Beijing, semi-synthetic datasets containing outbreak signals were simulated to evaluate the performance of five outbreak detection algorithms. Parameters' values were optimized prior to the evaluation.
RESULTS: Differences in performances were observed as parameter values changed. Of the five algorithms, space-time permutation scan statistics had a specificity of 99.9% and a detection time of less than half a day. The exponential weighted moving average exhibited the shortest detection time of 0.1 day, while the modified C1, C2 and C3 exhibited a detection time of close to one day.
CONCLUSION: The performance of these algorithms has a correlation to their parameter values, which may affect the performance evaluation.","['Wang X', 'Zeng D', 'Seale H', 'Li S', 'Cheng H', 'Luan R', 'He X', 'Pang X', 'Dou X', 'Wang Q']",2010,43,1,J Biomed Inform,"Wang X, et al.

19664950,"Diarrhea in children less than two years of age with known HIV status in Kisumu, Kenya.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the frequency and etiology of diarrhea in children aged less than 2 years with known HIV status.
METHODS: This was a nested cohort study, whereby children were followed during monthly routine and unscheduled visits. The HIV status of children was determined with PCR. A stool culture was obtained from children with diarrhea. A subset of stool samples was examined for parasites and tested for rotavirus.
RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2001, 682 children (51.0% male) contributed observation periods with a mean of 47 weeks. Overall there were 198 episodes of diarrhea per 100 child-years of observation (CYO); diarrhea was more common among HIV-positive children than among HIV-negative children (321 vs. 183 episodes/100 CYO, respectively, p<0.01) and was not statistically different for HIV-negative children born to HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative mothers (182 vs. 187 episodes/100 CYO, respectively, p=0.36). For 66.5% of the acute episodes a stool culture was obtained; 27.8% of stool cultures yielded a bacterial pathogen. A positive stool culture was less likely among HIV-positive children compared to children of HIV-negative mothers (20.5% vs. 34.3%, p=0.01). Susceptibility of Salmonella and Shigella to commonly used antibiotics was low. Rotavirus was detected in 13.9% of 202 examined stool samples, and a stool parasite in 3.8% of 394 samples. Diarrhea was associated with 37.8% of child deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea was more common among HIV-infected children, but was not associated with specific bacterial pathogens.

Nerve morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Immunoreactivity of nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in tissues were studied by immunohistochemistry. Ultrastructural analysis of intestinal biopsy revealed persisting axons degeneration throughout the study period in all patients. Regeneration was already evident at the acute stage with marked increase at late convalescence. Both acute shigellosis and cholera were accompanied by increased expression of NGF and histamine and decreased expression of serotonin that was restored at convalescence. Immunoreactivity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was increased during acute cholera, whereas in shigellosis VIP- and substance P-immunoreactive nerves appeared at early convalescence. Both shigellosis and cholera induced long-lasting degeneration of enteric neuronal axons, despite the presence of ongoing proliferation and regeneration processes.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The World Health Organization National Salmonella and Shigella Center Thailand, had confirmed the species and performed serotype identification of 1,913 clinical isolates of Shigella collected from the laboratory network of Department of Medical Sciences and the collaborated hospitals across Thailand from 2001 to 2005.
RESULTS: Between the year 2001 and 2005, 728, 481, 160, 247, 297 clinical isolates were tested, respectively. There were 5 isolates of S. dysenteriae (group A), 416 isolates of S. flexneri (group B), 4 isolates of S. boydii (group C) and 1,488 isolates of S. sonnei (group D). A total of 21 Shigella serotypes were identified and there were 3 serotypes in group A, 11 serotypes in group B, 4 serotypes in group C, and 3 serotypes in group D. Throughout these five years, the five common serotypes were S. sonnei Phases I and II, 28.6% (548 isolates); S. sonnei Phase I, 24.6% (470 isolates); S. sonnei Phase II, 24.6% (470 isolates); S. flexneri Type 2a, 10.9% (208 isolates), and S. flexneri Type 3a, 6.3% (121 isolates), respectively.
CONCLUSION: At the national scale in Thailand from 2001 to 2005, S. sonnei was the most frequent Shigella spp. isolated from patients in Thailand. In addition, S. dysenteriae and S. boydii were extremely uncommon.

19643213,Vaccination of children in low-resource countries against Shigella is unlikely to present an undue risk of reactive arthritis.,"Shigellosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in low-resource countries. Promising vaccine strategies in development include genetically attenuated Shigella, killed whole cell vaccines, subcellular vaccines, and O-polysaccharide-protein conjugates. There is a concern that Shigella vaccines could either induce reactive arthritis or could prime vaccinees for arthritis after a subsequent exposure to the pathogen because shigellosis is associated with reactive arthritis, especially in patients expressing the HLA B27 histocompatibility antigen. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis is incomplete, and even surrogate biomarkers of bacterial arthritogenic activity have not yet been identified. Nonetheless, all of the Shigella vaccine strategies currently in development are designed to limit inflammation and intracellular antigen persistence that could trigger arthritogenic sequelae. The relatively low occurrence of the HLA B27 phenotype in most Shigella endemic areas, and the rarity of reported reactive arthritis in these populations, suggests that vaccination with attenuated, killed, or subcellular vaccines may not increase the background incidence of arthritic sequelae. More importantly, incidence rates of shigellosis in children living in low-resource countries suggest that, during maturation, the entire pediatric population may be infected with Shigella-possibly with devastating consequences. Therefore, clinical trials of candidate Shigella vaccines should be pursued aggressively in the developing world, beginning with a Phase 1 in HLA B27-negative volunteers, but proceeding to Phase 2 and Phase 3 in unscreened volunteers. Post-vaccination monitoring for possible reactive arthritis should be included in all clinical protocols.","['Gaston JS', 'Inman RD', 'Ryan ET', 'Venkatesan MM', 'Barry EM', 'Hale TL', 'Bourgeois AL', 'Walker RI']",2009,27,40,Vaccine,"Gaston JS, et al.

Surveillance data from the Ministry of Health were used to calculate incidence rates in 1998-2006, both in the city of Bene Beraq and the Tel Aviv district. Information on isolates was collected from the bacteriological laboratory of a community hospital. Public notices and educational conferences conveyed a message to increase personal hygiene and keep ill children at home. During a 9-year period, a clear biennial pattern of outbreaks was noticed. Annual incidence rates ranged between 18 and 353/100,000 population. Shigellosis outbreaks tended to occur in the winter and were attributed to clonally related Shigella sonnei strains. Outbreaks in Bene Beraq preceded those in the other cities of Tel Aviv district, suggesting propagation of disease. In this population with highly endemic as well as superimposed outbreaks of shigellosis, short-term interventions had no lasting effect on prevention; future studies should focus on community-based programmes to avoid anticipated outbreaks.","['Calderon-Margalit R', 'Navon-Venezia S', 'Gefen D', 'Amitai Z', 'Barda R', 'Vulikh I', 'Sompolinsky D']",2010,138,2,Epidemiol Infect,"Calderon-Margalit R, et al.

19589900,Characterization of Shigella sonnei isolates from travel-associated cases in Japan.,"Shigella sonnei infection in industrialized countries is often associated with foreign travel. A total of 195 S. sonnei isolates in Japan, isolated from cases associated with foreign travel, were analysed by biotyping and molecular typing using PFGE and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA); their antimicrobial susceptibilities were also evaluated. The isolates were from 26 countries, most of which were Asian. Molecular typing revealed a correlation among the genotypes, biotypes and their geographical areas of origin. The isolates were classified into two biotypes, a and g. Biotype g isolates (n=178) were further divided into distinct clusters mainly on the basis of their geographical areas of origin by both PFGE and MLVA. Isolates from South Asian countries constituted one of the distinct clusters. Biotype g isolates from countries other than South Asia constituted other distinct clusters. Most of the isolates from other countries and continents, excluding the South Asian countries, were included in one major cluster by PFGE analysis. However, by MLVA, they were further divided into minor subclusters mainly on the basis of their countries of origin. MLVA was also demonstrated to be useful in molecular epidemiological analysis, even when only seven loci were applied, resulting in a high resolution with Simpson's index of diversity (D) of 0.993. A core drug-resistance pattern of streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed in 108 isolates, irrespective of their geographical areas of origin, but the frequency of resistance to nalidixic acid was high among the South Asian and East Asian isolates. Two isolates from China and India were resistant to cefotaxime and harboured the bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-15) genes, respectively; these isolates were also resistant to nalidixic acid, which is a matter of concern in terms of shigellosis treatment. Use of a combination of methods was found to be effective for epidemiological investigation in the case of S. sonnei infection.","['Izumiya H', 'Tada Y', 'Ito K', 'Morita-Ishihara T', 'Ohnishi M', 'Terajima J', 'Watanabe H']",2009,58,Pt 11,J Med Microbiol,"Izumiya H, et al.

24031415,Molecular epidemiology of Shigella spp strains isolated in two different metropolitam areas of southeast Brazil.,"Shigella spp., the human pathogen responsible for shigellosis, is highly infectious even at low levels. The incidence rate of shigellosis varies with geographical distribution, location human development index, and age groups, being higher among children aged under 5 years. In Brazil, a few works indicate that shigellosis cases are underestimated, with S. flexneri and S. sonnei strains being the major agents responsible for the shigellosis cases. The present study used pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to investigate the molecular epidemiology of 119 strains of S. sonnei and S. flexneri isolated from shigellosis cases that occurred in the metropolitan areas of Ribeirão Preto and Campinas Cities, São Paulo Sate, southeast Brazil. The results indicated (i) the existence of just a few strain clusters for both species, but with genotype variability with either a high speed of genetic change or constant introduction of several genotypes, considering the intense migration to these two metropolitan areas, and (ii) the prevalence of specific genotypes in each geographical area, which suggests the successful adaptation of some genotypes to the local environmental conditions. Our results indicate the need of more efficacious sanitary barriers to prevent Shigella spp. outbreaks and epidemics.","['Angelini M', 'Stehling EG', 'Moretti ML', 'da Silveira WD']",2009,40,3,Braz J Microbiol,"Angelini M, et al.

METHODS: The data of age, occupation, symptoms, signs, pathogen detection of 652 patients with acute bacterial dysentery diagnosed clinically from April 2007 to October 2007 were analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: The occupations of the 652 patients included office workers and functionaries (31.4%), students (29.4%), retirees (9.8%), unemployed and housewives (7.1%), commercial attendants (6.3), workers (4.8%), teachers (4.1%), and others (7.1%). Diarrhea, stomach ache, and fever were the main symptoms. Tenesmus and tenderness of left lower quadrant abdomen were infrequent. The positive rate of fecal bacterial culture was 17.7%. 8.9% of the patients were diagnosed as with bacterial dysentery by fecal bacterial culture.
CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with bacterial dysentery in Beijing are young adults. The positive rate of fecal bacterial culture is low.

Using well controlled and high-yielding covalent bioconjugation reactions, the two structurally independent epitopes were coupled to the lipopeptide Pam(3)CAG, i.e. a TLR2 ligand known for its adjuvant properties, anchored in preformed vesicles. The synthetic construct containing a pentadecasaccharide corresponding to three O-antigen repeating units triggered T-dependent anti-oligosaccharide and anti-S. flexneri 2a LPS antibody responses when administered i.m. to BALB/c mice. Moreover, the long-lasting anti-LPS antibody response afforded protection against a S. flexneri 2a challenge.

The present study explores the hypothesis that lactobacilli protect the host cell during S. dysenteriae Type 1 infection and its mechanism of action.
METHODS: Caco-2 cells incubated for 1h with Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Lactobacillus acidophilus at the multiplicity of infection of 100, either alone or in combination followed by addition of Shigella at the same multiplicity of infection for 5h served as treatment groups. Cells incubated with Shigella without lactobacilli addition served as infected cells. At the end of experimental period, cells were processed suitably to enumerate adherent and internalized Shigella. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess mRNA expression of interleukin-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Immunoblot for heat shock protein-70 and cytotoxicity assay were performed.
RESULTS: Pretreatment with the combination of lactobacilli significantly (p<0.05) prevented adherence and internalization of Shigella coupled with reduced expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 in host cells.
CONCLUSION: L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, synergistically offered better protection during S. dysenteriae Type 1 infection by efficiently inhibiting adherence and internalization of Shigella coupled with inhibition of pro-inflammatory response.","['Moorthy G', 'Murali MR', 'Niranjali Devaraj S']",2010,42,1,Dig Liver Dis,"Moorthy G, et al.

19460819,Metabolic control through ornithine and uracil of epithelial cell invasion by Shigella flexneri.,"This paper shows that compounds in defined growth media strongly influence the expression of the effectors of virulence in the human invasive pathogen Shigella flexneri. Ornithine in conjunction with uracil reduces the haemolytic ability of wild-type cultures more than 20-fold and the expression of the type III secretion system more than 8-fold, as monitored by an mxiC : : lacZ transcriptional reporter. mxiC gene expression is further decreased by the presence of methionine or branched-chain amino acids (15-fold or 25-fold at least, respectively). Lysine and a few other aminated metabolites (cadaverine, homoserine and diaminopimelate) counteract the ornithine-mediated inhibition of haemolytic activity and of the expression of a transcriptional activator virF reporter. The complete abolition of invasion of HeLa cells by wild-type bacteria by ornithine, uracil, methionine or branched-chain amino acids establishes that these metabolites are powerful effectors of virulence. These findings provide a direct connection between metabolism and virulence in S. flexneri. The inhibitory potential exhibited by the nutritional environment is stronger than temperature, the classical environmental effector of virulence. The implications and practical application of this finding in prophylaxis and treatment of shigellosis are discussed.","['Durand JMB', 'Björk GR']",2009,155,Pt 8,Microbiology (Reading),Durand JMB and Björk GR.

This study estimates the burden of disease in Jordan for Salmonella, Shigella, and Brucella during 1 year.
METHODS: Nationwide population and laboratory surveys were conducted during September 2003 and May 2004, and burden of disease estimates were calculated. A validation study was conducted prospectively from August to September 2003 to provide an estimate of the internal validity of burden estimates.
RESULTS: Each year in Jordan there are about 4.4 million episodes of diarrhea among persons >1 year of age and about 1.3 million persons seek medical care for diarrhea. For each person with laboratory-confirmed Shigella or Salmonella infection there are about 273 infected persons in the community. There are approximately 1.1 million episodes of fever and 0.7 million persons >1 year of age seeking medical care for fever each year. For each person with serological confirmed Brucella infection there are about 31 infected persons in the community. There are at least 16,260 Shigella, 6612 Salmonella, and 6912 Brucella cases yearly.

19379711,Activating mutations of N-WASP alter Shigella pathogenesis.,"The pathogenesis of Shigella requires binding to the host protein N-WASP. To examine the roles of structural conformation and phospho-regulation of N-WASP during Shigella pathogenesis, mutant N-WASP constructs predicted to result in a constitutively open conformation (L229P and L232P) or either a phospho-mimicking (Y253E) or phospho-disruptive (Y253F) structure were constructed. Pyrene actin assays demonstrated that the N-WASP L229P and L232P constructs are constitutively active. Despite the increase in actin polymerization seen in vitro, cell lines expressing N-WASP L229P and L232P supported shorter actin tails when infected with Shigella. Shigella actin tails were unchanged in cells expressing N-WASP phospho-regulation mutant proteins. Shigella invasion, intracellular, and intercellular motility were not altered in cells expressing N-WASP L229P or L232P. However, plaque numbers were increased in cells expressing N-WASP L229P and L232P. These data demonstrate that N-WASP structural conformation is an important regulator of Shigella pathogenesis in distinct segments of its lifecycle.","['Adamovich DA', 'Nakamura F', 'Worth A', 'Burns S', 'Thrasher AJ', 'Hartwig JH', 'Snapper SB']",2009,384,3,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Adamovich DA, et al.

In one study, the Shigella sonnei O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP)-protein conjugate showed 72% protection against disease in Israeli army recruits exposed to high rates (8-14%) of infection. The protection was related to vaccine-induced IgG anti-O-SP levels. Synthetic oligosaccharides of Shigella dysenteriae type 1, bound by their reducing ends to a carrier protein (""sun""-type configuration), induced significantly higher antibody levels than the native O-SP bound to protein by multiple-point attachments (""lattice""-type configuration). Attempts to synthesize the S. sonnei O-SP based oligosaccharides were not successful. Here, we describe the isolation, characterization, and conjugation of low-molecular-mass O-SP-core (O-SPC) fragments. The O-SPC fragments were bound by their reducing ends similar to the preparation of the synthetic S. dysenteriae type 1 conjugates. The O-SPC conjugates used oxime linkages between the terminal Kdo residues at the reducing ends of the S. sonnei saccharides and aminooxy linkers bound to BSA or a recombinant diphtheria toxin. The coupling reaction was carried out at a neutral pH and room temperature. IgG antibody levels induced in young outbred mice by the S. sonnei O-SPC conjugates were significantly higher then those elicited by the O-SP conjugates. Accordingly, we propose to evaluate clinically these conjugates.","['Robbins JB', 'Kubler-Kielb J', 'Vinogradov E', 'Mocca C', 'Pozsgay V', 'Shiloach J', 'Schneerson R']",2009,106,19,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Robbins JB, et al.

19332670,Antimicrobial susceptibility and mechanisms of resistance in Shigella and Salmonella isolates from children under five years of age with diarrhea in rural Mozambique.,"The antimicrobial susceptibility and mechanisms of resistance of 109 Shigella and 40 Salmonella isolates from children with diarrhea in southern Mozambique were assessed. The susceptibility to seven antimicrobial agents was tested by disk diffusion, and mechanisms of resistance were searched by PCR or colorimetric method. A high proportion of Shigella isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol (Chl) (52%), ampicillin (Amp) (56%), tetracycline (Tet) (66%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Sxt) (84%). Sixty-five percent of the isolates were multidrug resistant. Shigella flexneri isolates were more resistant than those of Shigella sonnei to Amp (66% versus 0.0%, P < 0.001) and Chl (61% versus 0.0%, P < 0.001), whereas S. sonnei isolates presented higher resistance to Tet than S. flexneri isolates (93% versus 64%, P = 0.02). Resistance among Salmonella isolates was as follows: Tet and Chl, 15% each; Sxt, 18%; and Amp, 25%. Only 3% of Salmonella isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal), and none to ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone (Cro). Among Salmonella isolates, multiresistance was found in 23%. Among Shigella isolates, antibiotic resistance was related mainly to the presence of oxa-1-like beta-lactamases for Amp, dfrA1 genes for Sxt, tetB genes for Tet, and Chl acetyltransferase (CAT) activity for Chl. Among Salmonella isolates, resistance was conferred by tem-like beta-lactamases for Amp, floR genes and CAT activity for Chl, tetA genes for Tet, and dfrA1 genes for Sxt. Our data show that Shigella isolates are resistant mostly to the most available, inexpensive antibiotics by various molecular mechanisms but remain susceptible to ciprofloxacin, Cro, and Nal, which is the first line for empirical treatment of shigellosis in the country.","['Mandomando I', 'Jaintilal D', 'Pons MJ', 'Vallès X', 'Espasa M', 'Mensa L', 'Sigaúque B', 'Sanz S', 'Sacarlal J', 'Macete E', 'Abacassamo F', 'Alonso PL', 'Ruiz J']",2009,53,6,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Mandomando I, et al.

19331696,Timeliness of national notifiable diseases surveillance system in Korea: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: With the increase of international travels, infectious disease control is gaining a greater importance across regional borders. Adequate surveillance system function is crucial to prevent a global spread of infectious disease at the earliest stage. There have been limited reports on the characteristics of infectious disease surveillance in Asia. The authors studied the timeliness of the Korean National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System with regard to major notifiable diseases from 2001 to 2006.
METHODS: Six notifiable infectious diseases reported relatively frequently were included in this study. Five diseases were selected by the criteria of reported cases > 100 per year: typhoid fever, shigellosis, mumps, scrub typhus, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In addition, dengue fever was also included to represent an emerging disease, despite its low number of cases. The diseases were compared for the proportion notified within the recommended time limits, median time lags, and for the cumulative distribution of time lags at each surveillance step between symptom onset and date of notification to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
RESULTS: The proportion of cases reported in time was lower for disease groups with a recommended time limit of 1 day compared with 7 days (60%-70% vs. > 80%). The median time from disease onset to notification to KCDC ranged between 6 and 20 days. The median time from onset to registration at the local level ranged between 2 and 15 days. Distribution of time lags showed that main delays arose in the time from onset to diagnosis. There were variations in timeliness by disease categories and surveillance steps.
CONCLUSION: Time from disease onset to diagnosis generally contributed most to the delay in reporting. It is needed to promote public education and to improve clinical guidelines. Rapid reporting by doctors should be encouraged, and unification of recommended reporting time limit can be helpful. Our study also demonstrates the utility of the overall assessment of time-lag distributions for disease-specific strategies to improve surveillance.","['Yoo HS', 'Park O', 'Park HK', 'Lee EG', 'Jeong EK', 'Lee JK', 'Cho SI']",2009,9,,BMC Public Health,"Yoo HS, et al.

19321731,Surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility patterns among Shigella sonnei strains isolated in Belgium during the 18-year period 1990 to 2007.,"This study was conducted to determine the frequency and pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility of Shigella sonnei, the predominant species causing shigellosis in Belgium. Between 1990 and 2007, a total of 7,307 strains, mainly (98.2%) isolated from stools, were diagnosed by peripheral laboratories before being confirmed as Shigella strains by serotyping by the National Reference Center of Salmonella and Shigella. A significant increase in resistances to tetracycline, streptomycin, trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and cotrimoxazole (i.e., trimethoprim in combination with sulfonamides) was observed during this period. Since 1998, resistance to nalidixic acid also increased to reach a peak (12.8%) of resistant isolates in 2004. Concomitantly, multidrug resistance (MDR) in this species emerged in 2007, with 82% of total isolates being MDR. However, during this 18-year period, all isolates remained fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The work includes the molecular characterization of mechanisms of resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole and class 1 and class 2 integrons. S. sonnei acquired antimicrobial resistance to traditional antibiotics (ampicillin and tetracycline) by horizontal gene transfer, while the genetic stability of transposons was responsible for a high (89%) proportion of resistance to a commonly prescribed antibiotic (cotrimoxazole). Therefore, cotrimoxazole should no longer be considered appropriate as empirical therapy for treatment of shigellosis in Belgium when antibiotics are indicated. Rates of resistance to nalidixic acid should also be attentively monitored to detect any shift in fluoroquinolone resistance, because it represents the first line among antibiotics used in the treatment of shigellosis.","['Vrints M', 'Mairiaux E', 'Van Meervenne E', 'Collard JM', 'Bertrand S']",2009,47,5,J Clin Microbiol,"Vrints M, et al.

19319017,"Green banana reduces clinical severity of childhood shigellosis: a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mature green banana (GB) fruit is rich in amylase-resistant starch that stimulates colonic production of short-chain fatty acids (referred to as fatty acid) and is useful in treating diarrheal diseases. We studied therapeutic effects of GB in childhood shigellosis by determining colonic fatty acid production in a double-blind, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.
METHODS: Seventy-three children aged 6 to 60 months with severe bloody dysentery caused by Shigella infection were either given a rice-based diet (54 kcal/dL), with cooked GB (250 g/L) (n = 34) or without GB (n = 39) for 5 days; all given ciprofloxacin (15 mg/kg, q12 hours). Stool volume, frequency, excretion of blood/mucus, and relevant clinical and laboratory indices were determined.
RESULTS: On day 5 (post-treatment), 59% children in GB group had no mucus compared with 36% in controls, fecal blood was completely cleared from 96% in GB group compared with 60% without GB (P < 0.05). GB treatment significantly reduced (P < 0.01) numbers of stools/day compared with controls (70% vs. 50%, P < 0.05). GB-specific reductions of mean fecal volumes (mL/kg) ranged from 25% to 40%; (P < 0.05) during the 5-day observations. Clinical success rates were 85% in GB group compared with 67% in controls (P < 0.05). GB significantly (P < 0.01) reduced fecal myeloperoxidase activity and increased fecal fatty acid concentrations (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: GB diet improves clinical severity in childhood shigellosis and could be a simple and useful adjunct for dietary management of this illness.","['Rabbani GH', 'Ahmed S', 'Hossain I', 'Islam R', 'Marni F', 'Akhtar M', 'Majid N']",2009,28,5,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Rabbani GH, et al.

19297378,Characterization of fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella flexneri in Hangzhou area of China.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella and determine whether the qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes could contribute to sporadic shigellosis at the clinic in the Hangzhou area of China.
METHODS: A total of 202 strains of Shigella (79 Shigella sonnei and 123 Shigella flexneri ) isolated from sporadic cases of shigellosis from 1998 to 2007 were analysed for their antimicrobial susceptibility. The gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE, qnr and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes and the profiles and incompatibility of plasmids were characterized. Chromosomal DNA fingerprinting was determined by XbaI-based digestion and PFGE.
RESULTS: All strains of S. sonnei were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) while 15 out of 123 strains of S. flexneri were resistant. All of the 15 resistant strains displayed common mutations in the gyrA and parC genes and formed eight distinct groups with unique molecular characteristics. Notably, 10 isolates showed mutations at codon 87 of gyrA, and the other 5 were qnrS-positive. Two strains were positive for the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene. Importantly, this is the first report of qnrS- and aac(6')-Ib-cr-positive Shigella in China, the qnrS-positive S. flexneri serotypes 1a, 2a and 4c and the aac(6')-Ib-cr-positive S. flexneri serotypes 2a and 4c worldwide.
CONCLUSIONS: The common mutations at position 83 of gyrA and position 80 of parC were crucial for resistance to nalidixic acid in S. flexneri. The mutation at position 87 of gyrA or the presence of the qnrS gene is necessary for high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in Shigella isolates from China.","['Pu XY', 'Pan JC', 'Wang HQ', 'Zhang W', 'Huang ZC', 'Gu YM']",2009,63,5,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Pu XY, et al.

19289511,Genetics and virulence association of the Shigella flexneri sit iron transport system.,"The sit-encoded iron transport system is present within pathogenicity islands in all Shigella spp. and some pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. The islands contain numerous insertion elements and sequences with homology to bacteriophage genes. The Shigella flexneri sit genes can be lost as a result of deletion within the island. The formation of deletions was dependent upon RecA and occurred at relatively high frequency. This suggests that the sit region is inherently unstable, yet sit genes are maintained in all of the clinical isolates tested. Characterization of the sitABCD genes in S. flexneri indicates that they encode a ferrous iron transport system, although the genes are induced aerobically. The sit genes provide a competitive advantage to S. flexneri growing within epithelial cells, and a sitA mutant is outcompeted by the wild type in cultured epithelial cells. The Sit system is also required for virulence in a mouse lung model. The sitA mutant was able to infect the mice and induce a protective immune response but was avirulent compared to its wild-type parent strain.","['Fisher CR', 'Davies NM', 'Wyckoff EE', 'Feng Z', 'Oaks EV', 'Payne SM']",2009,77,5,Infect Immun,"Fisher CR, et al.

19280143,"A food-borne outbreak of Shigella sonnei gastroenteritis, Austria, 2008.","We report on the first foodborne outbreak of Shigella sonnei described in Austria. On July 14 2008, AGES was informed of a cluster of 22 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with S. sonnei restricted to public health district X in the province of Salzburg. All cases had attended a youth-group trip to a small village in the province of Tyrol from July 7 to July 9. An outbreak case among the trip participants was a person who (1) attended the trip and (2) fell ill with diarrhea in the period between July 8 and July 12. Among the 61 trip participants, 42 fitted the outbreak case definition, including 31 culture-confirmed cases. A household outbreak case was a person who (1) did not participate in the trip, (2) fell ill with diarrhea not before July 10 and (3) had household contact with an outbreak case between one and three days before onset of illness. Of the 11 household outbreak cases, 10 were tested by stool culture and four of these had a laboratory-confirmed S. sonnei infection. In addition, one of the two hostel staff tested positive for S. sonnei. All 36 isolates were biotype gl, lysotype 12, and were indistinguishable from each other by PFGE. A cohort study among the trip participants revealed a risk ratio of 2.71 for consumption of salad (on at least 1 of the 3 days of the trip) (95% CI: 1.38-5.32, P = 0.004). Among the 42cases, 34 could be explained by consumption of salad. The landlady of the hostel, who prepared the salad with bare hands, was a carrier and was assumed to be the source of contamination of the salad. Without proper epidemiological analytical investigation of this shigellosis outbreak, its association with food consumption would not have been identified.","['Kuo HW', 'Kasper S', 'Jelovcan S', 'Höger G', 'Lederer I', 'König C', 'Pridnig G', 'Luckner-Hornischer A', 'Allerberger F', 'Schmid D']",2009,121,3-4,Wien Klin Wochenschr,"Kuo HW, et al.

19274103,Characterisation of early mucosal and neuronal lesions following Shigella flexneri infection in human colon.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella, an enteroinvasive bacteria induces a major inflammatory response responsible for acute rectocolitis in humans. However, early effect of Shigella flexneri (S. flexneri) infection upon the human mucosa and its microenvironement, in particular the enteric nervous system, remains currently unknown. Therefore, in this study, we sought to characterize ex vivo the early events of shigellosis in a model of human colonic explants. In particular, we aimed at identifying factors produced by S. flexneri and responsible for the lesions of the barrier. We also aimed at determining the putative lesions of the enteric nervous system induced by S. flexneri.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We first showed that, following 3 h of infection, the invasive but not the non-invasive strain of S. flexneri induced significant desquamation of the intestinal epithelial barrier and a reduction of epithelial height. These changes were significantly reduced following infection with SepA deficient S. flexneri strains. Secondly, S. flexneri induced rapid neuronal morphological alterations suggestive of cell death in enteric submucosal neurones. These alterations were associated with a significant increase in the proportion of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) immunoreactive (IR) neurons but not in total VIP levels. The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocked neuronal morphological changes induced by S. flexneri, but not the increase in the proportion of VIP-IR.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This human explant model can be used to gain better insight into the early pathogenic events following S. flexneri infection and the mechanisms involved.","['Coron E', 'Flamant M', 'Aubert P', 'Wedel T', 'Pedron T', 'Letessier E', 'Galmiche JP', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Neunlist M']",2009,4,3,PLoS One,"Coron E, et al.

19262407,The clinical course of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome: a five-year follow-up study.,"OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder seen in general practice. Bacterial gastroenteritis has been known to be a risk factor for IBS. We investigated the clinical course, risk factors, and prognosis of postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS) 5 years after Shigella infection.
METHODS: We recruited 153 individuals and used a questionnaire to investigate their current bowel habits. We also looked for the presence of other functional bowel disorders (FBDs). The Shigella-exposed group consisted of hospital employees and medical students who experienced abdominal pain, diarrhea, or fever during the shigellosis outbreak and whose stool culture revealed Shigella sonnei. The control group consisted of age-matched and sex-matched subjects who corresponded fairly well with patients, considering that they were enrolled from the same hospital and were not infected.
RESULTS: Complete data were obtained from 119 individuals who were divided into the Shigella-exposed group (59) and the control group (60). In the Shigella-exposed group, 3 patients had IBS before infection (previous IBS) and 6 out of 13 cases of PI-IBS after 3 years showed persistent IBS after 5 years. Five out of 11 PI-IBS patients (45.5%, 2 excluded), 3 out of 6 previous IBS patients (50%) in the Shigella-exposed group, and 7 out of 11 previous IBS patients (63.6%) in the control group recovered after 5 years (P>0.05). Five cases in the Shigella-exposed group and 3 in the control group developed new cases of IBS after 5 years. The prevalence of PI-IBS after 5 years in the previous FBD groups was 63.6%, whereas the prevalence of PI-IBS without a history of FBDs was 36.4% (P<0.05). There were no significant differences among the other risk factors in each group.
CONCLUSIONS: About half of PI-IBS and previous IBS patients with or without infection recover over 5 years. Previous IBS and FBDs are risk factors of PI-IBS after 5 years. We suggest that our results support the understanding of the clinical course and prognosis of PI-IBS.","['Jung IS', 'Kim HS', 'Park H', 'Lee SI']",2009,43,6,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Jung IS, et al.

19225095,Utility of multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis as a molecular tool for phylogenetic analysis of Shigella sonnei.,"A panel of 916 isolates, including 703 closely related IST1 isolates, were characterized by inter-IS1 spacer typing (IST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) to evaluate the utility of MLVA as a molecular tool for the phylogenetic analysis of Shigella sonnei. The global phylogenetic patterns determined by IST, PFGE, and MLVA were concordant. MLVA was carried out using 26 VNTR loci with a range of degrees of variability. MLVA data for the 703 IST1 isolates revealed that diversification among the closely related isolates was attributed mainly to four highly variable loci. The phylogenetic pattern for the closely related isolates determined using MLVA profiles of 8 highly variable loci was in agreement with that determined using the 26-locus profiles. A clustering analysis using the profiles of 18 loci with limited variability established clear phylogenetic relationships among IST clonal groups. Accordingly, MLVA is a useful tool for the phylogenetic analysis of S. sonnei. Combined VNTR loci with higher variability are useful markers for resolving closely related isolates, whereas combined loci with lower variability are suitable for establishing clear phylogenetic relationships between strains or clones that have evolved over a longer timescale.","['Chiou CS', 'Watanabe H', 'Wang YW', 'Wang WL', 'Terajima J', 'Thong KL', 'Phung DC', 'Tung SK']",2009,47,4,J Clin Microbiol,"Chiou CS, et al.

We have developed a whole-cell colorimetric pyrophosphate hydrolysis assay based on cheap, stable, and locally available reagents. An innovative filtration-cum-inoculation step eliminates interfering stool solids and ensures sufficient bacterial growth and apyrase expression in 6 to 7 h at 37 degrees C. In a limited double-blind study of 57 clinical isolates of common enterobacteria, the test showed 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity for Shigella spp. and EIEC.

19201878,A synthetic carbohydrate-protein conjugate vaccine candidate against Shigella flexneri 2a infection.,"The protective Ag of Shigella, the Gram-negative enteroinvasive bacterium causing bacillary dysentery, or shigellosis, is its O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) domain of the LPS, the major bacterial surface component. As an alternative to the development of detoxified LPS-based conjugate vaccines, recent effort was put into the investigation of neoglycoproteins encompassing synthetic oligosaccharides mimicking the protective Ags of the O-SP. We previously reported that when coupled to tetanus toxoid via single point attachment, a synthetic pentadecasaccharide representing three biological repeating units of the O-SP of Shigella flexneri 2a (SF2a), one of the most common Shigella serotypes, elicits a better serum anti-LPS 2a Ab response in mice than shorter synthetic O-SP sequences. In this study, we show that the pentadecasaccharide-induced anti-LPS 2a Abs protect passively administered naive mice from Shigella infection. Therefore, this three repeating units sequence, which is recognized by anti-SF2a sera from infected patients, acts as a functional mimic of the native polysaccharide Ag. Analyses of parameters influencing immunogenicity revealed that an investigational SF2a vaccine displaying a pentadecasaccharide:tetanus toxoid molar loading of 14:1 triggers a high and sustained anti-LPS Ab response, without inducing anti-linker Ab, when administered four times at a dose corresponding to 1 mug of carbohydrate. In addition, the profile of the anti-LPS Ab response, dominated by IgG1 production (Th2-type response), mimics that observed in human upon natural SF2a infection. This synthetic carbohydrate-based conjugate may be a candidate for a SF2a vaccine.","['Phalipon A', 'Tanguy M', 'Grandjean C', 'Guerreiro C', 'Bélot F', 'Cohen D', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Mulard LA']",2009,182,4,J Immunol,"Phalipon A, et al.

19199329,Crystal structure analysis and in silico pKa calculations suggest strong pKa shifts of ligands as driving force for high-affinity binding to TGT.,"A novel ligand series is presented to inhibit tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a protein with a significant role in the pathogenicity mechanism of Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of Shigellosis. The enzyme exchanges guanine in the wobble position of tRNA(Asn,Asp,His,Tyr) against a modified base. To prevent the base-exchange reaction, several series of inhibitors have already been designed, synthesized, and tested. One aim of previous studies was to address a hydrophobic pocket with different side chains attached to the parent skeletons. Disappointingly, no significant increase in binding affinity could be observed that could be explained by the disruption of a conserved water cluster. The ligand series examined in this study are based on the known scaffold lin-benzoguanine. Different side chains were introduced leading to 2-amino-lin-benzoguanines, which address a different pocket of the protein and avoid disruption of the water cluster. With the introduction of an amino group in the 2-position, a dramatic increase in binding affinity can be experienced. To explain this significant gain in binding affinity, Poisson-Boltzmann calculations were performed to explore pK(a) changes of ligand functional groups upon protein binding, they can differ significantly on going from aqueous solution to protein environment. For all complexes, a permanent protonation of the newly designed ligands is suggested, leading to a charge-assisted hydrogen bond in the protein-ligand complex. This increased strength in hydrogen bonding takes beneficial effect on binding affinity of the ligands, resulting in low-nanomolar binders. Crystal structures and docking emphasize the importance of the newly created charge-assisted hydrogen bond. A detailed analysis of the crystal structures in complex with substituted 2-amino-lin-benzoguanines indicate pronounced disorder of the attached side chains addressing the ribose 33 binding pocket. Docking suggests multiple orientations of these side chains. Obviously, an entropic advantage of the residual mobility experienced by these ligands in the bound state is beneficial and reveals an overall improved protein binding.","['Ritschel T', 'Hoertner S', 'Heine A', 'Diederich F', 'Klebe G']",2009,10,4,Chembiochem,"Ritschel T, et al.

19192746,Molecular epidemiological characteristics of Shigella spp. isolated from river Narmada during 2005-2006.,"Shigellosis is an acute gastroenteritis caused by Shigella species. Forty isolates of Shigella spp. were obtained from the river Narmada during 2005-2006. Twenty-three isolates were identified as S. flexneri, 10 as S. sonnei, and seven as S. dysenteriae on the basis of biochemical tests and serotyping. All the isolates harbored at least one plasmid (range: 1-4) and exhibited 12 distinct plasmid profile patterns. Out of 40 isolates, 90% were found to be resistant against more than two antibiotics. All of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. It is noteworthy that all of the S. dysenteriae strains were resistant to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim, and that all of the S. flexneri and S. sonnei strains were resistant to cephotaxime, amikacin, and norfloxacin, which can be used for the treatment of shigellosis. Forty-two and a half percent of Shigella isolates were found to be Congo red positive. Since the Congo red binding test is cheap and simple, it can be used to determine the virulence properties of Shigella species. We could not find a specific correlation between serotype, antimicrobial resistance, and plasmid profile.","['Sharma A', 'Singh SK', 'Kori L']",2009,71,6,J Environ Health,"Sharma A, et al.

19165331,The IpaC carboxyterminal effector domain mediates Src-dependent actin polymerization during Shigella invasion of epithelial cells.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, invades epithelial cells by locally reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton. Shigella invasion requires actin polymerization dependent on the Src tyrosine kinase and a functional bacterial type III secretion (T3S) apparatus. Using dynamic as well as immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that the T3S translocon component IpaC allows the recruitment of the Src kinase required for actin polymerization at bacterial entry sites during the initial stages of Shigella entry. Src recruitment occurred at bacterial-cell contact sites independent of actin polymerization at the onset of the invasive process and was still observed in Shigella strains mutated for translocated T3S effectors of invasion. A Shigella strain with a polar mutation that expressed low levels of the translocator components IpaB and IpaC was fully proficient for Src recruitment and bacterial invasion. In contrast, a Shigella strain mutated in the IpaC carboxyterminal effector domain that was proficient for T3S effector translocation did not induce Src recruitment. Consistent with a direct role for IpaC in Src activation, cell incubation with the IpaC last 72 carboxyterminal residues fused to the Iota toxin Ia (IaC) component that translocates into the cell cytosol upon binding to the Ib component led to Src-dependent ruffle formation. Strikingly, IaC also induced actin structures resembling bacterial entry foci that were enriched in activated Src and were inhibited by the Src inhibitor PP2. These results indicate that the IpaC effector domain determines Src-dependent actin polymerization and ruffle formation during bacterial invasion.","['Mounier J', 'Popoff MR', 'Enninga J', 'Frame MC', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Van Nhieu GT']",2009,5,1,PLoS Pathog,"Mounier J, et al.

The T3SA activity is activated upon contact of bacteria with cells and controls expression of some effectors. Recent structural and functional studies suggest that two different sets of effectors are involved in inducing actin cytoskeleton reorganization to promote entry of bacteria into epithelial cells and in modulating cell signaling pathways to dampen innate immune responses induced upon infection, respectively.

Shigella sonnei is one of the most prevalent causative agent of infectious gastroenteritis in developing and developed countries and it is the most frequently reported Shigella serotype from Turkey in recent years. The aim of this study was to determine the types of S. sonnei strains isolated in different provinces of Turkey [in Marmara earthquake regions (Izmit, n=5; Adapazari, n=6; Yalova, n=2) in 1999 and in Ankara (n=17) in 1997, 2000 and 2001] according to their antimicrobial resistance and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. All isolates were found sensitive to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Twenty three (76.6%) of isolates were found resistant to streptomycin, 21 (70%) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 20 (66.6%) to tetracycline, 6 (20%) to ampicillin, 3 (10%) to ampicillin/sulbactam and 1 (3.3%) to chloramphenicol. Three (%10) isolates were detected as intermediate susceptible to tetracycline and cefoperazone, while four isolates (13.3%) were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. A total of nine different patterns were obtained according to antimicrobial resistance patterns. PFGE was performed by Xbal restriction enzyme. Isolates were grouped into A (n=24) and B (n=6) main PFGE types and into 13 closely or possibly related types. A total of 15 different PFGE patterns were identified among the isolates. It was determined that isolates from the same clone disseminated in Ankara during the years 2000-2001. Overall, different clones of S. sonnei strains were in dissemination in the provinces included. This study indicated that different S. sonnei clones were in circulation in Turkey and these results constitute the basic molecular preliminary data for the National Enteric Pathogens Laboratory Network in Turkey.","['Akçali A', 'Levent B', 'Akbaş E', 'Esen B']",2008,42,4,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Akçali A, et al.

This is the first study in Austria that has investigated a broad range of pathogens recovered from an unselected population of patients who had consulted general practitioners because of gastroenteritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2007, all patients who visited one of three local general practitioners for acute gastroenteritis were invited to provide stool specimens to be tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (mTSB enrichment [R-Biopharm] followed by toxin ELISA plus culture), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Yersinia, Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium difficile (toxin plus culture), rotavirus plus adenovirus (RIDA) Quick Rotavirus/Adenovirus Combi test), Giardia duodenalis plus Cryptosporidium parvum (RIDA) Quick Cryptosporidium/Giardia Combi test), astrovirus (ELISA), and norovirus (reverse-transcriptase PCR).
RESULTS: Stool specimens were provided by 306 patients (161 female) with acute diarrhea. The ages of the patients ranged from 1 to 89 years (mean 37, median 36). Pathogens were detected in 71 (23.2%) patients, with incidence peaks in February and June. Norovirus accounted for 36.0% of positive results, C. difficile for 18.7%, rotavirus for 17.3%, Campylobacter for 9.3%, Salmonella for 6.6%, adenovirus for 5.4%, G. duodenalis and C. parvum for 2.7% each, and Yersinia enterocolitica for 1.3%. No cases of shigellosis or infection with EHEC, EPEC, or astrovirus were diagnosed. Viruses accounted for 58.7% of the 75 positive results, bacteria for 36.0%, and parasites for 5.3%.
CONCLUSION: Our study underlines a dominant role of norovirus and toxigenic C. difficile as etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis among the patients of general practitioners.","['Huhulescu S', 'Kiss R', 'Brettlecker M', 'Cerny RJ', 'Hess C', 'Wewalka G', 'Allerberger F']",2009,37,2,Infection,"Huhulescu S, et al.

19136781,"Trends in antimicrobial resistance of fecal Shigella and Salmonella isolates in Tehran, Iran.","CONTEXT: The resistance of bacteria to commonly prescribed antibiotics is increasing both in developing as well as developed countries. Resistance has emerged even to newer, more potent antimicrobial agents. The present study was therefore undertaken to report resistance rates to antimicrobial agents in 2487 stool culture isolates in a tertiary care hospital between 1996 and 2000 and 2001 and 2005.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 1996 to 2005, 31776 fecal samples were collected from all patients having diarrhea aged> 1 month to 14 years old. Microbiology records were reviewed and information on each isolate regarding its antimicrobial susceptibility profile was collected and recorded.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, Version 11.5 software.
RESULTS: Of the positive fecal cultures, 1329 (53.43%) of the isolates were Shigella spp and 700 (28.14%) of the isolates were Salmonella spp. Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased among most of the pathogens between 2001 and 2005. An increase in the rate of resistance was observed in Shigella spp for kanamycin (from 11 to 37%) and ceftazidime (from 1 to 9.9%) and among Salmonella spp. for nalidixic acid (from 9.2 to 42.3%) and ceftazidime (from 3 to 23.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Routine surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities to all classes of clinically used agents is necessary to detect resistance trends in different parts of world, detecting the emergence of new resistance mechanisms that guide infection control measures and public health guidelines; such trends may help in identifying outbreaks of resistant organisms. Such a check seems to be the best way to find appropriate antibiotic regimens.","['Ashtiani MT', 'Monajemzadeh M', 'Kashi L']",2009,52,1,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,"Ashtiani MT, et al.

Antimicrobial resistance has complicated the empirical treatment. Knowledge of serotypes is crucial in vaccine development, as cross-protection between various serotypes is limited. Therefore we conducted a prospective study to determine the frequency of isolation of Shigella serotypes and antimicrobial resistance.
METHODS: Stool samples from 8155 individuals, collected through a surveillance study conducted in four slums of Karachi from January 2002 to March 2004, were cultured.
RESULTS: Shigella was isolated in 394 (4.8%) of 8155 patients presenting with diarrhea. Two hundred and forty-two (62%) isolates were Shigella flexneri, 72 (18%) were Shigella sonnei, 43 (11%) were Shigella boydii, and 37 (9%) were Shigella dysenteriae. Thirteen S. flexneri serotypes were identified, of which the most frequent were 2a (38), 6 (37), and 1b (25), followed by 2b (23). Only 22 (5.6%) Shigella isolates were found to be pan-susceptible. Large proportions of isolates were resistant to co-trimoxazole (89% S. flexneri, 81% S. dysenteriae, 80% S. sonnei, and 56% S. boydii) and ampicillin (87% S. flexneri, 68% S. dysenteriae, 35% S. boydii, and 4% S. sonnei).

Of 3583 cases with age information, 1315 (37%) cases were from children between 0 and 4 years and 684 (19%) from children between 5 and 8 years. Most infections were recorded during 1993-1994 (> 1500 per year), decreasing to < 200 in 2006. The relative species distribution also changed. During 1993-1994, Shigella flexneri accounted for 2241 (65%) of 3474 isolations. This proportion decreased to 64 (36%) of 176 infections in 2006. Most infections occurred during July and August, and fewest in December. S. flexneri clustered around Bangkok, and Shigella sonnei in southern Thailand. Most S. flexneri infections were caused by serotype 2a (1590 of 4035) followed by serotype var X (1249). For both serotypes, a pronounced decrease in the number of isolates occurred over time. A much smaller decrease was observed for serotype 3a isolates. Phase I S. sonnei was initially most common, but shifted gradually over phase I, II, to only phase II. No differences in spatial distribution were found. The three most common S. flexneri serotypes all clustered in, around, and west of Bangkok. Serotypes 2a and 3a also clustered in southern Thailand, whereas var X clustered north and northeast of Bangkok. In conclusion, looking at Shigella species, Thailand changed from being a developing country to a developed country between 1995 and 1996.

19074655,Molecular detection of all 34 distinct O-antigen forms of Shigella.,"Shigella is the cause of shigellosis or bacillary dysentery, the occurrence of which is estimated to be 165 million cases per year worldwide, resulting in 1.1 million deaths. Rapid and reliable assays for detecting and identifying Shigella in food, environmental and clinical samples are therefore necessary. Shigella species are traditionally identified by their O antigens. This study developed a DNA microarray targeting O-serotype-specific genes to detect all 34 distinct O-antigen forms of Shigella, including Shigella boydii types 1-18, Shigella dysenteriae types 1-13, Shigella flexneri types 1-5 and 6, and Shigella sonnei. A total of 282 strains were used to test the specificity of the microarray, including 186 Shigella and Escherichia coli representative strains, 86 Shigella clinical isolates and ten strains of other bacterial species that are commonly isolated from food or clinical stool specimens. The oligonucleotide probes were printed on the microarray in concentrations from 1 to 100 muM, and 10 muM proved to be the optimal probe concentration. The detection sensitivity for each serotype was 50 ng genomic DNA or 1 c.f.u. in 25 g milk powder sample following a 6 h enrichment in broth. The microarray is specific, sensitive and reproducible, and, to our knowledge, is the first report of a microarray for serotyping all O-antigen forms of Shigella.","['Li Y', 'Cao B', 'Liu B', 'Liu D', 'Gao Q', 'Peng X', 'Wu J', 'Bastin DA', 'Feng L', 'Wang L']",2009,58,Pt 1,J Med Microbiol,"Li Y, et al.

19069623,Predicting treatment cost for bacterial diarrhoea at a regional hospital in Thailand.,"The aim of this study was to estimate the treatment cost and formulate a cost-function for bacterial diarrhoea among patients in a Thai regional hospital. This study was an incidence-based cost-of-illness analysis from a hospital perspective, employing a micro-costing approach. It covered new episodes of both outpatients and inpatients who were diagnosed to have bacterial diarrhoea (ICD-10 code A00-A05) and who received treatment during 1 October 2000-31 July 2003. Retrospective data were collected from medical records of the hospital. The study covered 384 episodes, and the mean age of patients was 24 years. The average treatment costs (at 2002 prices; US$1 = approximately 40 Thai baht) were US$11.29, 76.78, and 44.72 per outpatient episode, inpatient episode, and outpatient/inpatient combined episode respectively. Furthermore, the positive significant predictor variables were: inpatient care, other Salmonella-associated infections, shigellosis, other bacterial intestinal infections, and the health insurance scheme. The fitted model was able to predict greater than 80% of the treatment cost. The estimation of simulated patients demonstrated a wide range of costs, from US$10 per episode to US$163 per episode. Overall, hospital administrators can apply these results in cost-containment interventions.","['Riewpaiboon A', 'Intraprakan K', 'Phoungkatesunthorn S']",2008,26,4,J Health Popul Nutr,"Riewpaiboon A, et al.

To evaluate the changes in frequency of serogroups, 302 Shigella species were isolated in 2003 from hospitalized children, aged less than 12 years, with acute diarrhoea in Tehran, Iran. The number of collected S. sonnei, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. dysenteriae isolates was 178 (58.9%), 110 (37.4%), 10 (3.3%), and 4 (1.3%) respectively. Most (94%) S. sonnei isolates were resistant to co-trimoxazole. They were, however, relatively or completely sensitive to 15 commonly-used antibiotics. The extracted plasmids showed 12 different profiles with two closely-related patterns constituting 70% of the total isolates. Ribotyping, using PvuII, HindIII or SalI restriction enzymes, generated a single pattern for all S. sonnei isolates.

19036564,Lactobacilli facilitate maintenance of intestinal membrane integrity during Shigella dysenteriae 1 infection in rats.,"OBJECTIVE: Lactobacilli are used in various dairy products and fermented foods for their potential health beneficial effects. Recently we reported the protective role of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus acidophilus during Shigella dysenteriae 1 infection. Nevertheless, investigations on the membrane-stabilizing effect of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus have not been done. Hence, the present study evaluated the effect of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus on the maintenance of intestinal membrane integrity during S. dysenteriae 1-induced diarrhea in rats.
METHODS: Rats were divided into eight groups (n = 6 in each group). Induced rats received single oral dose of S. dysenteriae (12 x 10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/mL). Treated rats received L. rhamnosus (1 x 10(7)cfu/mL) or L. acidophilus (1 x 10(7)cfu/mL) orally for 4 d, alone or in combination, followed by Shigella administration. At the end of the experimental period, animals were sacrificed and the assay of membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatases (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase, and total ATPase), immunoblot analysis of tight junctional proteins (claudin-1 and occludin), and transmission electron microscopic studies were performed.
RESULTS: Induced rats showed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the membrane-bound ATPases and reduced expression of tight junction proteins in the membrane, coupled with their increased expression in the cytosol, indicating membrane damage. Transmission electron microscopic studies correlated with biochemical parameters. Pretreatment with combination of L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus significantly prevented these changes.
CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. acidophilus synergistically offered better protection to the intestinal membrane when compared with individual treatments with these strains during S. dysenteriae 1 infection.","['Moorthy G', 'Murali MR', 'Devaraj SN']",2009,25,3,Nutrition,"Moorthy G, et al.

19035770,The AcrAB-TolC pump is involved in multidrug resistance in clinical Shigella flexneri isolates.,"The two multiple-antibiotic resistance (Mar) phenotypes (n = 8, respectively) and susceptible isolates (n = 4) of Shigella flexneri from China were characterized involving the efflux pump AcrAB-TolC. The accumulation of ciprofloxacin, acrAB-tolC PCR, and levels of mRNA with northern blots were performed in three groups. Sequencing of acrAB-tolC was performed in selected isolates. An efflux inhibition was performed with Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide. The accumulation of ciprofloxacin at steady state in susceptible isolates was significantly higher than that in the two Mar groups (p < 0.05). The level of accumulation in the Mar strains was increased upon the addition of the protonophore carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone. The expression level of acrA mRNA in the Mar isolates was significantly higher than that in the susceptible isolates (p < 0.05). Mar strain H26 had a single-nucleotide substitution in locus 322(G-->T) of acrA, and Mar 0008 in locus 171(C-->A). The susceptible strain N15 had a base deletion in locus 36 (C) of tolC gene. The role of the inhibitors of efflux pumps was significant in some isolates with the high expression of Mar pump genes. In conclusion, overexpression of acrA gene leads to Mar in clinical isolates of S. flexneri, and ciprofloxacin acquired susceptible to S. flexneri with Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide.","['Yang H', 'Duan G', 'Zhu J', 'Lv R', 'Xi Y', 'Zhang W', 'Fan Q', 'Zhang M']",2008,14,4,Microb Drug Resist,"Yang H, et al.

19019157,Spa32 interaction with the inner-membrane Spa40 component of the type III secretion system of Shigella flexneri is required for the control of the needle length by a molecular tape measure mechanism.,"The effectors of enterocyte invasion by Shigella are dependent on a type III secretion system that contains a needle whose length average does not exceed 50 nm. Previously, we reported that Spa32 is required for needle length control as well as to switch substrate specificity from MxiH to Ipa proteins secretion. To identify functional domains of Spa32, 11 truncated variants were constructed and analysed for their capacity (i) to control the needle's length; (ii) to secrete the Ipa proteins; and (iii) to invade HeLa cells. Deletion at either the N-terminus or C-terminus affect Spa32 function in all cases, but Spa32 variants lacking internal residues 37-94 or 130-159 retained full Spa32 function. Similarly, a Spa32 variant obtained by inserting of the YscP's ruler domain retained Spa32 function although it programmed slightly elongated needles. Using the GST pull-down assay, we show that residues 206-246 are required for Spa32 binding to the C-terminus of Spa40, an inner membrane protein required for Ipa proteins secretion. Our data clearly demonstrate that shortening Spa32 affects the length of the needle in a comparable manner to the spa32 mutant, indicating that the control of needle length does not require a molecular ruler mechanism.","['Botteaux A', 'Sani M', 'Kayath CA', 'Boekema EJ', 'Allaoui A']",2008,70,6,Mol Microbiol,"Botteaux A, et al.

18996990,Small-molecule type III secretion system inhibitors block assembly of the Shigella type III secreton.,"Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) are essential virulence devices for many gram-negative bacteria that are pathogenic for plants, animals, and humans. They serve to translocate virulence effector proteins directly into eukaryotic host cells. T3SSs are composed of a large cytoplasmic bulb and a transmembrane region into which a needle is embedded, protruding above the bacterial surface. The emerging antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens urges the development of novel strategies to fight bacterial infections. Therapeutics that rather than kill bacteria only attenuate their virulence may reduce the frequency or progress of resistance emergence. Recently, a group of salicylidene acylhydrazides were identified as inhibitors of T3SSs in Yersinia, Chlamydia, and Salmonella species. Here we show that these are also effective on the T3SS of Shigella flexneri, where they block all related forms of protein secretion so far known, as well as the epithelial cell invasion and induction of macrophage apoptosis usually demonstrated by this bacterium. Furthermore, we show the first evidence for the detrimental effect of these compounds on T3SS needle assembly, as demonstrated by increased numbers of T3S apparatuses without needles or with shorter needles. Therefore, the compounds generate a phenocopy of T3SS export apparatus mutants but with incomplete penetrance. We discuss why this would be sufficient to almost completely block the later secretion of effector proteins and how this begins to narrow the search for the molecular target of these compounds.","['Veenendaal AK', 'Sundin C', 'Blocker AJ']",2009,191,2,J Bacteriol,"Veenendaal AK, et al.

This paper attempts to review how the Japanese surveillance system deals with imported infectious diseases and reviews the trend of these diseases. The cases of acquired infection overseas were extracted from the surveillance data in 1999-2008. The incidence and rate of imported cases of a series of infectious diseases with more than one imported case were observed by the year of diagnosis and place of acquired infection. During the period 10,030 cases that could be considered to be imported infectious diseases were identified. Shigellosis ranked as the most common imported disease, followed by amebiasis, malaria, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, typhoid fever, dengue fever, hepatitis A, giardiasis, cholera, and paratyphoid fever. The annual trends of these diseases always fluctuated but not every change was investigated. The study reveals that the situation of imported infectious diseases can be identified in the current Japanese surveillance system with epidemiologic features of both temporal and geographic distribution of cases of imported infectious diseases. However, further timely investigation for unusual increase in infectious diseases is needed.","['Taniguchi K', 'Yoshida M', 'Sunagawa T', 'Tada Y', 'Okabe N']",2008,6,6,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Taniguchi K, et al.

METHODS: The epidemiological characteristics of bacillary dysentery in Jinan from 1951 to 2005 were analyzed. A total of 485,333 cases in the span of 50 years were recorded, while the population-based case distribution was less than the total cases due to the data incompleteness during the Cultural Revolution.
RESULTS: The incidence of bacillary dysentery in Jinan has been decreasing by years with average incidence rate of 283.10/100,000. The significant differences were observed among the incidence rates of various ages(chi2 = 14.99, P < 0.05). There were four epidemic peaks, and all the incidence rates were about 1000/100,000. Age of onset mainly concentrated in the 0-4 years old, 20-years old and 30-years old. In terms of occupational distribution, workers accounted for 30.31%, the living-scattered children accounted for 22.71%, and the farmers accounted for 17.90%. The incidence focus was from July to September, which accounted for 71.57%. The peak of incidence emerged in August. The highest incidence in urban was 550.94/100,000.
CONCLUSION: Through the efforts of several generations of health workers, the incidence of bacillary dysentery in Jinan has been basically brought under control. Further step should be taken for the control of bacterial dysentery in urban areas and the management of bacterial dysentery in rural areas.

However, the multi-collinearity among meteorological factors affects the accuracy of correlation with bacillary dysentery incidence.
METHODS: As a remedy, a modified method to combine ridge regression and hierarchical cluster analysis was proposed for investigating the effects of climate variations on bacillary dysentery incidence in northeast China.
RESULTS: All weather indicators, temperatures, precipitation, evaporation and relative humidity have shown positive correlation with the monthly incidence of bacillary dysentery, while air pressure had a negative correlation with the incidence. Ridge regression and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that during 1987-1996, relative humidity, temperatures and air pressure affected the transmission of the bacillary dysentery. During this period, all meteorological factors were divided into three categories. Relative humidity and precipitation belonged to one class, temperature indexes and evaporation belonged to another class, and air pressure was the third class.
CONCLUSION: Meteorological factors have affected the transmission of bacillary dysentery in northeast China. Bacillary dysentery prevention and control would benefit from by giving more consideration to local climate variations.","['Huang D', 'Guan P', 'Guo J', 'Wang P', 'Zhou B']",2008,8,,BMC Infect Dis,"Huang D, et al.

18806341,Bacillary dysentery and meteorological factors in northeastern China: a historical review based on classification and regression trees.,"The relationship between the incidence of bacillary dysentery and meteorological factors was investigated. Data on bacillary dysentery incidence in Shenyang from 1990 to 1996 were obtained from Liaoning Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and meteorological data such as atmospheric pressure, air temperature, precipitation, evaporation, wind speed, and the amount of solar radiation were obtained from Shenyang Meteorological Bureau. Kendall and Spearman correlations were used to analyze the relationship between bacillary dysentery and meteorological factors. The incidence of bacillary dysentery was treated as a response variable, and meteorological factors were treated as predictable variables. Software R 2.3.1 was used to execute the classification and regression trees (CART). The model improved the accuracy of the fitting results. The residual sum square error of the regression tree model was 53.9, while the residual sum square error of the multivariate linear regression model was 107.2. Among all the meteorological indexes, relative humidity, minimum temperature, and pressure one month prior were statistically influential factors in the multivariate regression tree model. CART may be a useful tool for dealing with heterogeneous data, as it can serve as a decision support tool and is notable for its simplicity and ease.","['Guan P', 'Huang D', 'Guo J', 'Wang P', 'Zhou B']",2008,61,5,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Guan P, et al.

METHODS: Virulence genes ipaH and ial were detected by PCR and PFGE was used to subtype the isolates. Patterns were compared, using the software BioNumerics.
RESULTS: Within the 54 isolates, all were ipaH positive with 48 as ial positive. Strains from the Chongzhou outbreak were clustered into 4 PFGE patterns, with the predominant pattern accounted for 72% of the analyzed strains. The pattern of strains isolated from the cold pork with sauce was identical to the predominant pattern. The strains from Dayi outbreak were clustered into 8 PFGE patterns and the predominant pattern accounted for 56% of the test strains.
CONCLUSION: Strains from the two outbreaks were quite different and the 'cold pork with sauce' seemed to be the major source of infection, causing the outbreak of diarrhea in Chongzhou. The sources of infection of the Dayi outbreak might be complicated whereas PFGE showed a discriminatory and reproducible laboratory tool in the epidemiologic investigation on outbreaks of diarrhea.","['Miao YF', 'Huang W', 'Huang JP', 'Li ZJ', 'Jin D', 'Cui ZG', 'Zhao AL', 'Liang N', 'Bai Y']",2008,29,3,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Miao YF, et al.

The present study was undertaken to characterize apparently sporadic Shigella boydii strains isolated from pediatric patients in Iran.
FINDINGS: Ten S. boydii strains isolated from pediatric cases of gastroenteritis and acute diarrhea in Tehran between December 2002 and November 2003 were submitted to serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid profile analysis, ribotyping and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Seven isolates were attributed to serotype 2, whereas the remaining three belonged to serotypes 14, 18, 19, respectively. Six drug resistance phenotypes (R1 to R6) were defined with R4 - streptomycin (STR), ampicillin (AMP), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) - being the most prevalent. Plasmid analysis resulted in seven different plasmid profiles with one to five DNA bands. All strains, but one, shared the same ribotype, but PFGE differentiated them in four groups.
CONCLUSION: Based upon ribotyping and PFGE results, endemic circulation of S. boydii in Tehran, Iran, could be attributed to a few clones. Resistance pattern and plasmid profile analysis proved to be very effective in discriminating apparently unrelated strains of S. boydii.","['Ranjbar R', 'Mammina C', 'Pourshafie MR', 'Soltan-Dallal MM']",2008,1,,BMC Res Notes,"Ranjbar R, et al.

18710884,Epidemiology of highly endemic multiply antibiotic-resistant shigellosis in children in the Peruvian Amazon.,"OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to estimate the impact of a Shigella vaccine in an area where shigellosis is endemic by characterizing the disease burden and antibiotic-resistance profiles of isolates and by determining the prevalence of Shigella flexneri serotypes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a 43-month-long prospective, community-based diarrheal disease surveillance in 442 children <72 months of age in the Peruvian Amazon between October 1, 2002, and April 15, 2006.
RESULTS: The incidence of diarrheal disease was 4.38 episodes per child-year. The incidence rate for shigellosis was 0.34 episodes per child-year in children <72 months of age and peaked in children between 12 and 23 months at 0.43 episodes per child-year. Maternal education at or beyond the primary grade level, piped water supply, weight-for-age z score, and improved water-storage practices were the most significant determinants of disease in this community with living conditions comparable to many rural areas in the developing world.
CONCLUSIONS: Children living in this region had a 20-fold higher rate of disease incidence detected by active surveillance as those recently estimated by passive detection. Most symptomatic disease was caused by S flexneri, although the diversity of serotypes will require a multivalent vaccine to have a significant impact on the burden of disease caused by shigellosis. Several other public health disease-control interventions targeted at water source and improved storage, nutritional interventions, and improved maternal education seem to have a greater impact than a univalent S flexneri 2a vaccine.","['Kosek M', 'Yori PP', 'Pan WK', 'Olortegui MP', 'Gilman RH', 'Perez J', 'Chavez CB', 'Sanchez GM', 'Burga R', 'Hall E']",2008,122,3,Pediatrics,"Kosek M, et al.

Shigella strains were isolated, ranging from 53 to 106 (average, 82.4) isolates/year (2001-2005), and almost 80% of the isolates were Shigella sonnei. The most frequent country of origin was India. Strains from the country of the most frequent origin were studied by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Resistance to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and nalidixic acid was observed at the highest frequency: in 23 of the 25 strains isolated in 2001, 5 of the 13 strains isolated in 2002, and 16 of the 19 strains isolated in 2005. Strains showing the most prevalent multidrug-resistance pattern were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The PFGE profiles showed that 27 of the 44 strains isolated in 2001, 2002, and 2005 were identical in PFGE pattern, as determined using two restriction enzymes.

18692974,[A short history of phage therapy].,"From 1920 to 1940, phage therapy was extensively used to treat various infectious diseases. In 1915, Félix d'Herelle followed cases of bacillary dysentery in the Institut Pasteur hospital. He observed ""clear spots"" on bacteria culture. In 1917, d'Herelle presented a note to the ""Académie des sciences de Paris"" entitled: ""on an invisible microbe, an antagonist of the dysentery bacillus"". D'Herelle named this microbial agent bactériophage. In 1919, there was an epidemic of ""fowl typhoid"" in France. For d'Herelle, it was an opportunity to study phage behavior. He suggested that it was necessary to be infected by the macrophage to obtain a cure. A patient improves because the phage is present in his intestines and expresses its activity against the bacteria and the cure is initiated. The cured patient spreads phages and the epidemic stops. The first administration of phages was given in 1921 at the Hôpital des Enfants-Malades (Paris). The young patients suffering from dysentery (Shiga) recovered rapidly. From then on, phage preparations were marketed around the world. In Paris, ""le laboratoire du bactériophage"" produced many phages directed against common infectious diseases. But in 1945, a new era appeared in Western countries with the golden age of antibiotics. Phage therapy was abandoned in the Western world, but maintained (it seems) on a large scale in Poland and the USSR where infections continued being successfully treated.","['Dublanchet A', 'Fruciano E']",2008,38,8,Med Mal Infect,Dublanchet A and Fruciano E.

18672087,Vaccination against shigellosis: is it the path that is difficult or is it the difficult that is the path?,"Following several decades of research, there is not yet a convincing vaccine against shigellosis. It is still difficult, in spite of the breadth of strategies (i.e. live attenuated oral, killed oral, subunit parenteral) to select an optimal option. Two approaches are clearly emerging: (i) live attenuated deletion mutants based on rational selection of genes that are key in the pathogenic process, and (ii) conjugated detoxified polysaccharide parenteral vaccines, or more recently conjugated synthetic carbohydrates. Some of these approaches have already undergone phase I and II clinical trials with promising results, but important issues have also emerged, particularly the discrepancy between colonization and immunogenic potential of live attenuated vaccine candidates depending upon the population concerned (i.e. non endemic vs. endemic areas). Efforts are needed to definitely establish the proof of concept of these approaches, and thus the need for clinical trials which should also soon explore the possibility to associate different serotypes, in response to serotype specific protection against shigellosis. More basic research is also required to improve what we can still consider as first-generation vaccines, and to explore possible new paradigms including the search for cross-protective antigens.","['Phalipon A', 'Mulard LA', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2008,10,9,Microbes Infect,"Phalipon A, et al.

Here we have analysed for the first time the DNase activity in the patients with diseases caused by several bacterial infections. Several rigid criteria have been applied to show that the DNase activity is an intrinsic property of IgGs from the sera of patients with bacterial diseases but not from healthy donors. The relative activity of IgGs has been shown to vary extensively between the diseases analysed and from patient to patient, but most of the preparations had detectable levels of the DNase activity. On average, the catalytic activities were significantly lower than in patients with autoimmune pathologies and increased in the following order: streptococcal infection (erysipelas) < urogenital chlamydiosis associated with arthritis (Reiter's disease) < meningococcal meningitis < shigellosis < suppurative surgical infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus < suppurative surgical infections caused by epidermal staphylococci < urogenital ureaplasmosis associated with reactive arthritis. While intact IgGs possessed this catalytic activity, separated light chains of polyclonal Abs appeared to be even more active in the hydrolysis of DNA.","['Parkhomenko TA', 'Odintsova ES', 'Buneva VN', 'Kunder EV', 'Zhyltsov IV', 'Senkovich SA', 'Generalov II', 'Nevinsky GA']",2009,13,9A,J Cell Mol Med,"Parkhomenko TA, et al.

18656530,The C-terminus of IpaC is required for effector activities related to Shigella invasion of host cells.,"Invasion plasmid antigen C (IpaC) is secreted by the Shigella flexneri type III secretion system (TTSS) as an essential trigger of epithelial cell invasion. At the molecular level, IpaC possesses a distinct functional organization. The IpaC C-terminal region between amino acids 319 and 345 is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure. Such alpha-helical motifs appear to be a recurring structural theme among TTSS components. Together with IpaB, this IpaC region is also required for the formation of translocon pores in target cell membranes. In contrast, mutations within the C-terminal tail of IpaC (defined by residues 345-363) have no effect on contact hemolysis (a putative measure of translocon pore formation), but they can contribute significantly to IpaC's ability to trigger S. flexneri entry into cultured cells. Here we describe the molecular dissection of the IpaC C-terminus and how changes in this region affect selected virulence-related activities. IpaC invasion function requires its immediate C-terminus and this general region may be involved in its ability to trigger actin nucleation. In contrast, IpaC could not be shown to interact directly with Cdc42, a host GTPase closely tied to Shigella invasion.","['Terry CM', 'Picking WL', 'Birket SE', 'Flentie K', 'Hoffman BM', 'Barker JR', 'Picking WD']",2008,45,4,Microb Pathog,"Terry CM, et al.

18648517,The interplay between Entamoeba and enteropathogenic bacteria modulates epithelial cell damage.,"BACKGROUND: Mixed intestinal infections with Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba dispar and bacteria with exacerbated manifestations of disease are common in regions where amoebiasis is endemic. However, amoeba-bacteria interactions remain largely unexamined.
METHODOLOGY: Trophozoites of E. histolytica and E. dispar were co-cultured with enteropathogenic bacteria strains Escherichia coli (EPEC), Shigella dysenteriae and a commensal Escherichia coli. Amoebae that phagocytosed bacteria were tested for a cytopathic effect on epithelial cell monolayers. Cysteine proteinase activity, adhesion and cell surface concentration of Gal/GalNAc lectin were analyzed in amoebae showing increased virulence. Structural and functional changes and induction of IL-8 expression were determined in epithelial cells before and after exposure to bacteria. Chemotaxis of amoebae and neutrophils to human IL-8 and conditioned culture media from epithelial cells exposed to bacteria was quantified.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: E. histolytica digested phagocytosed bacteria, although S. dysenteriae retained 70% viability after ingestion. Phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria augmented the cytopathic effect of E. histolytica and increased expression of Gal/GalNAc lectin on the amoebic surface and increased cysteine proteinase activity. E. dispar remained avirulent. Adhesion of amoebae and damage to cells exposed to bacteria were increased. Additional increases were observed if amoebae had phagocytosed bacteria. Co-culture of epithelial cells with enteropathogenic bacteria disrupted monolayer permeability and induced expression of IL-8. Media from these co-cultures and human recombinant IL-8 were similarly chemotactic for neutrophils and E. histolytica.
CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial monolayers exposed to enteropathogenic bacteria become more susceptible to E. histolytica damage. At the same time, phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria by amoebae further increased epithelial cell damage.
SIGNIFICANCE: The in vitro system presented here provides evidence that the Entamoeba/enteropathogenic bacteria interplay modulates epithelial cell responses to the pathogens. In mixed intestinal infections, where such interactions are possible, they could influence the outcome of disease. The results offer insights to continue research on this phenomenon.","['Galván-Moroyoqui JM', 'Del Carmen Domínguez-Robles M', 'Franco E', 'Meza I']",2008,2,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Galván-Moroyoqui JM, et al.

18621718,Structures of synthetic O-antigen fragments from serotype 2a Shigella flexneri in complex with a protective monoclonal antibody.,"The anti-LPS IgG mAb F22-4, raised against Shigella flexneri serotype 2a bacteria, protects against homologous, but not heterologous, challenge in an experimental animal model. We report the crystal structures of complexes formed between Fab F22-4 and two synthetic oligosaccharides, a decasaccharide and a pentadecasaccharide that were previously shown to be both immunogenic and antigenic mimics of the S. flexneri serotype 2a O-antigen. F22-4 binds to an epitope contained within two consecutive 2a serotype pentasaccharide repeat units (RU). Six sugar residues from a contiguous nine-residue segment make direct contacts with the antibody, including the nonreducing rhamnose and both branching glucosyl residues from the two RUs. The glucosyl residue, whose position of attachment to the tetrasaccharide backbone of the RU defines the serotype 2a O-antigen, is critical for recognition by F22-4. Although the complete decasaccharide is visible in the electron density maps, the last four pentadecasaccharide residues from the reducing end, which do not contact the antibody, could not be traced. Although considerable mobility in the free oligosaccharides can thus be expected, the conformational similarity between the individual RUs, both within and between the two complexes, suggests that short-range transient ordering to a helical conformation might occur in solution. Although the observed epitope includes the terminal nonreducing residue, binding to internal epitopes within the polysaccharide chain is not precluded. Our results have implications for vaccine development because they suggest that a minimum of two RUs of synthetic serotype 2a oligosaccharide is required for optimal mimicry of O-Ag epitopes.","['Vulliez-Le Normand B', 'Saul FA', 'Phalipon A', 'Bélot F', 'Guerreiro C', 'Mulard LA', 'Bentley GA']",2008,105,29,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Vulliez-Le Normand B, et al.

18603983,Shigella isolates of Nepal: changes in the incidence of shigella subgroups and trends of antimicrobial susceptibility pattern.,"OBJECTIVES: Shigellosis is an important cause of bloody diarrhoea in all age groups, especially in children. A retrospective study was done to analyse the pattern of shigella isolates and the antimicrobial susceptibility trend of these shigella isolated at different hospitals of Nepal from Jan, 2003- Dec, 2005.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 118 Shigella species isolated at nine different hospital laboratories of Nepal were reported to National Public Health Laboratory during January, 2003- December 2005 .The isolates were tested for the confirmation of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern by standard bacteriological techniques.
RESULTS: Of the 118 Shigella isolates reported, Shigella flexneri 51 (43.22%) was the predominant of the four species followed by Shigella dysenteriae 49(41.52 %) , Shigella boydii (7.62%) and Shigella sonnei (7.62%).But the yearly distribution of the Shigella isolates in 2003 and 2004 showed that Shigella dysenteriae was the most common of the four species. In 2005, a shift in the species was noted as Sh flexneri replaced Sh dysenteriae and became the most prevalent species. The percentage of Shigella dysenteriae type-1 among all Shigella dysenteriae were 66.66 % in 2003, 44.44 % in 2004 and 60 % in 2005. Individual or multiple resistances to Ampicillin, Nalidixic acid, and/or Cotrimoxazole was seen in all the four species of Shigella. 33% of the total Shigella isolates reported were multi drug resistant (showing resistance to 3 or more antibiotics at a time). Shigella dysenteriae type-1(Sd 1) isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin were also encountered in the present study .Of the total 25 Shigella dysenteriae type 1 isolates reported, 18(72%) were ciprofloxacin resistant . All the Shigella isolates were however sensitive to Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.
CONCLUSION: Distribution of different species of Shigella and their antibiotic susceptibility profile may vary from one geographical location to another and may also change with time. Systematic monitoring of the species and serotypes of Shigellae and their antimicrobial susceptibility can help to guide therapy and reveal periodic epidemics due to Sd 1, which may have acquired resistance to antibiotics that have previously been effective.

Fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and Shigella flexneri type 2a emerged in India during 2002 and 2003, respectively. Sixty strains of Shigella from different parts of India were analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility, the presence of the qnr plasmid, mutations in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs), fluoroquinolone accumulation, and the presence of other genes encoding resistance to various antimicrobials. Fluoroquinolone-resistant strains had mutations in gyrA and parC genes and had an active efflux system. They were also resistant to several other antimicrobials but were susceptible to azithromycin and ceftriaxone. The majority of the strains harboured genes encoding resistance to ampicillin (97 %), tetracycline (95 %), streptomycin (95 %) and chloramphenicol (94 %).

18564716,A food borne outbreak of gastroenteritis due to shigella and possibly salmonella in a school.,"On August 5, 2005, a private hospital reported a large number of students with gastrointestinal illness from the same school in Bangkok, Thailand. The Bureau of Epidemiology along with the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration investigated this outbreak, to determine risk factors, identify the source of infection and possible causative organism, and recommend prevention and control strategies. A case was defined as a person who was studying or working at School A and who developed abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting during the five-day period of August 4 to 8, 2005. A descriptive study was carried out for active case-finding, medical records review, and case interviews. We conducted the retrospective cohort study among third and fourth grade students. Stool samples were collected and tested at the Thai National Institute of Health and at private hospital laboratories. The overall attack rate was 37%. Main symptoms were diarrhea, fever, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea. The highest attack rate (63%) was among fourth-grade students. Based on food-history data collected from ill and well students, a multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a mixed chicken and rice dish served for lunch on August 4 was associated with illness (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.46-7.36). Among stools samples from 103 cases, Shigella group D was found in 18 cases, Salmonella group C in 5 cases, and Salmonella group E in 2 cases. This food borne outbreak of gastroenteritis was most likely caused by Shigella spp although the possibility of mixed contamination with Shigella and Salmonella spp cannot be ruled out.

18559201,[Shigella spp. infections in Getafe Hospital between 2001 and 2006].,"INTRODUCTION: Shigella spp. is a bacterium that frequently causes diarrhoea in underdeveloped countries, but not so much in Spain, where it has been published that its incidence has decreased in the last few years.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study has been to asses changes in the epidemiology of Shigella spp. infection over the last 5 years in children of Getafe, as well as the subspecies of Shigella spp. that cause illness in this area (area 10, Madrid), the need for hospitalisation, the complications and the treatment.
METHOD: A retrospective study was carried out, based on a review of the medical charts of children less than fifteen years old and had a diagnosis of Shigella spp. infection during 2000-2006. They were identified through the Getafe Hospital Microbiology Service.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients were identified, of which only four needed to be hospitalised. There were no differences between males and females. The Shigella spp. subspecies identified were S. sonnei and S. flexneri. The most frequent symptoms were vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and fever. Only one had dehydration as a complication. The treatment was symptomatic, except in the four hospitalised patients, who required fluid therapy and antibiotics. The outcome was good in all patients.
CONCLUSION: In this study, there appears to be an increase in the Shigella spp. incidence over the last few years in Area 10 of Madrid. Due to the fact that Shigella spp. is not a frequent bacterium in Spain, there are not enough studies on it, therefore it would be of interest to carry out prospective studies, in order to confirm this increase in incidence.","['Colmenero Hernández A', 'Vila Calvo A', 'Salcedo Lobato E', 'Fernández Jiménez F', 'Sánchez Concheiro M', 'Ramos Amador JT']",2008,68,6,An Pediatr (Barc),"Colmenero Hernández A, et al.

Adult medical rates decreased from 0.195/1000 in 1996-1998 to 0.087/1000 admissions in 2003-2006, and paediatric rates were 0.807/1000 and 0.809/1000 admissions, respectively. Twenty patients were children (median age 7 months) and 14 were adults (median age 41 years). The main clinical presentations were acute (<or=7 days) diarrhoea [94% children and 27% adults (P=0.035)], chronic diarrhoea (27% adults) and pyrexia but no diarrhoea (36% adults and one child). Seventy-five percent of children were tested for HIV infection and 30% were found to be HIV-seropositive. The 10 adults tested were all HIV-positive. All children survived while 50% of adults died (P=0.002). Shigella flexneri caused 88% of cases.

18510366,Structure-based drug design: exploring the proper filling of apolar pockets at enzyme active sites.,"The proper filling of apolar pockets at enzyme active sites is central for increasing binding activity and selectivity of hits and leads in medicinal chemistry. In our structure-based design approach toward the generation of potent enzyme inhibitors, we encountered a variety of challenges in gaining suitable binding affinity from the occupation of such pockets. We summarize them here for the first time. A fluorine scan of tricyclic thrombin inhibitors led to the discovery of favorable orthogonal dipolar C-F...CO interactions. Efficient cation-pi interactions were established in the S4 pocket of factor Xa, another serine protease from the blood coagulation cascade. Changing from mono- to bisubstrate inhibitors of catechol O-methyltransferase, a target in the L-Dopa-based treatment of Parkinson's disease, enabled the full exploitation of a previously unexplored hydrophobic pocket. Conformational preorganization of a pocket at an enzyme active site is crucial for harvesting binding affinity. This is demonstrated for two enzymes from the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, IspE and IspF, which are pursued as antimalarial targets. Disrupting crystallographically defined water networks on the way into a pocket might cost all of the binding free enthalpy gained from its occupation, as revealed in studies with tRNA-guanine transglycosylase, a target against shigellosis. Investigations of the active site of plasmepsin II, another antimalarial target, showed that principles for proper apolar cavity filling, originally developed for synthetic host-guest systems, are also applicable to enzyme environments.","['Zürcher M', 'Diederich F']",2008,73,12,J Org Chem,Zürcher M and Diederich F.

Because of increasing trends towards drug resistance, this study was undertaken to monitor local resistance patterns of Shigella isolates from 8 Asian countries.
METHODS: Ninety eight Shigella isolates collected from 8 centers in 8 Asian countries from July 2001 to July 2004 were analyzed in terms of serogroup distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility.
RESULTS: The most common serogroup of Shigella isolates was Shigella flexneri (49/98, 50%), followed by Shigella sonnei (44/98, 45%). The highest resistance rate was found for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (81%), followed by tetracycline (74%) and ampicillin (53%). Overall, 76 Shigella isolates (78%) were multidrug-resistant strains; S. flexneri had a higher multidrug resistance rate than S. sonnei (74% vs 23%). Increasing ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone resistance was observed; approximately 10% and 5% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, respectively. Five ceftriaxone-non-susceptible strains (from Taiwan [3], Hong Kong [1] and The Philippines [1]) and 10 ciprofloxacin-non-susceptible strains (from Hong Kong [2], The Philippines [1], Korea [2], Vietnam [4] and Sri Lanka [1]) were isolated.
CONCLUSIONS: High rates of multidrug resistance and steady increases in ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin resistance of Shigella are serious pubic health concerns in Asian countries. Continuous monitoring of resistance patterns among Shigella isolates is necessary.","['Kuo CY', 'Su LH', 'Perera J', 'Carlos C', 'Tan BH', 'Kumarasinghe G', 'So T', 'Van PH', 'Chongthaleong A', 'Song JH', 'Chiu CH']",2008,41,2,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Kuo CY, et al.

In poor countries, Shigella-caused dysentery is endemic and causes an estimated 163 million illness episodes annually and more than one million deaths. Although several strategies have been used to develop vaccines targeting shigellosis, none has been licensed for use outside China. Owing to the wide range of Shigella serotypes and subtypes, there is a need for a multivalent vaccine representing prevalent species and serotypes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Vaccine development has been limited by the lack of a suitable animal model for vaccine testing. This review discusses the most advanced strategies for Shigella vaccine development including live attenuated, conjugate, broad spectrum, and proteosome-based vaccines and describes current animal models under study.
SUMMARY: The greatest barrier to the use of vaccine against shigellosis in developing areas is poor immune responses to oral vaccines in children who have minimal maternal antibodies.

18426984,Virulent Shigella flexneri subverts the host innate immune response through manipulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression.,"Antimicrobial factors are efficient defense components of the innate immunity, playing a crucial role in the intestinal homeostasis and protection against pathogens. In this study, we report that upon infection of polarized human intestinal cells in vitro, virulent Shigella flexneri suppress transcription of several genes encoding antimicrobial cationic peptides, particularly the human beta-defensin hBD-3, which we show to be especially active against S. flexneri. This is an example of targeted survival strategy. We also identify the MxiE bacterial regulator, which controls a regulon encompassing a set of virulence plasmid-encoded effectors injected into host cells and regulating innate signaling, as being responsible for this dedicated regulatory process. In vivo, in a model of human intestinal xenotransplant, we confirm at the transcriptional and translational level, the presence of a dedicated MxiE-dependent system allowing S. flexneri to suppress expression of antimicrobial cationic peptides and promoting its deeper progression toward intestinal crypts. We demonstrate that this system is also able to down-regulate additional innate immunity genes, such as the chemokine CCL20 gene, leading to compromised recruitment of dendritic cells to the lamina propria of infected tissues. Thus, S. flexneri has developed a dedicated strategy to weaken the innate immunity to manage its survival and colonization ability in the intestine.","['Sperandio B', 'Regnault B', 'Guo J', 'Zhang Z', 'Stanley SL', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Pédron T']",2008,205,5,J Exp Med,"Sperandio B, et al.

Shigella strains are in effect Escherichia coli with a specific mode of pathogenicity, and 18 of the 34 O antigens are also found in traditional E. coli. Three are very similar to E. coli O antigens and 13 are unique to Shigella strains. The O antigen of Shigella sonnei is quite atypical for E. coli and is thought to have transferred from Plesiomonas. The other 12 O antigens unique to Shigella strains have structures that are typical of E. coli, but there are considerably more anomalies in their gene clusters, probably reflecting recent modification of the structures.

18387071,A cost function analysis of shigellosis in Thailand.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a cost function model to estimate the public treatment cost of shigellosis patients in Thailand.
METHODS: This study is an incidence-based cost-of-illness analysis from a provider's perspective. The sample cases in this study were shigellosis patients residing in Kaengkhoi District, Saraburi Province, Thailand. All diarrhea patients who came to the health-care centers in Kaengkhoi District, Kaengkhoi District Hospital and Saraburi Regional Hospital during the period covering May 2002 to April 2003 were tested for Shigella spp. The sample for our study included all patients with culture that confirmed the presence of shigellosis. Public treatment cost was defined as the costs incurred by the health-care service facilities arising from individual cases. The cost was calculated based on the number of services that were utilized (clinic visits, hospitalization, pharmaceuticals, and laboratory investigations), as well as the unit cost of the services (material, labor and capital costs). The data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Furthermore, the stepwise multiple regressions were employed to create a cost function, and the uncertainty was tested by a one-way sensitivity analysis of varying discount rate, cost category, and drug prices.
RESULTS: Cost estimates were based from 137 episodes of 130 patients. Ninety-four percent of them received treatment as outpatients. One-fifth of the episodes were children aged less than 5 years old. The average public treatment cost was US$8.65 per episode based on 2006 prices (95% CI, 4.79, and 12.51) (approximately US$1 = 38.084 Thai baht). The majority of the treatment cost (59.3%) was consumed by the hospitalized patients, though they only accounted for 5.8% of all episodes. The sensitivity analysis on the component of costs and drug prices showed a variation in the public treatment cost ranging from US$8.29 to US$9.38 (-4.20% and 8.43% of the base-case, respectively). The public treatment cost model has an adjusted R(2) of 0.788. The positive predictor variables were types of services (inpatient and outpatient), types of health-care facilities (health center, district hospital, regional hospital), and insurance schemes (civil servants medical benefit scheme, social security scheme and universal health coverage scheme). Treatment cost was estimated for various scenarios based on the fitted cost model.
CONCLUSION: The average public treatment cost of shigellosis in Thailand was estimated in this study. Service types, health-care facilities, and insurance schemes were the predictors used to predict nearly 80% of the cost. The estimated cost based on the fitted model can be employed for hospital management and health-care planning.","['Riewpaiboon A', 'Youngkong S', 'Sreshthaputra N', 'Stewart JF', 'Samosornsuk S', 'Chaicumpa W', 'von Seidlein L', 'Clemens JD']",2008,11 Suppl 1,,Value Health,"Riewpaiboon A, et al.

Little is known about their in vivo role in acute intestinal bacterial infections in humans. We undertook to evaluate these cells in rectal mucosal biopsies of patients with acute colitis.
METHODS: All mucosal mononuclear phagocytic cells in rectal biopsies of patients with acute Campylobacter colitis (n = 5), shigellosis (n = 5), and cholera (n = 10) were evaluated ultrastructurally and compared with those in controls (n = 5).
RESULTS: Mononuclear phagocytic cells in the superficial rectal mucosa showed a higher prevalence of ultrastructural features of activation in Campylobacter colitis and cholera than in controls. A lower prevalence of features of activation with increased monocytes was seen in shigellosis. Cells with the ultrastructural morphology of activated dendritic cells constituted 41% and 45% of all mononuclear phagocytic cells in two of five patients with Campylobacter colitis and 4-22% of cells in four of 10 patients with cholera. Their presence in patients with Campylobacter colitis was associated with significant surface epithelial damage and prominent acute inflammatory changes in the mucosa.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first ultrastructural study to show activated macrophages and dendritic cells in vivo in acute Campylobacter colitis and cholera.

18393958,Virulence blockers as alternatives to antibiotics: type III secretion inhibitors against Gram-negative bacteria.,"In recent years mounting problems related to antibiotic-resistant bacteria have resulted in the prediction that we are entering the preantibiotic era. A way of preventing such a development would be to introduce novel antibacterial medicines with modes of action distinct from conventional antibiotics. Recent studies of bacterial virulence factors and toxins have resulted in increased understanding of the way in which pathogenic bacteria manipulate host cellular processes. This knowledge may now be used to develop novel antibacterial medicines that disarm pathogenic bacteria. The type III secretion system (T3SS) is known to be a potent virulence mechanism shared by a broad spectrum of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria that interact with human, animal and plant hosts by injecting effector proteins into the cytosol of host cells. Diseases, such as bubonic plague, shigellosis, salmonellosis, typhoid fever, pulmonary infections, sexually transmitted chlamydia and diarrhoea largely depend on the bacterial proteins injected by the T3SS machinery. Recently a number of T3SS inhibitors have been identified using screening-based approaches. One class of inhibitors, the salicylidene acylhydrazides, has been subjected to chemical optimization and evaluation in several in vitro and ex vivo assays in multiple bacterial species including Yersinia spp., Chlamydia spp., Salmonella spp. and Pseudotuberculosis aeruginosa. Reports published up to date indicate that T3SS inhibitors have the potential to be developed into novel antibacterial therapeutics.","['Keyser P', 'Elofsson M', 'Rosell S', 'Wolf-Watz H']",2008,264,1,J Intern Med,"Keyser P, et al.

Pharmacokinetic data in intended target species (rhesus) help to determine the proper dose regimen. Blood levels of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (enrofloxacin's active metabolite), were determined after either intramuscular or oral dosing of enrofloxacin for 7 days in a cross-over study. Levels of both antibiotics were determined by solid phase extraction followed by reversed-phase chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Results indicate enrofloxacin half-life after intramuscular dosing is estimated to be 2.4 hours. Enrofloxacin given either intramuscular or p.o. rapidly achieves satisfactory therapeutic blood levels of enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin in rhesus monkeys. Results from these pharmacokinetic study parallel values published for other animal species.

18354217,Maturation of paneth cells induces the refractory state of newborn mice to Shigella infection.,"The intestinal tract of adult mice is naturally resistant to infection by Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery in humans. Conversely, newborn mice are highly susceptible to intragastric Shigella infection and develop inflammatory lesions of the jejunal mucosa, very similar to those observed in the colon of dysenteric patients. However, the susceptibility period is short and one week after birth, animals have acquired a status of resistance characteristic of adult animals. To identify the developmental changes controlling the switch from disease susceptibility to resistance, we performed global gene expression analysis on noninfected and infected intestinal tissues taken from 4-day- and 7-day-old animals. Transcriptomic analysis of 4-day-old mice infected with the invasive Shigella strain showed a profile reflecting a strong inflammatory response with no evidence for retro-control, suggesting that the invasive process had occurred, whereas inflammation had been controlled after infection with the noninvasive strain. Differences in gene expression profiles between noninfected 4-day- and 7-day-old mice corresponded mainly to genes encoding anti-microbial peptides and proteases, suggesting that these molecules could be candidates for host antimicrobial resistance in the course of shigellosis. Indeed, expression of genes specific of Paneth cells was higher in 7-day- than in 4-day-old mice, and histological analysis indicated that Paneth cells were present only at day 7. Finally, using Sox9(flox/flox)-vil-cre mice, we showed that depletion of Paneth cells restored the susceptibility to Shigella of 7-day-old mice, clearly indicating that Paneth cells development is crucial for the clearance of intestinal infection.","['Fernandez MI', 'Regnault B', 'Mulet C', 'Tanguy M', 'Jay P', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Pédron T']",2008,180,7,J Immunol,"Fernandez MI, et al.

18348481,"Weather and the transmission of bacillary dysentery in Jinan, northern China: a time-series analysis.","OBJECTIVES: This article aims to quantify the relationship between weather variations and bacillary dysentery in Jinan, a city in northern China with a temperate climate, to reach a better understanding of the effect of weather variations on enteric infections.
METHODS: The weather variables and number of cases of bacillary dysentery during the period 1987-2000 has been studied on a monthly basis. The Spearman correlation between each weather variable and dysentery cases was conducted. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were used to perform the regression analyses.
RESULTS: Maximum temperature (one-month lag), minimum temperature (one-month lag), rainfall (one-month lag), relative humidity (without lag), and air pressure (one-month lag) were all significantly correlated with the number of dysentery cases in Jinan. After controlling for the seasonality, lag time, and long-term trend, the SARIMA model suggested that a 1 degree C rise in maximum temperature might relate to more than 10% (95% confidence interval 10.19, 12.69) increase in the cases of bacillary dysentery in this city.
CONCLUSIONS: Weather variations have already affected the transmission of bacillary dysentery in China. Temperatures could be used as a predictor of the number of dysentery cases in a temperate city in northern China. Public health interventions should be undertaken at this stage to adapt and mitigate the possible consequences of climate change in the future.","['Zhang Y', 'Bi P', 'Hiller JE']",2008,123,1,Public Health Rep,"Zhang Y, et al.

Three hundred and forty nine stool samples were collected from diarrhoea patients from different places of Kathmandu valley and examined at National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), Teku, Kathmandu. Acute diarrhoea becomes epidemic in rainy season and is a major public health problem of the city. In this study, people with poor hygiene practice and poor education were infected more than other people. Among the 349 patients with the gastrointestinal disease, 26.0% were found to have bacterial infection. Out of which, 88 (25.1%), one (0.28%), one (0.28%), and one (0.28%) were found to be Vibrio cholerae 01, Vibrio cholerae 0139, Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli respectively. Cholera cases were found almost throughout the year in the city though the numbers increased during the rainy season. It was highest during July (34.6%) followed by August (32.35%), September 32% and June (6.89%). The uncommon species of Vibrio i.e. Vibrio cholerae 0139 was also found in the study. Higher prevalence was found in urban areas (83.52%) than in rural areas (16.48%).

However, developing countries, where there is poor hygiene and unsafe water supplies, are especially affected. In the last two decades Shigella isolates have become increasingly resistant to many commonly used drugs. We investigated the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Shigella isolated from stool specimens processed over five years in the bacteriology laboratory of the University of Gondar Teaching Hospital in northwest Ethiopia. Stool specimens were processed using standard bacteriological methods and data on bacterial culture, isolation and antimicrobial sensitivity were collected in the laboratory logbook. From a total of 2891 cultures stool specimens, 214 yielded Shigella. The overall sensitivity of Shigella to the commonly used antibiotics was: gentamicin (92.1%), ciprofloxacin (91.1%), chloramphenicol (47.2%), cotrimoxazole (26.6%), ampicillin (20.1%) and tetracycline (14%). About 46% of the isolates were resistant to at least three of the most commonly used drugs and 1.4% were resistant to all the commonly used drugs. The results demonstrated continued sensitivity of Shigella to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin and widespread resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole. It is recommended that the use of gentamicin and ciprofloxacin be strictly regulated in the treatment of severe cases in regions where shigellosis is endemic and where the occasional epidemics result in high mortality.","['Yismaw G', 'Negeri C', 'Kassu A']",2008,38,1,Trop Doct,"Yismaw G, et al.

This paper provides distribution of individual Shigella species in space, and ecological covariates for shigellosis in Nha Trang, Vietnam. Data on shigellosis in neighborhoods were used to identify ecological covariates. A Bayesian hierarchical model was used to obtain joint posterior distribution of model parameters and to construct smoothed risk maps for shigellosis. Neighborhoods with a high proportion of worshippers of traditional religion, close proximity to hospital, or close proximity to the river had increased risk for shigellosis. The ecological covariates associated with Shigella flexneri differed from the covariates for Shigella sonnei. In contrast the spatial distribution of the two species was similar. The disease maps can help identify high-risk areas of shigellosis that can be targeted for interventions. This approach may be useful for the selection of populations and the analysis of vaccine trials.","['Kim DR', 'Ali M', 'Thiem VD', 'Park JK', 'von Seidlein L', 'Clemens J']",2008,14,4,Health Place,"Kim DR, et al.

18276045,Immunogenicity and efficacy of highly purified invasin complex vaccine from Shigella flexneri 2a.,"Development of a subunit vaccine for shigellosis requires identification of protective antigens and delivering these antigens in a manner that stimulates immunity comparable to that induced by natural infection. The Shigella invasin complex (Invaplex) vaccine is an ion-exchange-purified extract from virulent Shigella that consists of LPS and several other proteins, including the invasins IpaB and IpaC. Intranasal delivery of Invaplex stimulates protective immunity in small animal models for shigellosis. To identify the active component(s) of Invaplex responsible for its immunogenicity and efficacy, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to separate Invaplex into several different fractions. A high-molecular mass complex with a molecular mass between 669 MDa and 2 MDa consisted primarily of LPS, IpaB and IpaC and was considered to be a highly purified (HP) form of Invaplex. Using the mouse lung model to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of the SEC fractions it was clearly demonstrated that the high-molecular mass complex of the invasins and LPS was responsible for the protective capacity of parent native Invaplex. Other smaller mass SEC fractions were mostly non-immunogenic and did not stimulate solid protection. In guinea pigs, the HP Invaplex stimulated an enhanced immune response as compared to the parent Invaplex and was fully protective. Isolation and characterization of the immunogenic and protective moiety within Invaplex will allow better standardization of the Invaplex product and may allow future development of an Invaplex assembled from purified components.","['Turbyfill KR', 'Kaminski RW', 'Oaks EV']",2008,26,10,Vaccine,"Turbyfill KR, et al.

18267319,Extracellular-loop peptide antibodies reveal a predominant hemichannel organization of connexins in polarized intestinal cells.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, invades colonic epithelial cells to elicit an intense inflammatory reaction leading to destruction of the mucosa. ATP-dependent paracrine signalling induced by connexin (Cx) hemichannel opening was previously shown to favor Shigella flexneri invasion and dissemination in transfectants of HeLa cells [G. Tran Van Nhieu, C. Clair, R. Bruzzone, M. Mesnil, P. Sansonetti and L. Combettes. (2003). Connexin-dependent intercellular communication increases invasion and dissemination of Shigella in epithelial cells. Nat. Cell Biol. 5, 720-726.]. However, although Cxs have been described in polarized epithelial cells, little is known about their structural organization and the role of hemichannels during S. flexneri invasion. We show here that polarized Caco-2/TC7 cells express significant amounts of Cx26, Cx32 and Cx43, but that unexpectedly, cell-cell coupling assessed by dye-transfer experiments is inefficient. Consistent with a predominant Cx organization in hemichannels, dye loading induced by low calcium was readily observed, with preferential loading at the basolateral side. Antibodies (Abs) against connexin extracellular loop peptides (CELAbs) demonstrated the importance of hemichannel signalling since they inhibited dye uptake at low calcium and at physiological calcium concentrations during S. flexneri invasion. Importantly, CELAbs allowed the visualization of hemichannels at the surface of epithelial cells, as structures distinct from gap intercellular junctions.","['Clair C', 'Combettes L', 'Pierre F', 'Sansonetti P', 'Tran Van Nhieu G']",2008,314,6,Exp Cell Res,"Clair C, et al.

18261440,[Shigellosis outbreak with 146 cases related to a fair].,"BACKGROUND: On September 3, 2005, the Ciudad Real Public Health Service (Spain) received a report of 20 cases of gastroenteritis in the municipality of Daimiel. We conducted an investigation to determine the cause or causes of the outbreak and to implement control measures. Most of the cases involved young people who visited the municipality's fair.
METHODS: We carried out a descriptive study and an analytic case-control study. In the descriptive study, all variables of interest available in the medical records were included. In the case-control study, each case was matched with a control by age (plus or minus 5 years), gender, and attendance at the fair. Sixty-five cases and 65 controls were finally included in the study. Samples of foods and stools from food handlers were taken.
RESULTS: We found 196 cases, 146 of which were confirmed. The epidemic curve suggested a common source of infection with a short period of activity. The case-control study showed an association between infection and eating potatoes with a sauce at any of the fair's five food stalls (OR = 20.56; 95%CI, 6.15-75.93; p < 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis showed an association with eating potatoes in food stall number 2 (OR = 6.38; 95%CI, 1.70-23.90; p < 0.0059). Neither samples of foods nor stools from food handlers yielded any positive results. However, Shigella sonnei was isolated from stool samples from 20 cases.

Antimicrobials decrease the duration of diarrhea and pathogen excretion. However, the increasing resistance limits their therapeutic value.
AIM: To study Shigella serotype distribution in the Metropolitan Region in Chile, and its relationship with severity of disease, antimicrobial resistance pattern and clonality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: During summer 2004-2005, stool samples from children with diarrhea were collected in Cary Blair transpon medium and cultured. Shigella isolates were serotyped using monoclonal and polyclonal commercial antibodies. In vitro activity of ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazol, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and azythromycin was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Clonality was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using Xbal as restriction enzyme.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty nine Shigella strains were isolated (77 S sonnei and 62 S flexneri). S sonnei and S flexneri 2a serotypes were responsible for 95% of episodes. Children aged 2-4 years, showed a greater incidence of Shigella infections and 77% of episodes were treated on an ambulatory basis. High resistance levels were observed for ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and chloramphenicol (67%, 60%, 56% and 45%, respectively). We found 11 resistance patterns and 61,2% of strains were multiresistant. There were multiple clones without a strict relationship with resistance patterns.

METHOD: Mice were randomly divided into four groups with 10 mice in each group: control group (control), BSD group, Huoxiang Zhengqi liquid treated BSD groups at high dosage and low dosage (HXZQ high, HXZQ low). HXZQ was administrated from the day of diarrhea induction at dosage of 5.21 g kg(-1) and 0.52 g kg (-1) respectively. Peyer's patch and periphery lymphocytes were prepared for flow cytometry, and level of TNF-alpha in periphery and enteric tissue homogenate were determined with ELISA. Student's t-test was used for statistics.
RESULT: Mice in BSD group started showing continuous diarrhea at the day of induction till the fourth day when the mice were sacrificed. Diarrhea in the mice of HXZQ high and low groups lasted for 36 and 54 h respectively. There were more CD4+ and CD8+ cells in periphery, less CD4+ cells in peyer's patch in BSD mice comparing to normal mice. In peyer's patch, there were more CD8+ cells in mice in HXZQ high and low groups and more CD4+ in mice in HXZQ high group. Higher level TNF-alpha in periphery and intestinal tissue homogenate in BSD group were observed. Mice in HXZQ high group showed the decreased level TNF-alpha in periphery and enteric tissue homogenate.
CONCLUSION: The immune regulation on peyer's patch CD4+ and CD8+ cells and suppression on TNF-alpha level in enteric homogenate might partially explain the effect of HXZQ on improvement of BSD.","['He YH', 'Luo XJ', 'Qian XW', 'Wu ZP', 'Lv AP']",2007,32,22,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,"He YH, et al.

18250973,Modulating the immune response by oral zinc supplementation: a single approach for multiple diseases.,"Zinc is required for multiple cellular tasks, and especially the immune system depends on a sufficient availability of this essential trace element. During the last decades, many studies attempted to affect the outcome of various diseases by zinc supplementation. These efforts either aimed at supporting immunity by zinc administration or at correcting a loss of zinc secondary to the disease to restore the zinc-dependent functions of the immune system. This review aims to summarize the respective findings and to discuss possible molecular mechanisms by which zinc could influence viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, autoimmune diseases, and the response to vaccination. Zinc supplementation in diseases such as diarrhea, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, pneumonia, acute lower respiratory infection, and leishmaniasis seems beneficial. In contrast, the results for the common cold and malaria are still not conclusive, and zinc was ineffective in most vaccination and rheumatoid arthritis studies. For AIDS and type 1 diabetes, zinc supplementation may even be a risk factor for increased mortality or deterioration of the glucose metabolism, respectively. In these cases, zinc supplementation should be used with care and limited to clearly zinc-deficient individuals.","['Overbeck S', 'Rink L', 'Haase H']",2008,56,1,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),"Overbeck S, et al.

Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) provides valuable polymorphic markers for genotyping and performing phylogenetic analyses of highly homogeneous bacterial pathogens. Here, we assess the capability of MLVA for Shigella typing. Thirty-two potentially polymorphic VNTRs were selected by analyzing in silico five Shigella genomic sequences and subsequently evaluated. Eventually, a panel of 15 VNTRs was selected (i.e., MLVA15 analysis). MLVA15 analysis of 78 strains or genome sequences of Shigella spp. and 11 strains or genome sequences of Escherichia coli distinguished 83 genotypes. Shigella population cluster analysis gave consistent results compared to MLST. MLVA15 analysis showed capabilities for E. coli typing, providing classification among pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. coli strains included in the study. The resulting data can be queried on our genotyping webpage (http://mlva.u-psud.fr). The MLVA15 assay is rapid, highly discriminatory, and reproducible for Shigella and Escherichia strains, suggesting that it could significantly contribute to epidemiological trace-back analysis of Shigella infections and pathogenic Escherichia outbreaks. Typing was performed on strains obtained mostly from collections. Further studies should include strains of much more diverse origins, including all pathogenic E. coli types.","['Gorgé O', 'Lopez S', 'Hilaire V', 'Lisanti O', 'Ramisse V', 'Vergnaud G']",2008,46,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Gorgé O, et al.

18181399,Death from multi-resistant shigelloses: a case study from Fiji.,"Death from Shigellosis is rare in developed countries, however it causes over a million deaths in developing countries worldwide annually. Death from shigellosis is rare in Fiji. However, the global problem of emerging multi-drug resistance raises some issues about the management of Shigellosis in this country. Within Fiji, Shigella is a notifiable disease. The Fiji Ministry of Health recorded 68 cases of Shigella in 1996, 173 cases in 1997 and 334 cases in 1998 (no data available for 1999). There was only one recorded death during this time--in 1998. Resistance to chloramphenicol occurred in 82% of cases. Shigella flexneri in Fiji remains sensitive to cephalothin and cefaclor. The current antibiotic guidelines in Fiji, recommend that antibiotics be used only for cases of moderate and severe dysentery. Shigellosis was suspected soon after presentation however the patient was unable to take oral antibiotics and was treated with intravenous antibiotics (chloramphenicol and ampicillin), which were ineffective due to resistance of the organism. The current antibiotic guidelines for severe dysentry recommend chloramphenicol or nalidixic acid--the later not available in Fiji. However the only intravenous drugs that retain their sensitivity to Shigella--ceftriaxone and cephalothin, are expensive ($F 45.00 per vial' of ceftdaxone) and these are only available in large regional hospitals.",['Watson C'],2006,13,2,Pac Health Dialog,Watson C.

23055862,Options for treating resistant Shigella species infections in children.,"Infection due to Shigella species remains an important public health problem, especially in developing countries where it remains the most common cause of bloody diarrhea. In the United States (US), 10,000 to 15,000 cases of shigellosis are reported each year in both children and adults. US surveillance data from 2004 has demonstrated increased resistance in Shigella species to first-line antibiotics such as ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with approximately 37% of isolates demonstrating resistance to both ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Since approximately 69% of Shigella infections occur in children younger than 5 years of age, it is important that alternative antibiotics other than typical first-line agents such as ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole be available to treat Shigella infections in this population. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends cefixime, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and fluoroquinolones as alternative antibiotics for the treatment of Shigella species infections in children. This paper will review the microbiology, susceptibility, efficacy and safety data of these alternative antibiotics with regard to the treatment of Shigella species infections in children, and will attempt to define the role of each of these agents in the pediatric population.","['Erdman SM', 'Buckner EE', 'Hindler JF']",2008,13,1,J Pediatr Pharmacol Ther,"Erdman SM, et al.

18156720,[Clinical Characteristics of Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Producing Shigella sonnei Infection Outbreaked in Chungju Area.].,"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Shigella sonnei enteritis, especially in pediatric populations, was unprecedented not only in Korea, but also throughout the world in the past. This study was intended to devise a management guideline for shigellosis caused by an ESBL-producing strain based on analysis of the clinical manifestations and response to therapy.
METHODS: We examined 24 strains of S. sonnei isolated from stool cultures of patients with acute enteritis, between November 2004 and February 2005, for antimicrobial susceptibility and ESBL production, and we also performed DNA sequencing with PCR for the typing of ESBL genes. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and therapeutic responses to antibiotics of the 103 patients who grew S. sonnei on stool cultures.
RESULTS: All 24 isolates showed a very similar antibiotic sensitivity pattern and were ESBL gene type of CTX-M-14. The most frequent clinical symptom in the 103 patients was a fever, followed by diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, and nausea. Leukocytosis and CRP were positive in 53.4% and 78.6% of the patients, respectively. On stool direct smears, 11.7% showed more than 50 WBCs per HPF and 71% were positive on stool occult blood. Microbiological eradication rates were as follows: azithromycin and ciprofloxacin, 100%; imipenem-cilastatin, 68.8%; ampicillin-sulbactam, 42.9%; amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 20%; ceftizoxime, 12.5%; cefdinir, 6.9%; and ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 0%.
CONCLUSIONS: We presumed that, given its cost-effectiveness and safety, azithromycin can be an attractive option for the treatment of ESBL-producing S. sonnei enteritis in pediatric populations. Although ciprofloxacin is another cost-effective agent, its use in pediatric populations is not recommended.","['Hong SJ', 'Lee CH', 'Wang JH', 'Song W', 'Jung SH']",2006,26,3,Korean J Lab Med,"Hong SJ, et al.

The study was carried out from October 2004 to October 2005 and involved patients attending Sekou Toure Regional Hospital and Butimba Health Centre. Bacteriological cultures were done at the National Institute for Medical Research laboratory. A total of 489 patients (median age = 20 years) participated in the study and were able to provide stool specimens. Shigella species were isolated from 14% (69/489) of the stool specimens collected. Of the sixty nine strains of Shigella spp isolated, 62 (90%) were S. flexneri and 7 (10%) were S. dysenteriae. All Shigella strains isolated showed high resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and chloramphenicol, drugs commonly used for management of shigellosis in Tanzania. However all isolates were fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, cefuroxime and gentamycin. S. flexneri showed resistance to amoxy-clavulanic_acid and azithromycin in 5% and 2% of isolates, respectively. None of the S. dysenteriae isolates were resistant to these two drugs. Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Schistosoma mansoni were microscopically detected in 16.5%, 4.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively.

METHODS: S. flexneri strains were isolated by standard bacterial methods from fecal specimens of children attending to the 3 children's hospitals. Phenotype analysis for screening virulent of strains of S. flexneri was done on a plate of tryptic soy agar contained 0.003% Congo red dye. Whole membrane protein preparations were used to examine the protein profiles of the inner and outer membrane of these Gram-negative bacteria. The protein mixture was electrophoresed through a polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 and destained with ethanol and acetic acid. HeLa cell culture was done by two-step preparations: one for light microscopy and the other for electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Some of S. flexneri (46%) were Congo red positive colonies. S. flexneri with negative Congo red phenotype could not enter the HeLa cell culture. A 120 kDa protein band was found in 46% of these bacteria which could enter into HeLa cell culture. Pseudopod structures which facilitate bacterial cell-to-cell spread were readily identified by electron microscopy.
DISCUSSION: Since the existence of 120-kDa protein band was corresponded to enter of S. flexneri into the HeLa cell culture and correlated with Congo red dye positive, for identification of invasive and non-invasive S. flexneri strains, the use of a 120-kDa protein band by SDS-PAGE or a simple, rapid and very cheap Congo red dye method is recommended. Because, there are some deaths due to Shigella sp. in our country, notification on the isolation of these bacteria in both children hospitals laboratories and private clinical laboratories is important.","['Hakemi Vala M', 'Nowroozi J', 'Ghazi F', 'Nabavi Tabatabai P', 'Haghighi S']",2007,11,1,Iran Biomed J,"Hakemi Vala M, et al.

18042252,Muramylpeptide shedding modulates cell sensing of Shigella flexneri.,"Bacterial infections trigger the activation of innate immunity through the interaction of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with pattern recognition molecules (PRMs). The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (Nod) proteins are intracellular PRMs that recognize muramylpeptides contained in peptidoglycan (PGN) of bacteria. It is still unclear how Nod1 physically interacts with PGN, a structure internal to the Gram-negative bacterial envelope. To contribute to the understanding of this process, we demonstrate that, like Escherichia coli, Bordetella pertussis and Neisseria gonorrheae, the Gram-negative pathogen Shigella spontaneously releases PGN fragments and that this process can be increased by inactivating either ampG or mppA, genes involved in PGN recycling. Both Shigella mutants, but especially the strain carrying the mppA deletion, trigger Nod1-mediated NF-kappaB activation to a greater extent than the wild-type strain. Likewise, muramylpeptides spontaneously shed by Shigella are able per se to trigger a Nod1-mediated response consistent with the relative amount. Finally, we found that qualitative changes in muramylpeptide shedding can alter in vivo host responses to Shigella infection. Our findings support the idea that muramylpeptides released by pathogens during infection could modulate the immune response through Nod proteins and thereby influence the outcome of disease.","['Nigro G', 'Fazio LL', 'Martino MC', 'Rossi G', 'Tattoli I', 'Liparoti V', 'De Castro C', 'Molinaro A', 'Philpott DJ', 'Bernardini ML']",2008,10,3,Cell Microbiol,"Nigro G, et al.

This study was designed to examine the effect of this yeast on infection by Shigella flexneri, a highly infectious and human host-adapted enteric pathogen. We investigated key interactions between the bacteria and host cells in the presence of the yeast in addition to a number of host responses including proinflammatory events and markers. Although the presence of the yeast during infection did not alter the number of bacteria that was able to attach or invade human colon cancer-derived T-84 cells, it did positively impact the tight junction protein zonula occluden-2 and significantly increase the barrier integrity of model epithelia. The yeast also decreased ERK, JNK, and NF-kappaB activation in response to S. flexneri, events likely responsible for the observed reductions in IL-8 secretion and the transepithelial migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes across T-84 monolayers. These results, suggesting that the yeast allowed for a dampened inflammatory response, were confirmed in vivo utilizing a highly relevant model of human fetal colonic tissue transplanted into scid mice. Furthermore, a cell-free S. boulardii culture supernatant was also capable of reducing IL-8 secretion by infected T-84 cells. These data suggest that although the use of S. boulardii during infection with S. flexneri may alleviate symptoms associated with the inflammatory response of the host, it would not prevent infection.","['Mumy KL', 'Chen X', 'Kelly CP', 'McCormick BA']",2008,294,3,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,"Mumy KL, et al.

18031340,The distribution of insertion sequences in the genome of Shigella flexneri strain 2457T.,"Shigella flexneri, which causes shigellosis in humans, evolved from Escherichia coli. The sequencing of Shigella genomes has revealed that a large number of insertion sequence (IS) elements (over 200 elements) reside in the genome. Although the presence of these elements has been noted previously and summarized, more detailed analyses are required to understand their evolutionary significance. Here, the genome of S. flexneri strain 2457T is used to investigate the spatial distribution of IS copies around the chromosome and the location of elements with respect to genes. It is found that most IS isoforms occur essentially randomly around the genome. Two exceptions are IS91 and IS911, which appear to cluster due to local hopping. The location of IS elements with respect to genes is biased, however, revealing the action of natural selection. The non-coding regions of the genome (no more than 21%) carry disproportionally more IS elements (at least 28%) than the coding regions, implying that selection acts against insertion into genes. Of the genes disrupted by ISs, those involved in signal transduction, intracellular trafficking, and cell motility are most commonly targeted, suggesting selection against genes in these categories.","['Zaghloul L', 'Tang C', 'Chin HY', 'Bek EJ', 'Lan R', 'Tanaka MM']",2007,277,2,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Zaghloul L, et al.

Effectors alter cell signaling and host responses induced upon infection; however, their precise biochemical activities have been elucidated in very few cases. Utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a surrogate host, we show that the Shigella effector IpaH9.8 interrupts pheromone response signaling by promoting the proteasome-dependent destruction of the MAPKK Ste7. In vitro, IpaH9.8 displayed ubiquitin ligase activity toward ubiquitin and Ste7. Replacement of a Cys residue that is invariant among IpaH homologs of plant and animal pathogens abolished the ubiquitin ligase activity of IpaH9.8. We also present evidence that the IpaH homolog SspH1 from Salmonella enterica can ubiquitinate ubiquitin and PKN1, a previously identified SspH1 interaction partner.

A significant increase in resistance to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (from 52% to 72%, p < 0.01) and nalidixic acid (from 19% to 51%, p < 0.01) was detected. High, but unchanged, resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol, low resistance to mecillinam (resistance 3%, intermediate 3%), and to emergence of resistance to azithromycin (resistance 16%, intermediate 62%) and ceftriaxone/cefixime (2%) were detected in 2001-2002. Of 266 recent isolates, 63% were resistant to > or =3 anti-Shigella drugs (multidrug-resistant [MDR]) compared to 52% of 369 strains (p < 0.007) in 1991-1992. Of 154 isolates tested by E-test in 2001-2002, 71% were nalidixic acid-resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] > or =32 microg/mL) and had 10-fold higher MIC90 (0.25 microg/mL) to ciprofloxacin than that of nalidixic acid-susceptible strains exhibiting decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility, which were detected as ciprofloxacin-susceptible and nalidixic acid-resistant by the disc-diffusion method. These strains were frequently associated with MDR traits. High modal MICs were observed to azithromycin (MIC 6 microg/mL) and nalidixic acid (MIC 128 micdrog/mL) and low to ceftriaxone (MIC 0.023 microg/mL). Conjugative R-plasmids-encoded extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was responsible for resistance to ceftriaxone/cefixime.

17984206,"The NleE/OspZ family of effector proteins is required for polymorphonuclear transepithelial migration, a characteristic shared by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri infections.","Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Shigella flexneri are human host-specific pathogens that infect intestinal epithelial cells. However, each bacterial species employs a different infection strategy within this environmental niche. EPEC attaches to the apical surface of small intestine enterocytes, causing microvillus effacement and rearrangement of the host cell cytoskeleton beneath adherent bacteria. In contrast, S. flexneri invades the large intestine epithelium at the basolateral membrane, replicates, and spreads cell to cell. Both EPEC and S. flexneri rely on type three secretion systems (T3SS) to secrete effectors into host cells, and both pathogens recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from the submucosa to the lumen of the intestine. In this report, we compared the virulence functions of the EPEC T3SS effector NleE and the homologous Shigella protein Orf212. We discovered that Orf212 was secreted by the S. flexneri T3SS and renamed this protein OspZ. Infection of polarized T84 intestinal epithelial cells with an ospZ deletion mutant of S. flexneri resulted in reduced PMN transepithelial migration compared to infection by the wild type. An nleE deletion mutant of EPEC showed a similar reduction of PMN migration. The ability to induce PMN migration was restored in both mutants when either ospZ or nleE was expressed from a plasmid. An infection of T84 cells with the delta ospZ mutant resulted in reduced extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation compared to infection with the wild type. Therefore, we conclude that OspZ and NleE have similar roles in the upstream induction of host signaling pathways required for PMN transepithelial migration in Shigella and EPEC infections.","['Zurawski DV', 'Mumy KL', 'Badea L', 'Prentice JA', 'Hartland EL', 'McCormick BA', 'Maurelli AT']",2008,76,1,Infect Immun,"Zurawski DV, et al.

17969624,uspA of Shigella sonnei.,"One of the strategies that bacteria utilize to combat environmental stress is to synthesize stress-responding proteins. In Escherichia coli, adverse environmental factors, such as starvation, heat, and the presence of acid, oxidants, heavy metals, and antibiotics, trigger the expression of the universal stress protein (USP). The gene of the USP, uspA, in E. coli K-12 and E. coli O157:H7 has been identified and sequenced. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of uspA in a strain of Shigella sonnei implicated in the 1998 parsley-related outbreak of shigellosis was determined. Within an 800-bp region sequenced, there were 17 bp mismatches between the uspA of S. sonnei and that of E. coli K-12. Among the 17 mismatched nucleotides, 8 were within the structure gene of uspA. A total of 12 bp variations were identified between the uspA of S. sonnei and that of E. coli O157:H7, of which 5 bp were internal to the coding region of uspA.

METHODS: The prospective space-time scan statistic was tested by mimicking daily prospective analyses of bacillary dysentery data of Chengdu city in 2005 (3212 cases in 102 towns and villages). And the results were compared with that of purely temporal scan statistic.
RESULTS: The prospective space-time scan statistic could give specific messages both in spatial and temporal. The results of June indicated that the prospective space-time scan statistic could timely detect the outbreaks that started from the local site, and the early warning message was powerful (P = 0.007). When the merely temporal scan statistic for detecting the outbreak was sent two days later, and the signal was less powerful (P = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: The prospective space-time scan statistic could make full use of the spatial and temporal information in infectious disease data and could timely and effectively detect the outbreaks that start from the local sites.

Effective antibiotic treatment reduces the average duration of illness by reducing faecal excretion of the bacterium and preventing further transmission and potentially lethal complications. Treatment of shigellosis is currently limited by the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains of Shigella. Although fluoroquinolones are currently effective in treating adults, resistance to fluoroquinolones among Shigella spp. is emerging, and their use in children is subject to limitations. Azithromycin and third-generation cephalosporins are also effective in the treatment of shigellosis, but monitoring of Shigella isolates to detect the emergence of resistance is essential.",['Niyogi SK'],2007,13,12,Clin Microbiol Infect,Niyogi SK.

17932464,A role for Nod-like receptors in autophagy induced by Shigella infection.,"Shigella infection, the cause of bacillary dysentery, induces caspase-1 activation and cell death in macrophages, but the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. In our recent study, we presented evidence that caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta processing induced by Shigella are mediated through Ipaf, a cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family and the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC). We also show that Ipaf and caspase-1 were critical for pyroptosis, a specialized form of caspase-1-dependent cell death induced in macrophages by bacterial infection, whereas ASC is dispensable. Notably, infection of macrophages with Shigella induced autophagy, which was dramatically increased by the absence of caspase-1 or Ipaf, but not ASC. Furthermore, autophagy induction was associated with transient resistance to pyroptosis. These results indicate that autophagy in macrophages is regulated by the Ipaf inflammasome, providing a novel function for NLR proteins in bacterial-host interactions.","['Suzuki T', 'Núñez G']",2008,4,1,Autophagy,Suzuki T and Núñez G.

17888583,Role of Shigella infection in endometriosis: a novel hypothesis.,"Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial cells and stroma at ectopic sites outside the uterine cavity. The natural history of endometriosis is uncertain, its etiology unknown, the clinical presentation inconsistent, diagnosis difficult and the treatment poorly standardized. It causes significant morbidity due to pelvic pain and infertility among 15-25% of women during their reproductive age. The benign disease causes peritoneal inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions and ovarian cysts but displays features of malignancy, like neo-vascularization, local invasion and distant metastasis. Mechanical, hormonal, immunological, environmental and genetic factors have been implicated in its etiology but provide inconclusive explanations. Present study was carried out on ectopic and eutopic endometriotic tissue specimens collected during laproscopy/laprotomy from cases of endometriosis. mRNA was isolated from the tissues and converted to cDNA by RT and subsequently subjected to differential display Polymerase Chain Reaction using seven sets of arbitrary primers. A unique band was identified only in the ectopic endometriotic tissue, which was sequenced. BLAST search results revealed sequence homology to shigella bacterial DNA leading us to hypothesize that infection may be playing a role in the etiology of endometriosis. This is the first report implicating the role of bacterial infection in the etiology of endometriosis. Shigella is known to invade the mucosa of the colon through the feco-oral route causing Shigellosis. The pathogenesis of shigellosis involves inflammation, ulceration, haemorrhage, tissue destruction and fibrosis of the colonic mucosa resulting in abdominal pain and diarrhoea/dysentery, this is similar to the pathogenesis of endometriosis which also involves inflammation, haemorrhage, tissue destruction and fibrotic adhesions of the pelvic peritoneum resulting in abdominal pain and infertility. The non-motile shigella bacteria invade the deeper mucosal layers by travelling from cell to cell of colonic epithelium, reaching the lamina propria of the colonic mucosa. We propose that, by the same mechanism, the bacteria travel across the colon wall to reach the outer peritoneal surface of the colon, which is in close proximity to the posterior uterine surface in the Pouch of Douglas, the site which incidentally happens to be the commonest site of early endometriosis. Our hypothesis therefore proposes that shigella or shigella-like organisms may be the trigger for the initiation of immunological changes in the pelvic peritoneum causing endometriosis. Once the endometrial cells are implanted at ectopic sites they are sustained by hormones and angiogenic factors. Hence ""Infection hypothesis"" provides a novel explanation for the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis.","['Kodati VL', 'Govindan S', 'Movva S', 'Ponnala S', 'Hasan Q']",2008,70,2,Med Hypotheses,"Kodati VL, et al.

A total of 26 VNTR loci were identified by exploring the repeat sequence loci in the genomic sequences of S. sonnei strains Ss046 and 53G and by testing 536 isolates that had previously been characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The discriminatory power of MLVA (Simpson's index of diversity [D], 0.9524; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9373 to 0.9564) for the 536 isolates was significantly higher than that of PFGE (D, 0.8882; CI, 0.8667 to 0.9097). MLVA typing with the four and eight most variable loci had D values of 0.9468 and 0.9481, respectively, results approaching that of 26 loci. The usefulness of MLVA for outbreak investigation was evaluated using 151 isolates from 10 shigellosis outbreaks and 22 PFGE-indistinguishable isolates collected from nine epidemiologically unrelated events in five different countries. The evaluations indicated that MLVA was a powerful typing tool to distinguish isolates for outbreak investigation and that it exhibited a good discrimination of the 22 PFGE-indistinguishable isolates. Single-locus variants did occur during the outbreak; therefore, S. sonnei isolates with MLVA profiles differing at no more than a single locus should be considered part of the same outbreak. The present study suggests that MLVA has the potential to replace PFGE as a standard method of typing S. sonnei isolates for disease surveillance and outbreak investigation.","['Liang SY', 'Watanabe H', 'Terajima J', 'Li CC', 'Liao JC', 'Tung SK', 'Chiou CS']",2007,45,11,J Clin Microbiol,"Liang SY, et al.

METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients with shigella gastroenteritis presenting to Sami Ulus Children's Hospital from June 2002 to December 2002 were included in the study. The clinical and laboratory data of the patients with shigellosis were collected by chart review. Male/female ratio was 1.35 and mean age was 4.83 +/- 3.2 years (range: 1-16 years). Shigella sonnei (83.3%) was the most common serogroup. This was followed by S. flexneri (10.1%), then S. dysenteria (5.1%), and S. boydii (1.5%). The antibiotic susceptibility of the shigella strains was determined. Most strains of Shigella species were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (90.4%). All strains were found to be sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100%). Ampicillin susceptibility was 86.4% and cefotaxim (and/or ceftriaxon) susceptibility was 98%.
CONCLUSION: Ampicillin is the drug of choice in the treatment of shigella infection in this region of Turkey. Cefotaxim or ceftriaxon was the second choice of antibiotics. Thus, Shigella is an important etiologic agent of diarrhea in Turkey. To determine the antibiotic susceptibility of the Shigella strains and appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment in Turkey, further studies will be needed.","['Karacan C', 'Tavil B', 'Topal Y', 'Zorlu P', 'Tayman C']",2007,49,5,Pediatr Int,"Karacan C, et al.

METHODS: In the present study, Shigella- and Salmonella-related diarrhea was studied among 3570 children in Gaza, Palestine from January 1999 to September 2006 to determine the prevalence and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates.
RESULTS: The frequency of isolation was 1.8% (65/3570) for Salmonella spp. and 0.8% (28/3570) for Shigella spp. Shigella flexneri (16/28) was the most frequently isolated Shigella species. Most of the Shigella isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (89%), ampicillin (79%) and chloramphenicol (46%) and most of the Salmonella isolates showed resistance to ampicillin (62%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (35%), chloramphenicol (35%) and cephalexin (26%).
CONCLUSION: These data reinforce the need for continuous monitoring of microbiological and antimicrobial surveillance and the necessity to regulate the use of antimicrobials. According to the current study, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol should not be used as empiric treatment of diarrhea in children.","['Abu Elamreen FH', 'Sharif FA', 'Deeb JE']",2008,23,8 Pt 2,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Abu Elamreen FH, et al.

17851659,Transcriptional profile induced by furazolidone treatment of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri is a facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for endemic shigellosis especially in developing countries. Furazolidone, a nitrofuran derivative, is very effective against the infection with S. flexneri. To examine potential effects of furazolidone on this germ, a whole-genome DNA microarray was constructed and transcriptional profiles of the responses to furazolidone were determined. The expressing data revealed adaptive responses of S. flexneri to oxidative stress induced by furazolidone treatment. Iron metabolism was found to be disturbed by furazolidone through derepression of the iron uptake regulon. In addition, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, cofactors metabolism, and DNA repair system were also affected by the drug. These data establish a potential for furazolidone to enhance free radical reactions through reductive activation by oxygen-sensitive nitroreductase. Moreover, we provide evidence that furazolidone is able to cause metabolic dysfunction, which cannot always be attributed to oxidative stress, and interactions between reductive metabolites of furazolidone and S. flexneri should be considered.","['Fu H', 'Leng W', 'Wang J', 'Zhang W', 'Peng J', 'Wang L', 'Jin Q']",2007,77,3,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,"Fu H, et al.

This study was to reveal the antimicrobial resistance status of Shigella isolates through the National Shigellosis Surveillance System in 2005 in China, so as to provide evidence for the development of surveillance, prevention and cure of Shigellosis.
METHODS: All the lab assistants received training from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The project prescribed the uniform experimentation, quality control method, reagent, etc. Disc diffusion test(K-B) was carried out, following the CLSI methods. Data were analyzed by WHONET 5.4 software.
RESULTS: (1) 3 serotypes were identified and S. flexneri was common that accounted for 75.5% of all Shigella isolates followed by 24.4% of S. sonnei, but only 1 strain of S. dysenteriae was separated. (2) The resistant rates to tetracycline and ampicillin in Shigella spp were quite high, as over 90.0%. However, the resistant rate to Cefotaxime was the lowest, only 6.1%. The resistant rates were different between serotypes with the resistant rates of S. flexneri to ampicillin, ampicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin were higher than those of S. sonnei (P < 0.001). (3) The multiple-antibiotic-resistance status in Shigella spp was quite serious and the resistant rate to five and more antimicrobials was 54.9%. The most common resistant patterns were seen on ampicillin, nalidixin, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole. (4) There were some differences in subtypes and antimicrobial resistance among different provinces.
CONCLUSION: Cefotaxime seemed the best in curing Shigellosis at the clinic level. Programs regarding monitoring subtypes and antimicrobial resistance of Shigella should be in a continuous manner so as to understand the pathogens timely and to control the disease pertinently.","['Yu HL', 'Chang ZR', 'Zhang LS', 'Zhang J', 'Li ZJ', 'Xu JG', 'Ran L']",2007,28,4,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,"Yu HL, et al.

17768231,Intracellular type III secretion by cytoplasmic Shigella flexneri promotes caspase-1-dependent macrophage cell death.,"The Gram-negative bacterium Shigella flexneri triggers pro-inflammatory apoptotic cell death in macrophages, which is crucial for the onset of an acute inflammatory diarrhoea termed bacillary dysentery. The Mxi-Spa type III secretion system promotes bacterial uptake and escape into the cytoplasm, where, dependent on the translocator/effector protein IpaB, caspase-1 [interleukin (IL)-1beta-converting enzyme] and its substrate IL-1beta are activated. Here, we show that in the course of a macrophage infection, IpaB is secreted intracellularly for more than 1 h post-infection and progressively accumulates in aggregates on the bacterial surface. Concomitantly, the bacterial pool of IpaB is gradually depleted. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) dose-dependently inhibited the Mxi-Spa-dependent secretion of IpaB triggered by the dye Congo red in vitro and abolished translocation of IpaB into the host-cell cytoplasm of S. flexneri-infected macrophages. CCCP specifically inhibited S. flexneri-triggered macrophage death in a dose-dependent manner, even if added up to 60 min post-infection. Addition of CCCP 15 min after infection blocked macrophage cell death, the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of IL-1beta, without affecting uptake or escape of S. flexneri from the phagosome. By contrast, CCCP used at the same concentration had no effect on ATP-induced caspase-1 activation or staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Our results indicate that under the conditions used, CCCP rapidly and specifically blocks bacterial type III secretion, and thus, intracellular type III secretion promotes cytotoxicity of S. flexneri.","['Schroeder GN', 'Jann NJ', 'Hilbi H']",2007,153,Pt 9,Microbiology (Reading),"Schroeder GN, et al.

In this study, we investigate the resistance and identify extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) gene in 37 S. sonnei isolates by agar dilution procedure and the modified three-dimensional test, respectively. The bla genes of ESBL-producing isolates were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. More than 50% of these strains were resistant to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, or gentamicin. However, they were still susceptible to third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and chloramphenicol. A total of 8.1% (3/37) of the isolates with intermediate susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were ESBL-producers, which produced CTX-M-14 ESBLs and TEM-1 beta-lactamases. This is the first report of CTX-M-14 in S. sonnei isolates from China and it is important to closely monitor such strains.","['Xiong Z', 'Li T', 'Xu Y', 'Li J']",2007,55,5,J Infect,"Xiong Z, et al.

17726093,Effect of the nonreducing end of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 O-specific oligosaccharides on their immunogenicity as conjugates in mice.,"Endemic and epidemic shigellosis, an acute invasive disease of the lower intestines, afflicts millions of people worldwide with an estimated one million fatalities per annum at a low infectious dose. Our approach to vaccine development against Shigella is based on the hypothesis that serum IgG antibodies to the O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) domains of the LPS of these organisms confer protection to infection. The synthetic oligosaccharides corresponding to the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the O-SP of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 covalently linked to human serum albumin elicited O-SP-specific IgG in mice. The antibody levels were a function of both the saccharide chain length and their loading on the protein. These synthetic saccharide conjugates elicited significantly higher levels of IgG anti O-SP than conjugates prepared with the O-SP from the bacteria. Here, we evaluated the influence of the nonreducing terminal monosaccharide on the serum antibody response. To this end, we prepared synthetic oligosaccharides comprising hexa- to tridecasaccharide fragments of the native O-SP, having one of the four monosaccharide residues that constitute the repeating unit at their termini and bound them to BSA by a single-point attachment. The conjugates contained an average of 19 saccharide chains per BSA. The synthetic oligosaccharides inhibited the binding of serum raised against whole bacteria to its LPS to a similar extent but lower than the native O-SP. The highest anti-LPS levels were elicited by conjugates having N-acetylglucosamine (10-mer) or galactose residues (7- and 11-mers) at their nonreducing termini.","['Pozsgay V', 'Kubler-Kielb J', 'Schneerson R', 'Robbins JB']",2007,104,36,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Pozsgay V, et al.

17719540,"A bacterial effector targets Mad2L2, an APC inhibitor, to modulate host cell cycling.","The gut epithelium self-renews every several days, providing an important innate defense system that limits bacterial colonization. Nevertheless, many bacterial pathogens, including Shigella, efficiently colonize the intestinal epithelium. Here, we show that the Shigella effector IpaB, when delivered into epithelial cells, causes cell-cycle arrest by targeting Mad2L2, an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) inhibitor. Cyclin B1 ubiquitination assays revealed that APC undergoes unscheduled activation due to IpaB interaction with the APC inhibitor Mad2L2. Synchronized HeLa cells infected with Shigella failed to accumulate Cyclin B1, Cdc20, and Plk1, causing cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in an IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent manner. IpaB/Mad2L2-dependent cell-cycle arrest by Shigella infection was also demonstrated in rabbit intestinal crypt progenitors, and the IpaB-mediated arrest contributed to efficient colonization of the host cells. These results strongly indicate that Shigella employ special tactics to influence epithelial renewal in order to promote bacterial colonization of intestinal epithelium.","['Iwai H', 'Kim M', 'Yoshikawa Y', 'Ashida H', 'Ogawa M', 'Fujita Y', 'Muller D', 'Kirikae T', 'Jackson PK', 'Kotani S', 'Sasakawa C']",2007,130,4,Cell,"Iwai H, et al.

17716434,First detection and sequence analysis of the bla-CTX-M-15 gene in Lebanese isolates of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Shigella sonnei.,"The emergence in Shigella species of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) that impart resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is a growing concern world-wide. So far, however, ESBL-producing Shigella have only been reported seven times, albeit from seven different countries. In Lebanon, three ESBL-producing clinical isolates of S. sonnei were recovered from 30 cases of shigellosis diagnosed between July 2004 and October 2005. All three were found to be resistant to amoxycillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, gentamicin, and kanamycin. Each harboured the bla-CTX-M gene, and the results of sequence analysis indicated this to be of the bla-CTX-M-15 type and encoded on a 70-kb plasmid, flanked by an insertion element (ISEcp1). The bla-TEM-1 gene was also detected on the chromosomes of two of the ESBL-producing isolates. Class-2 integrons containing dhfr1, aadA1 and sat1 genes were detected on the chromosomes of all three isolates but not on the plasmids. Fluoroquinolone-modifying factors [QnrA, QnrB, QnrS or AAC(6')-Ib-cr] were not detected. The results of RAPD analysis, combined with data on antimicrobial susceptibility, indicated that each isolate was unique. In conclusion, the emergence of ESBL-producing isolates of S. sonnei has been demonstrated for the first time in Lebanon. The resistance of these isolates to third-generation cephalosporins was mediated by the CTX-M-15 enzyme, which was plasmid-encoded.","['Matar GM', 'Jaafar R', 'Sabra A', 'Hart CA', 'Corkill JE', 'Dbaibo GS', 'Araj GF']",2007,101,6,Ann Trop Med Parasitol,"Matar GM, et al.

17696608,"Differential regulation of caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis, and autophagy via Ipaf and ASC in Shigella-infected macrophages.","Shigella infection, the cause of bacillary dysentery, induces caspase-1 activation and cell death in macrophages, but the precise mechanisms of this activation remain poorly understood. We demonstrate here that caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta processing induced by Shigella are mediated through Ipaf, a cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family, and the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC). We also show that Ipaf was critical for pyroptosis, a specialized form of caspase-1-dependent cell death induced in macrophages by bacterial infection, whereas ASC was dispensable. Unlike that observed in Salmonella and Legionella, caspase-1 activation induced by Shigella infection was independent of flagellin. Notably, infection of macrophages with Shigella induced autophagy, which was dramatically increased by the absence of caspase-1 or Ipaf, but not ASC. Autophagy induced by Shigella required an intact bacterial type III secretion system but not VirG protein, a bacterial factor required for autophagy in epithelial-infected cells. Treatment of macrophages with 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, enhanced pyroptosis induced by Shigella infection, suggesting that autophagy protects infected macrophages from pyroptosis. Thus, Ipaf plays a critical role in caspase-1 activation induced by Shigella independently of flagellin. Furthermore, the absence of Ipaf or caspase-1, but not ASC, regulates pyroptosis and the induction of autophagy in Shigella-infected macrophages, providing a novel function for NLR proteins in bacterial-host interactions.","['Suzuki T', 'Franchi L', 'Toma C', 'Ashida H', 'Ogawa M', 'Yoshikawa Y', 'Mimuro H', 'Inohara N', 'Sasakawa C', 'Nuñez G']",2007,3,8,PLoS Pathog,"Suzuki T, et al.

Stool specimens and clinical information were collected from 111 pairs of children with diarrhoea and healthy controls. A total of 73 cases (66 %) and 41 controls (36 %) had an enteric pathogen. The pathogens most often associated with diarrhoea were rotavirus (17 % of cases) and Entamoeba histolytica (15 %), followed by Shigella (5 %). Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) was found in 23 % of both patients and controls. Characterization of DEC by serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility test and PFGE showed that DEC represented by different pathotypes belonged to various serotypes. Except for three enterotoxigenic E. coli strains, typing by PFGE revealed no correlation between pathotype and serotype of DEC strains. This suggests a high prevalence of a variety of DEC subtypes in this area. For this particular region, vaccine development strategies targeting rotavirus and Shigella are likely to be of public health benefit, whereas the role of DEC and preventive measures need to be further elaborated.","['Hien BTT', 'Trang DT', 'Scheutz F', 'Cam PD', 'Mølbak K', 'Dalsgaard A']",2007,56,Pt 8,J Med Microbiol,"Hien BTT, et al.

17622331,Distribution of serogroups and serotypes of multiple drug resistant Shigella isolates.,"SUMMARY BACKGROUND: The distribution of Shigella serotypes is of epidemiological importance and antimicrobial therapy for shigellosis can prevent potential complications of shigellosis. Studies done fifty years ago in Ghana indicated the predominance of Shigella flexneri.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the distribution of Shigella serogroups and serotypes and their antibiogram profiles.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective descriptive study.
SETTING: The Microbiology Department of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.
METHODS: Consecutive stool specimens from patients with diarrhoea submitted between February 2004 and June 2005 were cultured for Shigella and the isolates typed with commercial anti-sera. The susceptibilities of the isolates were also tested against eleven antimicrobial agents by the disc diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of isolates to ciprofloxacin were also determined by the E-test.
RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety four diarrhoea stool specimens yielded 24 Shigella isolates with the following serogroup distribution: S. flexneri 70.8%, S. dysenteriae 16.7%, S. sonnei 8.3% and S. boydii 4.2%. Approximately 96% of the isolates were multi-drug resistant but all twenty four were susceptible to nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin). The MICs of twenty one of the isolates to ciprofloxacin were </= 0.064 microg ml(-1).
CONCLUSIONS: The predominance of S. flexneri was confirmed and Shigella isolates from Accra are susceptible to nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones. Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance particularly to monitor the emergence of Shigella strains resistant to nalidixic acid and the fluoroquiolones is important.","['Opintan J', 'Newman MJ']",2007,41,1,Ghana Med J,Opintan J and Newman MJ.

17602851,Risk areas and neighborhood-level risk factors for Shigella dysenteriae 1 and Shigella flexneri.,"Annually, there are 165 million cases of shigellosis resulting in 1.1 million deaths in the developing world. Two species of the causative agent, Shigella dysenteriae 1 and Shigella flexneri, are responsible for acute diarrheal illness. Vaccines are being developed against both but many questions remain about the disease burden, distribution of species in space and time, and community-level risk factors. This study answers two questions. What are the differences in neighborhood-level risk factors between S. dysenteriae 1 and S. flexneri? Does shigellosis caused by the two different species occur in the same neighborhoods and are those high-risk neighborhoods persistent in time? Cases from a hospital in rural Bangladesh were assigned to one of the two shigellosis types and age-matched individuals were randomly chosen from the community to be controls. Information was collected for neighborhood-level variables hypothesized to be related to shigellosis. During the 3-year study period, there were 161 cases of S. dysenteriae 1 and 225 cases of S. flexneri. Incidence of both types was highest in children under 2 followed by children from 2 to 5. The location of S. dysenteriae 1 risk varies in time but S. flexneri risk areas were persistent in time. Neighborhoods near bazaars with many non-septic latrines were at highest risk for S. dysenteriae 1. S. flexneri was most common in flood-controlled areas. S. dysenteriae 1 risk is more related to hygiene and sanitation and S. flexneri is more related to the environment.","['Emch M', 'Ali M', 'Yunus M']",2008,14,1,Health Place,"Emch M, et al.

19858629,"Epidemiology of Shigella-associated diarrhea in Gorgan, north of Iran.","OBJECTIVE: Shigella is an important etiological agent for diarrhea and especially dysentery. Shigellosis is an intestinal infection that is a major public health problem in many developing countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Shigella and its various species in diarrheal samples in Gorgan located in the north of Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January-December 2005, the epidemiology of Shigella- associated diarrhea was studied among 634 patients in Gorgan. The diarrheal samples accompanied with a questionnaire, which contained the demographic and main symptoms of the patients, were transported to the laboratory and inoculated in different culture media. Colonies suspected to be of Shigella were detected using differential biochemical tests and subsequently, the serotype of Shigella was defined using antisera.
RESULTS: Shigella was isolated from 56/634 diarrheal samples) (8.8%) of which S. sonnei was the predominant species (55%). Occurrence of Shigella was highest in the 2-5 years' age group (70.9%) and highest in summer (73.2%) with the most frequent clinical manifestation being abdominal pain (67.8%). The prevalence of Shigella in males and females was 8 and 9.8% respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: It has been shown that Shigella sonnei is the most common Shigella serogroup among 2-5 year-old children in Gorgan. It is therefore suggested that hygienic training be given to childcare attendants and the children themselves.","['Ghaemi EO', 'Aslani MM', 'Moradi AV', 'Dadgar T', 'Livani S', 'Mansourian AR', 'Nosrat SB', 'Ahmadi AR']",2007,13,3,Saudi J Gastroenterol,"Ghaemi EO, et al.

17587439,"Genetic relatedness among isolates of Shigella sonnei carrying class 2 integrons in Tehran, Iran, 2002-2003.","BACKGROUND: Shigella spp. are major cause of diarrhoeal disease in both developing and developed countries. Shigella sonnei is the serogroup of Shigella most frequently responsible for sporadic and epidemic enteritis in developed countries. In recent years the emergence and spread of S. sonnei biotype g carrying class 2 integron have been frequently reported in many countries. Recently, S. sonnei has been reported as the prevalent serogroup of Shigella in Iran. The present study was carried out to investigate phenotypic and genetic characteristics of Shigella sonnei isolates identified in the years 2002 and 2003 in Tehran, Iran.
METHODS: Biotyping, drug susceptibility testing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and analysis of class 2 integrons have been carried out on 60 S. sonnei isolates, including 57 sporadic isolates from paediatric cases of shigellosis occurring in 2002 and 2003, two sporadic isolates recovered in 1984 and the ATCC 9290 strain.
RESULTS: Biotype g and resistance to streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tetracycline were exhibited by 54 of the 57 recent isolates. Of the 54 biotype g isolates, 28 exhibited a class 2 integron of 2161 bp, and 24 a class 2 integron of 1371 bp, respectively. Class 2 integrons were not detected in four isolates only, including the two endemic isolates recovered in 1984 and two strains from recent sporadic cases. PFGE divided the strains into eight pulsotypes labeled A to H, three major pulsotypes - A to C - including the large majority of the recent sporadic S. sonnei isolates. Pulsotypes A and C were the most prevalent groups, accounting for 41.6% and 35.0%, respectively, of the isolates under study.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that biotype g, class 2 integron carrying S. sonnei are prevalent in our geographic area. S. sonnei isolated in the years 2002 and 2003 could be attributed to a few predominant clusters including, respectively, strains with pulsotypes B and C carrying a 2161 bp class 2 integron, and those having pulsotype A and a 1371 bp class 2 integron. A few epidemic clones are responsible for the apparently endemic occurrence of shigellosis in Tehran, Iran.","['Ranjbar R', 'Aleo A', 'Giammanco GM', 'Dionisi AM', 'Sadeghifard N', 'Mammina C']",2007,7,,BMC Infect Dis,"Ranjbar R, et al.

Antimicrobial drug resistance of 1814 Shigella strains isolated from Finnish patients during 1990-2005 was studied using discs of 12 antimicrobial agents. Since 2000, the E-test has been performed to determine ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations of nalidixic acid-resistant isolates. The proportion of multi-resistant strains (resistant to >or =4 antimicrobials) was highest among isolates from China and India, but is increasing significantly in other parts of Asia. Resistance to nalidixic acid has become common among the strains from the Far East, and the first isolates also resistant to ciprofloxacin were detected during 2004-2005. All the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates belonged to the S. flexneri 2a serotype. All the nalidixic acid-resistant S. flexneri strains had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, whereas 23% of the nalidixic acid-resistant S. sonnei strains were still completely susceptible to ciprofloxacin.","['Haukka K', 'Siitonen A']",2008,136,4,Epidemiol Infect,Haukka K and Siitonen A.

17571858,Preparation and characterization of translocator/chaperone complexes and their component proteins from Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri causes a severe form of bacillary dysentery also known as shigellosis. Onset of shigellosis requires bacterial invasion of colonic epithelial cells which is initiated by the delivery of translocator and effector proteins to the host cell membrane and cytoplasm, respectively, by the Shigella type III secretion system (TTSS). The Shigella translocator proteins, IpaB and IpaC, form a pore complex in the host cell membrane to facilitate effector delivery; however, prior to their secretion IpaB and IpaC are partitioned in the bacterial cytoplasm by association with the cytoplasmic chaperone IpgC. To determine their structural and biophysical properties, recombinant IpaB/IpgC and IpaC/IpgC complexes were prepared for their first detailed in vitro analysis. Both IpaB/IpgC and IpaC/IpgC complexes are highly stable and soluble heterodimers whose formation prevents IpaB-IpaC interaction as well as Ipa-dependent disruption of phospholipid membranes. Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows that IpgC binding has a detectable influence on IpaC secondary/tertiary structure and stability. In contrast, IpaB structure is not as dramatically affected by chaperone binding. To more precisely ascertain the influence of chaperone binding on IpaC structure and stability, single tryptophan mutants were generated for detailed fluorescence spectroscopy analysis. These mutants provide a low-resolution picture of how IpaC exists in the Shigella cytoplasm with chaperone binding possibly involving distinct regions within the N- and C-terminal halves of IpaC. This preliminary assessment of the IpaC-IpgC interaction is supported by initial deletion mutagenesis studies. The data provide the first structural analysis of IpgC association with IpaB and IpaC.","['Birket SE', 'Harrington AT', 'Espina M', 'Smith ND', 'Terry CM', 'Darboe N', 'Markham AP', 'Middaugh CR', 'Picking WL', 'Picking WD']",2007,46,27,Biochemistry,"Birket SE, et al.

17564043,[About combined forms of dysentery and salmonellosis].,"In Moscow, acute infectious diseases constitute more than 30% of all infectious pathology of adult population. Such combined forms as a combination of shigellosis and salmonellosis exist along with monoinfections. Addition of salmonellosis to dysentery does not necessarily worsen the course of the latter and in some cases does not express itself clinically. However, more often salmonellosis deteriorates the condition of a patient with dysentery: his/her general condition worsens, fever recommences, and defecation becomes more frequent during the recovery period. One of the characteristic forms of salmonellosis is nosoparasitism, the spread of which is not limited to infectious diseases. Nosoparasitism does not present a complication of one infection by another, but is a co-existence of two diseases, one of which as though prepares the organism for the development of the other. Combinations of different infectious diseases (syntropy) require further studies. The author adduces two own observations of the development of salmonella nosoparasitism in patients with shigellosis.

17510258,Identification of a group of shigella-like isolates as Shigella boydii 20.,"Infections by Shigella species are an important cause of diarrhoeal disease worldwide. Of 4198 Shigella isolates received by the French National Reference Centre for Escherichia coli and Shigella, 180 from patients with diarrhoea and dysentery in 2000-2004 did not react with any available polyclonal rabbit antisera used to identify the established Shigella serogroups. This study describes the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of these isolates in seroagglutination tests, molecular serotyping (rfb-RFLP and fliC-RFLP), ribotyping, detection of invasivity and enterotoxins genes, and antibiotic sensitivity. All isolates gave biochemical reactions typical of Shigella boydii, were mannitol-positive and indole-negative. They all carried invasion-associated genes, enterotoxin 2 [ShET-2] and an IS630 sequence. They had a unique ribotype that was distinct from all other Shigella and E. coli patterns. Further characterization by rfb-RFLP clearly distinguished this serogroup from all other Shigella or E. coli O-groups. The fliC-RFLP pattern corresponded to P4, an F-pattern which is associated with 10 different serogroups of S. boydii. A new antiserum prepared against strain 00-977 agglutinated all 180 isolates and cross-agglutination and absorption studies with anti-00-977 serum and anti-CDC 99-4528 (reference for the newly described S. boydii serogroup 20) serum showed identical antigenic structure. Furthermore, strains 00-977 and CDC 99-4528 had the same molecular serotype, ribotype and virulence genes.","['Grimont F', 'Lejay-Collin M', 'Talukder KA', 'Carle I', 'Issenhuth S', 'Le Roux K', 'Grimont PAD']",2007,56,Pt 6,J Med Microbiol,"Grimont F, et al.

17507120,Immunogenicity and protective efficacy offered by a ribosomal-based vaccine from Shigella flexneri 2a.,"Shigellosis is a major form of bacillary dysentery caused by Shigella infection. Shigella ribosome-based vaccines (SRV), considered among the potent vaccine candidates, are composed of O-antigen and ribosome isolated from S. flexneri 2a. To investigate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of SRV, mice were vaccinated with SRV via the intranasal (i.n.) route. Interestingly, robust levels of Shigella-derived LPS-specific IgG and IgA Abs and antibody-forming cells were elicited in systemic and mucosal compartments following two i.n. administrations of SRV. Groups of mice receiving i.n. SRV developed milder pulmonary pneumonia upon challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2a than did those receiving parenteral SRV. We further found that the MyD88-dependent TLR2 signal partially mediates SRV-induced mucosal immunity, with the exception of TLR4- and TLR5-governed innate immunity. Most importantly, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor knockout (pIgR-/-) mice, which lack secretory IgA Ab, were afforded less protective efficacy than were wild-type mice. It can be concluded then that SRV is immunogenic and provides protective efficacy in mice. It can also be surmised that a mucosal SRV vaccine would be particularly relevant in targeting shigellosis, which provokes inflammation in the human colon.","['Shim DH', 'Chang SY', 'Park SM', 'Jang H', 'Carbis R', 'Czerkinsky C', 'Uematsu S', 'Akira S', 'Kweon MN']",2007,25,25,Vaccine,"Shim DH, et al.

METHODS: The group's characteristics of dysentery were described and analysed by using descriptive study method. Drug sensitivity tests were performed with Kirby-Bauer method recommended by WHO, and data were analyzed with SPSS statistic software.
RESULTS: Average incidence rate was 222.24 /100 000 and incidence rate was high in children and in urban areas. The period of high incidence was found in July 16 to August 3. The equation of index-curve forecast model was gained as Y = e (5.816-0.5845x. It showed some value in predicting the tendency of dysentery. Shigella was sensitive to quinolones and cephalosporins, and there was no significant differences between the middle and high grade in these two kinds of antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: It should be taken as a measurement for the period of high incidence of dysentery.","['Gao T', 'Liu GR', 'Li XY', 'Jia L', 'Liu Y', 'Tang YW']",2007,41,1,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Gao T, et al.

17446289,A novel serovar of Shigella dysenteriae from patients with diarrhoea in Bangladesh.,"Every year, around 3 % of isolates from patients with diarrhoea at Dhaka Hospital, ICDDR,B, are identified as Shigella-like organisms (SLOs) based on their activity in biochemical tests. These isolates do not react with any of the current Shigella antisera including all existing and provisional serotypes. Among these SLOs, a unique cluster of seven isolates with an identical plasmid profile was found and these isolates were further characterized by phenotypic and genotypic techniques. All were nonlactose fermenters, with an identical biochemical pattern typical of Shigella dysenteriae. They were classified as invasive since they harboured the 140 MDa invasive plasmid, were able to bind Congo red, produced keratoconjunctivitis in the guinea pig eye, and were positive by PCR for the ipaH gene and Shigella enterotoxin 2 [ShET-2] gene. All isolates were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim but were susceptible to mecillinam, nalidixic acid, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. Six of the isolates were identical in DNA pattern by PFGE with the seventh exhibiting a closely related pattern; both patterns were distinguishable from all other Shigella and Escherichia coli patterns. An antiserum prepared against one of the isolates reacted with all isolates and did not cross-react with other Shigella and E. coli serotype reference strains. It is therefore proposed that these isolates represent a new provisional serovar of S. dysenteriae, type strain KIVI 162.","['Talukder KA', 'Mondol AS', 'Islam MA', 'Islam Z', 'Dutta DK', 'Khajanchi BK', 'Azmi IJ', 'Hossain MA', 'Rahman M', 'Cheasty T', 'Cravioto A', 'Nair GB', 'Sack DA']",2007,56,Pt 5,J Med Microbiol,"Talukder KA, et al.

17440606,Dipstick for rapid diagnosis of Shigella flexneri 2a in stool.,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis or bacillary dysentery, an acute bloody diarrhoea, is a major public health burden in developing countries. In the absence of prompt and appropriate treatment, the infection is often fatal, particularly in young malnourished children. Here, we describe a new diagnostic test for rapid detection, in stool, at the bedside of patients, of Shigella flexneri 2a, the most predominant agent of the endemic form of the disease.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The test is based on the detection of S.flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using serotype 2a-specific monoclonal antibodies coupled to gold particles and displayed on one-step immunochromatographic dipstick. A concentration as low as 20 ng/ml of LPS is detected in distilled water and in reconstituted stools in under 15 minutes. The threshold of detection corresponds to a concentration of 5x10(7) CFU/ml of S. flexneri 2a, which provides an unequivocal positive reaction in three minutes in distilled water and reconstituted stools. The specificity is 100% when tested with a battery of Shigella and unrelated strains, in culture. When tested in Vietnam, on clinical samples, the specificity and sensitivity were 99.2 and 91.5%, respectively. A decrease of the sensitivity during the evaluation on stool samples was observed after five weeks at room temperature and was due to moistening of the dipsticks caused by the humidity of the air during the fifth week of the evaluation. This drawback is now overcome by improving the packaging and providing dipsticks individually wrapped in waterproof bags.
CONCLUSION: This simple dipstick-bases test represents a powerful tool for case management and epidemiological surveys.","['Nato F', 'Phalipon A', 'Nguyen TL', 'Diep TT', 'Sansonetti P', 'Germani Y']",2007,2,4,PLoS One,"Nato F, et al.

17426175,Geographical distribution and risk factors associated with enteric diseases in Vietnam.,"In Vietnam, shigellosis, typhoid fever, and cholera are important enteric diseases. To determine their magnitude and geographical distribution, and explore associated risk factors, we examined national surveillance data from 1991 to 2001 and potential ecological determinants. Average annual incidence rates were calculated and mapped for each province. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were used to explore associations with selected environmental and human risk factors. Overall, shigellosis rates per 100,000 population (median, 41; mean, 70) were higher and more widespread than rates for typhoid fever (median, 7; mean, 23) and cholera (median, 0.3; mean, 2.7). Shigellosis was highest in the Central Highlands and was significantly associated with rainfall and urban poverty; typhoid fever prevailed in the Mekong River Delta and was most associated with vapor pressure and river/stream drinking water; and cholera predominated along the Central Coastal regions and correlated positively with rainfall and public well drinking water. The distinct geographical patterns of each disease appear to be driven by a combination of different ecological factors.","['Kelly-Hope LA', 'Alonso WJ', 'Thiem VD', 'Anh DD', 'Canh DG', 'Lee H', 'Smith DL', 'Miller MA']",2007,76,4,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Kelly-Hope LA, et al.

This study was aimed to investigate serum levels of vitamin A in diarrheic patients with and without HIV co-infection compared to healthy controls. Two hundred eleven diarrheic patients (110 HIV infected), 87 apparently healthy controls and 41 asymptomatic HIV seropositive blood donors who visited the University of Gondar Hospital, in Gondar, Ethiopia were included. Stool samples were examined for enteropathogens following the standard procedures. Serum vitamin A levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Shigella species were isolated from 8.5% of the patients while intestinal parasites were detected in 32.2% without significant difference by HIV serostatus. The mean+/-SD serum vitamin A in diarrheic patients with (0.82+/-0.59 micromol/L) and without (0.84+/-0.54 micromol/L) HIV co-infection and in asymptomatic HIV infected blood donors (0.96+/-0.52 micromol/L) was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (1.52+/-0.71 micromol/L), p<0.001. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD, serum retinol < 0.70 micromol/L) was observed in 52.7% and 45.5% of diarrheic patients with and without HIV co-infection, respectively. About 13% of healthy controls and 29.3% of asymptomatic HIV infected blood donors were deficient in vitamin A. The levels of serum vitamin A were not associated with the presence of intestinal parasites or Shigella species. The findings demonstrate that VAD is a severe public health problem among diarrheic patients in Gondar, Ethiopia. Intervention programmes involving health and nutrition education and supplementation of vitamin A might help in reducing morbidity in such patients.","['Kassu A', 'Andualem B', 'Van Nhien N', 'Nakamori M', 'Nishikawa T', 'Yamamoto S', 'Ota F']",2007,16 Suppl 1,,Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,"Kassu A, et al.

In the British Isles, the first exponent was Sir William Macewen (1848-1924) in Glasgow. But neuroscience had advanced in London due to the excellence of the neurologists in the several hospitals there. Foremost among English neurosurgeons was Victor Horsley whose career had a worldwide influence on the speciality. Initially, operations were carried out for cranial trauma, the removal of displaced bone or blood clot, and the drainage of abscesses arising from infection of the middle ears and air sinuses. The diagnosis of brain and spinal tumours by neurologists encouraged removal by surgeons, of which Horsley was among the earliest. Horsley performed many operations on animals, experiments opposed by the anti-vivisectionists whose campaigns Horsley countered. Horsley had many other interests, some of which displeased the establishment, and in World War I his experience in neurosurgery was not used. He served as a general surgeon, visiting Egypt, India and Mesopotamia where, in Amara, he died from hyperpyrexia complicating bacillary dysentery.",['Hughes J'],2007,15,1,J Med Biogr,Hughes J.

17339354,Shigella flexneri inhibits staurosporine-induced apoptosis in epithelial cells.,"Shigella flexneri is a facultative intracellular organism that causes bacillary dysentery. The Shigella IpaB protein activates caspase 1 in macrophages, which eventually leads to apoptosis. In contrast, epithelial cells infected with Shigella undergo a stress response but do not die. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if Shigella has the ability to inhibit apoptosis in epithelial cells. A modified gentamicin protection assay was used to investigate if HeLa cells infected with S. flexneri are able to resist the induction of apoptosis following treatment with 4 microM of staurosporine. Nuclear staining and immunofluorescence revealed that infected cells remained healthy while uninfected cells appeared apoptotic. Only uninfected cells had detectable levels of activated caspase 3 upon immunofluorescence, and this was verified by Western blot analysis. Despite interfering with caspase 3 activation, Shigella-infected cells treated with staurosporine did have cytochrome c release and caspase 9 activation, indicating that Shigella protects epithelial cells from apoptosis by inhibiting caspase 3 activation. Analysis of S. flexneri mutants showed that invasion and a functional type III secretion system were required to block apoptosis. In addition, a mutant with a deletion in mxiE, which encodes a transcriptional activator for genes induced intracellularly, failed to inhibit apoptosis. Therefore, protection of epithelial cells from apoptosis by S. flexneri is regulated by one or more of the bacterial genes under the control of mxiE. We believe that S. flexneri, like other pathogens, inhibits apoptosis in epithelial cells but causes apoptosis in macrophages to ensure survival inside the host.","['Clark CS', 'Maurelli AT']",2007,75,5,Infect Immun,Clark CS and Maurelli AT.

17305427,Yeast functional genomic screens lead to identification of a role for a bacterial effector in innate immunity regulation.,"Numerous bacterial pathogens manipulate host cell processes to promote infection and ultimately cause disease through the action of proteins that they directly inject into host cells. Identification of the targets and molecular mechanisms of action used by these bacterial effector proteins is critical to understanding pathogenesis. We have developed a systems biological approach using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can expedite the identification of cellular processes targeted by bacterial effector proteins. We systematically screened the viable yeast haploid deletion strain collection for mutants hypersensitive to expression of the Shigella type III effector OspF. Statistical data mining of the results identified several cellular processes, including cell wall biogenesis, which when impaired by a deletion caused yeast to be hypersensitive to OspF expression. Microarray experiments revealed that OspF expression resulted in reversed regulation of genes regulated by the yeast cell wall integrity pathway. The yeast cell wall integrity pathway is a highly conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, normally activated in response to cell wall perturbations. Together these results led us to hypothesize and subsequently demonstrate that OspF inhibited both yeast and mammalian MAPK signaling cascades. Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK signaling by OspF is associated with attenuation of the host innate immune response to Shigella infection in a mouse model. These studies demonstrate how yeast systems biology can facilitate functional characterization of pathogenic bacterial effector proteins.","['Kramer RW', 'Slagowski NL', 'Eze NA', 'Giddings KS', 'Morrison MF', 'Siggers KA', 'Starnbach MN', 'Lesser CF']",2007,3,2,PLoS Pathog,"Kramer RW, et al.

17291363,Seasonality in six enterically transmitted diseases and ambient temperature.,"We propose an analytical and conceptual framework for a systematic and comprehensive assessment of disease seasonality to detect changes and to quantify and compare temporal patterns. To demonstrate the proposed technique, we examined seasonal patterns of six enterically transmitted reportable diseases (EDs) in Massachusetts collected over a 10-year period (1992-2001). We quantified the timing and intensity of seasonal peaks of ED incidence and examined the synchronization in timing of these peaks with respect to ambient temperature. All EDs, except hepatitis A, exhibited well-defined seasonal patterns which clustered into two groups. The peak in daily incidence of Campylobacter and Salmonella closely followed the peak in ambient temperature with the lag of 2-14 days. Cryptosporidium, Shigella, and Giardia exhibited significant delays relative to the peak in temperature (approximately 40 days, P<0.02). The proposed approach provides a detailed quantification of seasonality that enabled us to detect significant differences in the seasonal peaks of enteric infections which would have been lost in an analysis using monthly or weekly cumulative information. This highly relevant to disease surveillance approach can be used to generate and test hypotheses related to disease seasonality and potential routes of transmission with respect to environmental factors.","['Naumova EN', 'Jagai JS', 'Matyas B', 'DeMaria A', 'MacNeill IB', 'Griffiths JK']",2007,135,2,Epidemiol Infect,"Naumova EN, et al.

17289036,Capping of actin filaments by vinculin activated by the Shigella IpaA carboxyl-terminal domain.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, invades epithelial cells. Upon bacterial-cell contact, the type III bacterial effector IpaA binds to the cytoskeletal protein vinculin to promote actin reorganization required for efficient bacterial uptake. We show that the last 74 C-terminal residues of IpaA (A559) bind to human vinculin (HV) and promotes its association with actin filaments. Polymerisation experiments demonstrated that A559 was sufficient to induce HV-dependent partial capping of the barbed ends of actin filaments. These results suggest that IpaA regulates actin polymerisation/depolymerisation at sites of Shigella invasion by modulating the barbed end capping activity of vinculin.","['Ramarao N', 'Le Clainche C', 'Izard T', 'Bourdet-Sicard R', 'Ageron E', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Carlier MF', 'Tran Van Nhieu G']",2007,581,5,FEBS Lett,"Ramarao N, et al.

17287349,O-specific [corrected] polysaccharide conjugate vaccine-induced [corrected] antibodies prevent invasion of Shigella into Caco-2 cells and may be curative.,"The O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) domain of Shigella LPS is both an essential virulence factor and a protective antigen for this genus. A critical level of serum IgG anti-O-SP was shown to confer immunity to shigellosis, likely by complement-mediated bacteriolysis of the inoculum. Conjugate Shigella O-SP vaccines were shown to be safe and immunogenic in children, and, in a preliminary study, Shigella sonnei vaccine was protective in young adults. Characteristic of shigellosis is bacterial invasion of intestinal cells. Incubation of shigellae with postimmunization but not preimmunization sera of children vaccinated with S. sonnei or Shigella flexneri 2a O-SP conjugate vaccines inhibited in a type-specific and dose-dependent manner in vitro invasion of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) and the infection-associated increases in IL-1beta and IL-8 mRNA and extracellular cytokine levels. Pretreatment of these sera or of Caco-2 cells with O-SP abrogated these effects also in a type-specific and dose-dependent manner. Confocal microscopy demonstrated antibody-specific inhibition of bacterial adhesion to HeLa cells. These protective effects were duplicated by IgG purified from these sera. These results suggest a dual role for IgG anti-O-SP. In addition to lysis of the inoculum in immune individuals, the newly synthesized IgG anti-O-SP in patients may terminate an established infection by inhibiting shigellae released from epithelial cells from invading new ones. A critical level of IgG anti-O-SP could, therefore, have a protective as well as a curative role in shigellosis.","['Chowers Y', 'Kirschner J', 'Keller N', 'Barshack I', 'Bar-Meir S', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Schneerson R', 'Robbins J', 'Passwell JH']",2007,104,7,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Chowers Y, et al.

To develop a proper animal model representing human bacillary dysentery, guinea pigs were challenged with virulent Shigella flexneri serotype 2a (strains 2457T or YSH6000) or S. flexneri 5a (strain M90T) by the intrarectal (i.r.) route. Interestingly, all guinea pigs administered these Shigella strains developed severe and acute rectocolitis. They lost approximately 20% of their body weight and developed tenesmus by 24 h after Shigella infection. Shigella invasion and colonization of the distal colon were seen at 24 h but disappeared by 48 h following i.r. infection. Histopathological approaches demonstrated significant damage and destruction of mucosal and submucosal layers, thickened intestinal wall, edema, erosion, infiltration of neutrophils, and depletion of goblet cells in the distal colon. Furthermore, robust expression of IL-8, IL-1beta, and inducible NO synthase mRNA was detected in the colon from 6 to 24 h following Shigella infection. Most importantly, in our new shigellosis model, guinea pigs vaccinated with an attenuated S. flexneri 2a SC602 strain possessing high levels of mucosal IgA Abs showed milder symptoms of bacillary dysentery than did animals receiving PBS alone after Shigella infection. In the guinea pig, administration of Shigella by i.r. route induces acute inflammation, making this animal model useful for assessing the protective efficacy of Shigella vaccine candidates.","['Shim DH', 'Suzuki T', 'Chang SY', 'Park SM', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Sasakawa C', 'Kweon MN']",2007,178,4,J Immunol,"Shim DH, et al.

However, despite this, there are very few epidemiological studies about this bacterium in Brazil. We studied the antibiotic resistance profiles and the clonal structure of 60 Shigella strains (30 S. flexneri and 30 S. sonnei) isolated from shigellosis cases in different cities within the metropolitan area of Campinas, State of São Paulo, Brazil. We used the following well-characterized molecular techniques: enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus, repetitive extragenic palindromic, and double-repetitive element-polymerase chain reaction to characterize the bacteria. Also, the antibiotic resistance of the strains was determined by the diffusion disk method. Many strains of S. flexneri and S. sonnei were found to be multi-resistant. S. flexneri strains were resistant to ampicillin in 83.3% of cases, chloramphenicol in 70.0%, streptomycin in 86.7%, sulfamethoxazole in 80.0%, and tetracycline in 80.0%, while a smaller number of strains were resistant to cephalothin (3.3%) and sulfazotrim (10.0%). S. sonnei strains were mainly resistant to sulfamethoxazole (100.0%) and tetracycline (96.7%) and, to a lesser extent, to ampicillin (6.7%) and streptomycin (26.7%). Polymerase chain reaction-based typing supported the existence of specific clones responsible for the shigellosis cases in the different cities and there was evidence of transmission between cities. This clonal structure would probably be the result of selection for virulence and resistance phenotypes. These data indicate that the human sanitary conditions of the cities investigated should be improved.","['Penatti MP', 'Hollanda LM', 'Nakazato G', 'Campos TA', 'Lancellotti M', 'Angellini M', 'Brocchi M', 'Rocha MM', 'Dias da Silveira W']",2007,40,2,Braz J Med Biol Res,"Penatti MP, et al.

The ability of a catalase test to provide rapid identification of S. dysenteriae type 1 has now been assessed, using isolates of this pathogen from five continents, Shigella of other species, and entero-invasive (EIEC) and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). All of the isolates of S. dysenteriae type 1, as well as S. dysenteriae of types 3, 4, 6, 9, 11 and 12 and S. boydii of type 12, were found catalase-negative. All the other bacteria tested were positive for catalase. In an epidemic setting in South Africa, 406 xylose-negative and lysine-decarboxylase-negative isolates, collected from xylose-lysine-deoxycholate (XLD) agar, were tested for catalase. All 356 of the catalase-negative isolates were confirmed to be of S. dysenteriae type 1. None of the catalase-positive isolates were of S. dysenteriae type 1. The catalase test is useful in the rapid, presumptive identification of S. dysenteriae type 1, from appropriate culture media, because of its high predictive value, simplicity and speed. It would be particularly useful during dysentery outbreaks, when other Shigella would be uncommon. There was no association between the absence of catalase activity and the production of Shiga toxin.","['Karas JA', 'Pillay DG', 'Sturm AW']",2007,101,1,Ann Trop Med Parasitol,"Karas JA, et al.

17239228,Using European travellers as an early alert to detect emerging pathogens in countries with limited laboratory resources.,"BACKGROUND: The volume, extent and speed of travel have dramatically increased in the past decades, providing the potential for an infectious disease to spread through the transportation network. By collecting information on the suspected place of infection, existing surveillance systems in industrialized countries may provide timely information for areas of the world without adequate surveillance currently in place. We present the results of a case study using reported cases of Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 (Sd1) in European travellers to detect ""events"" of Sd1, related to either epidemic cases or endemic cases in developing countries.
METHODS: We identified papers from a Medline search for reported events of Sd1 from 1940 to 2002. We requested data on shigella infections reported to the responsible surveillance entities in 17 European countries. Reports of Sd1 from the published literature were then compared with Sd1 notified cases among European travellers from 1990 to 2002.
RESULTS: Prior to a large epidemic in 1999-2000, no cases of Sd1 had been identified in West Africa. However, if travellers had been used as an early warning, Sd1 could have been identified in this region as earlier as 1992.
CONCLUSION: This project demonstrates that tracking diseases in European travellers could be used to detect emerging disease in developing countries. This approach should be further tested with a view to the continuous improvement of national health surveillance systems and existing European networks, and may play a significant role in aiding the international public health community to improve infectious disease control.","['Guerin PJ', 'Grais RF', 'Rottingen JA', 'Valleron AJ', 'Shigella Study Group']",2007,7,,BMC Public Health,"Guerin PJ, et al.

17217663,[Detection of class I integron and its relation to antimicrobial resistance of Shigella flexneri in children].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate class I integron of Shigella flexneri, its prevalence in children, and its relation to bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents.
METHODS: Totally 51 strains of Shigella flexneri were isolated from fecal samples of children suffering from bacterial diarrhea seen between June 2004 and November 2004 at Children's Hospital of Fudan University. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to amplify various integron markers, including intI1, gene cassette region and 3' conserved region of class I intrgron; susceptibility of Shigella flexneri strains to 7 antimicrobial agents was determined by K-B (Kriby-Bauer) method.
RESULTS: Forty-six strains of Shigella flexneri had intI gene with a positive rate of 90.2% (46/51); 24 strains of Shigella flexneri were positive for qacEDelta1-sul1, the positive rate was 47.1% (24/51); proportion of the isolates positive for all the three regions of class I integron was 43.1% (22/51); 46 strains of intI positive Shigella flexneri were all positive for ant (3'')-I. Among 46 strains of intI positive isolates, proportions of the isolates positive and negative for qacEDelta1-sul1 were 47.8% (22/46) and 52.2% (24/46), respectively. In the class I integron positive Shigella flexneri, the resistance rates of ampicillin (chi(2) = 10.13, P < 0.01) and chloramphenicol (chi(2) = 19.97, P < 0.01) were significantly higher than those in the class I integron-negative group.

17205436,Case-control study of shigellosis in San Francisco: the role of sexual transmission and HIV infection.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella species infect approximately 450,000 persons annually in the United States. Person-to-person transmission of Shigella species, which have a low infectious dose, occurs frequently, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene. Sexual transmission of Shigella species among men who have sex with men (MSM) has been inferred from outbreaks of shigellosis among that population, and limited studies have suggested the importance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as a risk factor for shigellosis. No population-based study of sporadic shigellosis has evaluated the role of sexual practices (especially among MSM) and HIV infection along with other established risk factors for shigellosis.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of shigellosis in adults in San Francisco, California, during the period 1998-1999. Cases of Shigella infection were identified through laboratory-based active surveillance conducted by the California Emerging Infections Program. Seventy-six case patients were matched by sex with 146 control subjects. Exposure data were collected on established risk factors, sexual practices, and HIV infection status. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. Population-attributable fractions were calculated.
RESULTS: From the multivariable analysis, for men, shigellosis was associated with MSM (odds ratio [OR], 8.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.70-25.2), HIV infection (OR, 8.17; 95% CI, 2.71-24.6), direct oral-anal contact (OR, 7.50; 95% CI, 1.74-32.3), and foreign travel (OR, 20.0; 95% CI, 5.26-76.3), with population-attributable fractions of 0.72, 0.42, 0.31, and 0.18, respectively. For women, shigellosis was associated only with foreign travel (OR, 21.0; 95% CI, 2.52-899), with a population-attributable fraction of 0.37.
CONCLUSIONS: Among MSM, shigellosis is predominantly a sexually transmitted disease, with direct oral-anal contact conferring the highest risk and HIV infection likely contributing to increased host susceptibility.","['Aragón TJ', 'Vugia DJ', 'Shallow S', 'Samuel MC', 'Reingold A', 'Angulo FJ', 'Bradford WZ']",2007,44,3,Clin Infect Dis,"Aragón TJ, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 39 patients with salmonellosis and 32 patients with acute shigellosis admitted to infectious hospital N 2 entered the study. The following parameters were assessed: serum concentrations of IL-1, IL-IO and TNFa; ABB, gas and electrolyte blood composition; leucocytic intoxication index (LII). The tests were made on the disease day 2-3 and 6-7 (in severe salmonellosis on day 10-11).
RESULTS: In moderate salmonellesis and acute shigellosis the level of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNFa) diminished while in severe acute intestinal infection their concentration was high reflecting imbalance of immune response. Content of IL-10 depends on etiology and severity of the course of infectious process - the highest IL-10 concentrations were found in patients with severe salmonellosis on the disease day 10-11. A direct correlation was confirmed between IL-1, TNFa and LII in the disease onset in all patients with acute intestinal infections.
CONCLUSION: An important role of IL-1, IL-10 and TNFa in pathogenesis of bacterial intestinal infections is confirmed.

These responses have been measured by evaluating antibody-secreting cells, serum antibody levels and fecal immunoglobulin A to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and to individual bacterial invasion plasmid antigens. In this review, data collected from volunteer trials with live Shigella vaccines from three different research groups are described. The attenuating features of the bacterial strains, as well as the immune response following the use of different dosing regimens, are also described. The responses obtained with each vaccine strain are compared with data obtained from challenge trials using wild-type Shigella strains. Although the exact correlates of protection have not been found, some consensus may be derived as to what may constitute a protective immune response.

Mice immunized orally or intranasally with killed S. flexneri, S. sonnei, or S. dysenteriae developed IgG and fecal IgA titers to the homologous LPS. Following respiratory challenge with the live homologous organisms, 80-100% survival was seen in all vaccinated groups compared to negligible survival in mice given PBS. Oral or intranasal immunization with an inactivated S. flexneri 2a strain (CVD1203) expressing the CFA/I and CS3 antigens of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli induced IgG responses to both heterologous antigens.

17133082,Defensins and cathelicidins in gastrointestinal infections.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recently published studies presenting novel and relevant information on antimicrobial peptides in gastrointestinal infections.
RECENT FINDINGS: Defensins and cathelicidins are important antimicrobial peptides expressed by the gastrointestinal epithelium. Their localization and regulation have been the focus of current research establishing the relevance of these peptides both in counteracting an attack by pathogens as well as in controlling the endogenous bacterial flora. In the small intestine, Paneth cell alpha-defensins maintain a low level of microorganisms and regulate the composition of the bacterial flora. In contrast, a constitutive beta-defensin can be found in nearly all gastrointestinal tissues. Other relevant beta-defensins as well as human cathelicidin are inducible by inflammation or infections. Thus Helicobacter pylori enhances defensin expression in the gastric mucosa and Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella provoke a similar response in the colon. Other pathogenic bacteria may suppress the antimicrobial peptide response as an escape strategy. Notably, the therapeutic induction of cathelicidins alleviates experimental shigellosis, suggesting a future role of endogenous antibiotics in medical therapy.
SUMMARY: These recent findings together with a better understanding of underlying mechanisms involved in the regulation and biology of antimicrobial peptides will open up new therapeutic avenues to battle infections.","['Wehkamp J', 'Schauber J', 'Stange EF']",2007,23,1,Curr Opin Gastroenterol,"Wehkamp J, et al.

17121301,Analysis of fecal leukocytes and erythrocytes in Shigella infections in urban Bangladesh.,"We evaluated the usefulness of enumeration of fecal leukocytes and erythrocytes in making an early diagnosis of Shigella infection, where Shigella is a leading cause of invasive diarrhea. Stool specimens from 561 invasive diarrhea patients were submitted for microscopic examination. A presumptive diagnosis of shigellosis based on microscopic examination was made in 389 of them; 227 had stool cultures positive for Shigella spp (Shigella patients). One hundred sixty-two patients with no detectable Shigella infection (non-Shigella invasive diarrhea cases) served as a comparison group. Two hundred twenty-seven randomly selected Shigella patients and 227 non-Shigella infectious diarrhea cases from the surveillance system database of the hospital constituted another group for comparative evaluation. The stool specimens of the patients were examined under the microscope, and isolation, biochemical characterization and serotyping of Shigella were performed. In comparison with non-Shigella invasive diarrhea cases, the presence of >50 WBC/hpf in association with any number of RBC in the fecal sample had a modest sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 59%, positive predictive value of 70%, negative predictive value of 56%, accuracy of 64%, and positive likelihood ratio of 1.6 in predicting shigellosis. Comparison between Shigella and non-Shigella infectious diarrhea patients revealed the presence of >20 WBC/hpf was a less accurate predictor of shigellosis (sensitivity 51%, specificity 88%, positive predictive value 81%, negative predictive value 64%, accuracy 69%, and positive likelihood ratio 4.1).

A total of 26 isolates of Shigella spp. were included in this study. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed high levels of resistance, especially to ampicillin, streptomycin, trimethoprim, tetracycline, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. PCR and DNA sequencing were used for screening and characterization of antibiotic-resistance determinants. PCR sequencing analysis revealed the presence of only one type of class 1 integron in one isolate of Shigella sonnei. This class 1 integron was 1904 bp and contained two gene cassettes: a probable esterase/lipase (estX) and aadA1, which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin. Two types of class 2 integron were identified in this study. One was the classic type (2158 bp) and carried the three conserved resistance gene cassettes of the class 2 integron, dfrA1, sat1 and aadA1, which confer resistance to trimethoprim, streptothricin and streptomycin/spectinomycin, respectively. This type was detected in both Shigella sonnei (14 isolates) and Shigella flexneri (five isolates). The other type was shorter (1313 bp) and carried only two gene cassettes, dfrA1 and sat1. This integron was detected in a single isolate of Shigella sonnei. PFGE patterns showed limited diversity within clusters of the same species. Furthermore, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene, bla(OXA-30), which confers resistance to ampicillin, was characterized in all isolates of Shigella flexneri except the oldest strain, which was isolated in 2000. Southern blot hybridization and conjugation experiments showed that bla(OXA-30) was located in the chromosome.","['Ahmed AM', 'Furuta K', 'Shimomura K', 'Kasama Y', 'Shimamoto T']",2006,55,Pt 12,J Med Microbiol,"Ahmed AM, et al.

17088427,Shigella applies molecular mimicry to subvert vinculin and invade host cells.,"Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, injects invasin proteins through a type III secretion apparatus upon contacting the host cell, which triggers pathogen internalization. The invasin IpaA is essential for S. flexneri pathogenesis and binds to the cytoskeletal protein vinculin to facilitate host cell entry. We report that IpaA harbors two vinculin-binding sites (VBSs) within its C-terminal domain that bind to and activate vinculin in a mutually exclusive fashion. Only the highest affinity C-terminal IpaA VBS is necessary for efficient entry and cell-cell spread of S. flexneri, whereas the lower affinity VBS appears to contribute to vinculin recruitment at entry foci of the pathogen. Finally, the crystal structures of vinculin in complex with the VBSs of IpaA reveal the mechanism by which IpaA subverts vinculin's functions, where S. flexneri utilizes a remarkable level of molecular mimicry of the talin-vinculin interaction to activate vinculin. Mimicry of vinculin's interactions may therefore be a general mechanism applied by pathogens to infect the host cell.","['Izard T', 'Tran Van Nhieu G', 'Bois PR']",2006,175,3,J Cell Biol,"Izard T, et al.

17079041,Octaplex PCR and fluorescence-based capillary electrophoresis for identification of human diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and Shigella spp.,"A multiplex PCR assay, amplifying seven specific virulence genes and one internal control gene in a single reaction, was developed to identify the five main pathotypes of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. The virulence genes selected for each category were Stx1, Stx2, and eaeA for enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), eaeA for enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), STIb and LTI for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), ipaH for enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Shigella spp., and aggR for enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). Each forward primer was labelled with a fluorochrome and the PCR products were separated by multicolour capillary electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). If present, several gene variants of each virulence gene were identified. The internal control gene rrs, encoding 16S rRNA, was amplified in all 110 clinical strains analyzed. Virulence genes were demonstrated in 103 (94%) of these strains. In the majority of the cases (98/103, 95%), classification obtained by the novel multiplex PCR assay was in agreement with that previously determined by phenotypic assays combined with other molecular genetic approaches. Numerous multiplex PCR assays have been published, but only a few of them detect all five E. coli pathotypes within a single reaction, and none of them has used multicolour capillary electrophoresis to separate the PCR products. The octaplex PCR assay followed by capillary electrophoresis presented in the present paper provides a simple, reliable, and rapid procedure that in a single reaction identifies the five main pathotypes of E. coli, and Shigella spp. This assay will replace the previous molecular genetic methods used in our laboratory and work as an important supplement to the more time-consuming phenotypic assays.","['Brandal LT', 'Lindstedt BA', 'Aas L', 'Stavnes TL', 'Lassen J', 'Kapperud G']",2007,68,2,J Microbiol Methods,"Brandal LT, et al.

METHODS: Soluble and membrane protein extractions of S. flexneri 2457T were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and immunoblotted with sera from shigellosis patients. Reactive protein spots were matched to Coomassie stained gels run in parallel, cut out and trypsin digested. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was used to determine the peptide mass fingerprints, which were searched in the MASCOT database to identify the protein.
RESULTS: A total of 8 immunoreactive proteins were successfully identified from the Coomassie stained gels in three repeats. Six of these proteins have not previously been reported as immunogenic in S. flexneri. These proteins could be potential candidates for vaccine or attenuation studies.
CONCLUSION: Soluble and membrane proteins of S. flexneri 2457T have been screened by 2-DE and immunoblotting with sera from shigellosis patients.

BACKGROUND: Renal impairment has been described during severe Salmonella infection and is mainly due to shock, dehydration, or rhabdomyolysis. However, it is unclear whether less severe Salmonella infection also has an impact on kidney function.
STUDY: We retrospectively reviewed over a 2-year period the data of all hospitalized adult patients with microbiologically proven gastrointestinal infection. Different biologic parameters were compared between patients infected with Salmonella and patients with other gastrointestinal infections.
RESULTS: One hundred and seven patients with positive stool cultures were identified; 44 of them had proven Salmonella infection. Renal dysfunction, defined as an increase in serum creatinine above 1.5 mg/dL in men and above 1.3 mg/dL in women, was observed in 16 (36%) patients infected by Salmonella but only in 3 (5%) comparators (P<0.0001). Hydration status and creatine kinase levels were not different in patients affected by Salmonella as compared with other pathogens. Kidney function recovered in all but 1 patient.

A total of 49 bacteriocinogenic S. flexneri strains were isolated from individuals of both sexes and different ages. The bacteriocins were detected by means of the drop method using E. coli and B. fragilis as target strains. The serotypes of the S. flexneri were determined. The producer capacity of bacteriocins was analysed in 10 different colonies of the same cellular clone and also the arbitrary units were determined. The highest number of bacteriocinogenic S. flexneri strains were obtained from diarrhoeal individuals from 0-10 years old and the S. flexneri serotype 2a was the most abundant. It was demonstrated that E. coli and B. fragilis isolated from the normal intestinal flora of healthy individuals were susceptible to the bacteriocinogenic S. flexneri strains. By means of the determination of arbitrary units per ml of the bacteriocin, it was demonstrated that colonies from a single colony isolate of a same clone of bacteriocinogenic S. flexneri produce different quantities of bacteriocin.","['Padilla C', 'Lobos O', 'Hubert E']",2004,46,3-4,Rev Latinoam Microbiol,"Padilla C, et al.

Globally, 1.3 billion episodes occur annually, with an average of 2-3 episodes per child per year. The important aetiologic agents of diarrhoea and the guidelines for management are discussed. Management of acute diarrhoea is entirely based on clinical presentation of the cases. It includes assessment of the degree of dehydration clinically, rehydration therapy, feeding during diarrhoea, use of antibiotic(s) in selected cases, micronutrient supplementation and use of probiotics. Assessment of the degree of dehydration should be done following the WHO guidelines. Dehydration can be managed with oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution or intravenous fluids. Recently WHO has recommended a hypo-osmolar ORS solution for the treatment of all cases of acute diarrhoea including cholera. Feeding during and after diarrhoea (for at least 2-3 weeks) prevents malnutrition and growth retardation. Antibiotic therapy is not recommended for the treatmentof diarrhoea routinely. Only cases of severe cholera and bloody diarrhoea (presumably shigellosis) should be treated with a suitable antibiotic. Pilot studies in several countries have shown that zinc supplementation during diarrhoea reduces the severity and duration of the disease as well as antidiarrhoeal and antimicrobial use rate. Probiotics may offer a safe intervention in acute infectious diarrhoea to reduce the duration and severity of the illness.","['Sur D', 'Bhattacharya SK']",2006,104,5,J Indian Med Assoc,Sur D and Bhattacharya SK.

17035783,Host responses to secreted Shigella virulence factors.,"Shigella and related enteropathogens deliver effector molecules into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells and macrophages via a type III secretion system. Epithelial cells respond to contact with Shigella by rearranging the cytoskeleton, which leads to uptake of the bacterium. Apart from several cytoskeletal proteins, this process involves the recruitment and activation of kinases, and the small GTPase rho. Macrophages infected with Shigella undergo apoptosis and release mature IL-1beta, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. This apoptotic pathway requires caspase-1 (IL-1beta-converting enzyme).

Evidence is mounting that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be safely used to treat serious infections in children. Cefixime showed some promise in treating shigellosis in an open labeled trial. Decreased gastric acid secretion was associated with cholera but not dysentery. Phase 1 trials of vaccines for cholera and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli showed promise.

16997593,Risk factors for shigellosis in Thailand.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential risk factors for shigellosis including housefly density.
METHODS: A matched case-control study to investigate potential risk factors for shigellosis was conducted in a semi-urban area, Kaengkhoi District, Saraburi Province, central Thailand. Shigella cases were ascertained from a two-year population-based surveillance study detecting diarrhea and shigellosis in the area. The study evaluated a wide range of exposures, which were assessed by odds ratios (OR) adjusted for proxy markers of socioeconomic status: family income, and type of residence, using conditional logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Hygiene behaviors such as regular hand washing (p<0.05), a clean environment surrounding the household (p<0.001), and the availability of water to flush the toilet (p=0.08) were associated with a reduced risk for shigellosis in the multivariate model. In contrast factors indicating a lower than average socioeconomic status, such as having to rent instead of owning one's housing (p<0.001) and a low family income (p<0.01) were associated with an increased risk for shigellosis. For children, breastfeeding showed a strong protective effect in reducing the risk of shigellosis (p<0.01). Prior to adjustment for environmental factors, fly density in the kitchen area was associated with an increased risk of shigellosis (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a correlation between socioeconomic status and the risk for shigellosis. To reduce shigellosis in this setting, we recommend interventions focused on three aspects: improved water supply and sanitation (especially latrines and garbage disposal) including fly control, health education on hand washing, and the promotion of breastfeeding.","['Chompook P', 'Todd J', 'Wheeler JG', 'von Seidlein L', 'Clemens J', 'Chaicumpa W']",2006,10,6,Int J Infect Dis,"Chompook P, et al.

16988276,OspF and OspC1 are Shigella flexneri type III secretion system effectors that are required for postinvasion aspects of virulence.,"Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of dysentery, and its pathogenesis is mediated by a type III secretion system (T3SS). S. flexneri secretes effector proteins into the eukaryotic cell via the T3SS, and these proteins usurp host cellular functions to the benefit of the bacteria. OspF and OspC1 are known to be secreted by S. flexneri, but their functions are unknown. We transformed S. flexneri with a plasmid that expresses a two-hemagglutinin tag (2HA) in frame with OspF or OspC1 and verified that these proteins are secreted in a T3SS-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence of HeLa cells infected with S. flexneri expressing OspF-2HA or OspC1-2HA revealed that both proteins localize in the nucleus and cytoplasm of host cells. To elucidate the function of these T3SS effectors, we constructed DeltaospF and DeltaospC1 deletion mutants by allelic exchange. We found that DeltaospF and DeltaospC1 mutants invade host cells and form plaques in confluent monolayers similar to wild-type S. flexneri. However, in the polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell migration assay, a decrease in neutrophil migration was observed for both mutants in comparison to the migration of wild-type bacteria. Moreover, infection of polarized T84 intestinal cells infected with DeltaospF and DeltaospC1 mutants resulted in decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in comparison to that of T84 cells infected with wild-type S. flexneri. To date, these are the first examples of T3SS effectors implicated in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activation. Ultimately, OspF and OspC1 are essential for PMN transepithelial migration, a phenotype associated with increased inflammation and bacterial access to the submucosa, which are fundamental aspects of S. flexneri pathogenesis.","['Zurawski DV', 'Mitsuhata C', 'Mumy KL', 'McCormick BA', 'Maurelli AT']",2006,74,10,Infect Immun,"Zurawski DV, et al.

16982910,High vaccine efficacy against shigellosis of recombinant noninvasive Shigella mutant that expresses Yersinia invasin.,"Live attenuated Shigella vaccines elicit protective immune responses, but involve a potential risk of inducing a strong inflammatory reaction. The bacterial invasiveness that is crucial for Ag delivery causes inflammatory destruction of infected epithelial cells and proinflammatory cell death of infected macrophages. In this study, the noninvasive Shigella mutant DeltaipaB was equipped with Yersinia invasin protein, which has been shown to mediate bacterial invasion and targeting to M cells located in follicle-associated epithelium. Invasin-expressing DeltaipaB (DeltaipaB/inv) was internalized into epithelial cells and retained in the intraphagosomal space. DeltaipaB/inv did not induce necrotic cell death of infected macrophages nor cause symptomatic damage after intranasal vaccination of mice. DeltaipaB/inv was safer and more effective than the conventional live vaccine, DeltavirG. Infection by DeltaipaB/inv caused polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration in the lung, but did not induce production of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. We concluded that the low experimental morbidity and high vaccine efficacy of DeltaipaB/inv are primarily based on high protective immune responses, which may be enhanced by the polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration unaccompanied by tissue injury.","['Suzuki T', 'Yoshikawa Y', 'Ashida H', 'Iwai H', 'Toyotome T', 'Matsui H', 'Sasakawa C']",2006,177,7,J Immunol,"Suzuki T, et al.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Resistance to sunlight at 37 degrees C based on F99 values was in the following order: Salmonella Typhimurium>Escherichia coli>Shigella flexneri>Vibrio cholerae. While F90 values of Salm. Typhimurium and E. coli were similar, F99 values differed by 60% due to different inactivation curve shapes. Efficacy seemed not to be dependent on fluence rate for E. coli stationary cells. Sensitivity to mild heat was observed above a temperature of 45 degrees C for E. coli, Salm. Typhimurium and Sh. flexneri, while V. cholerae was already susceptible above 40 degrees C.
CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella Typhimurium was the most resistant and V. cholerae the least resistant enteric strain. The reciprocity law is applicable for stationary E. coli cells irradiated with sunlight or artificial sunlight.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Escherichia coli might not be the appropriate indicator bacterium to test the efficacy of SODIS on enteric bacteria and the physiological response to SODIS might be different among enteric bacteria. The applicability of the reciprocity law indicates that fluence rate plays a secondary role in SODIS efficacy. Stating inactivation efficacy with T90 or F90 values without showing original data is inadequate for SODIS studies.","['Berney M', 'Weilenmann HU', 'Simonetti A', 'Egli T']",2006,101,4,J Appl Microbiol,"Berney M, et al.

16968124,"A multicentre study of Shigella diarrhoea in six Asian countries: disease burden, clinical manifestations, and microbiology.","BACKGROUND: The burden of shigellosis is greatest in resource-poor countries. Although this diarrheal disease has been thought to cause considerable morbidity and mortality in excess of 1,000,000 deaths globally per year, little recent data are available to guide intervention strategies in Asia. We conducted a prospective, population-based study in six Asian countries to gain a better understanding of the current disease burden, clinical manifestations, and microbiology of shigellosis in Asia.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Over 600,000 persons of all ages residing in Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand were included in the surveillance. Shigella was isolated from 2,927 (5%) of 56,958 diarrhoea episodes detected between 2000 and 2004. The overall incidence of treated shigellosis was 2.1 episodes per 1,000 residents per year in all ages and 13.2/1,000/y in children under 60 months old. Shigellosis incidence increased after age 40 years. S. flexneri was the most frequently isolated Shigella species (1,976/2,927 [68%]) in all sites except in Thailand, where S. sonnei was most frequently detected (124/146 [85%]). S. flexneri serotypes were highly heterogeneous in their distribution from site to site, and even from year to year. PCR detected ipaH, the gene encoding invasion plasmid antigen H in 33% of a sample of culture-negative stool specimens. The majority of S. flexneri isolates in each site were resistant to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. Ciprofloxacin-resistant S. flexneri isolates were identified in China (18/305 [6%]), Pakistan (8/242 [3%]), and Vietnam (5/282 [2%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Shigella appears to be more ubiquitous in Asian impoverished populations than previously thought, and antibiotic-resistant strains of different species and serotypes have emerged. Focusing on prevention of shigellosis could exert an immediate benefit first by substantially reducing the overall diarrhoea burden in the region and second by preventing the spread of panresistant Shigella strains. The heterogeneous distribution of Shigella species and serotypes suggest that multivalent or cross-protective Shigella vaccines will be needed to prevent shigellosis in Asia.","['von Seidlein L', 'Kim DR', 'Ali M', 'Lee H', 'Wang X', 'Thiem VD', 'Canh DG', 'Chaicumpa W', 'Agtini MD', 'Hossain A', 'Bhutta ZA', 'Mason C', 'Sethabutr O', 'Talukder K', 'Nair GB', 'Deen JL', 'Kotloff K', 'Clemens J']",2006,3,9,PLoS Med,"von Seidlein L, et al.

16954064,Shigella as a foodborne pathogen and current methods for detection in food.,"Shigella, the causative agent of shigellosis or ""bacillary dysentery,"" has been increasingly involved in foodborne outbreaks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program, Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), Shigella was the third most reported foodborne bacterial pathogen in 2002. Foods are most commonly contaminated with Shigella by an infected food handler who practices poor personal hygiene. Shigella is acid resistant, salt tolerant, and can survive at infective levels in many types of foods such as fruits and vegetables, low pH foods, prepared foods, and foods held in modified atmosphere or vacuum packaging. Survival is often increased when food is held at refrigerated temperatures. Detection methods for Shigella include conventional culture methods, immunological methods, and molecular microbiological methods. Conventional culture of Shigella in foods is often problematic due to the lack of appropriate selective media. Immunological methods for Shigella have been researched, yet there is only one commercially available test kit. Molecular microbiological methods such as PCR, oligonucleotide microarrays, and rep-PCR have also been developed for the detection and identification of Shigella. This manuscript reviews the general characteristics, prevalence, growth and survival, and methods for detection of Shigella in food.","['Warren BR', 'Parish ME', 'Schneider KR']",2006,46,7,Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,"Warren BR, et al.

20353132,Antimicrobial resistence of Shigella species isolated during 2004 and 2005 from selected sites in Zimbabwe.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the predominant serotype and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of Shigella isolates during 2004 and 2005 in Zimbabwe.
DESIGN: Cross sectional study.
SETTING: National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (NMRL), Harare, Zimbabwe.
SAMPLE: 259 clinical isolates of Shigella species isolated during 2004 and 2005 in Zimbabwe were studied. These samples had been referred to the NMRL for further testing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serotype and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of Shigella species.
RESULTS: Of the 259 clinical isolates of Shigella tested the following species were serotyped; 141 (54.4%) were S. flexneri; 70 (27%) S. sonnei; 38 (14.7%) S. dysenteriae and 10 (3.9%) S. boydii. About 4% of all Shigella isolates tested showed full sensitivity to commonly used antibiotics, 20.8% were resistant to one antibiotic only while 75.3% were resistant to at least two antibiotics. The most common resistance among Shigella species was to cotrimoxazole (89%), tetracycline (73%), ampicillin (49%) and chloramphenicol (41%). High susceptibility among Shigella species was observed to nalidixic acid (86%), ciprofloxacin (99%) and ceftazidine (99%).
CONCLUSION: There was a low drug resistance of Shigella species to nalidixic acid, a drug of choice in Zimbabwe, except among Shigella dysenteriae type 1 strains. Continuous monitoring of the susceptibility patterns of Shigella species is important in order to detect the emergence of drug resistance and to update guidelines for antibiotic treatment in shigellosis.","['Ndlovu N', 'Tarupiwa A', 'Mudzori JT']",2006,52,9-12,Cent Afr J Med,"Ndlovu N, et al.

16936364,Current status of anti-diarrheal and anti-secretory drugs in the management of acute childhood diarrhea.,"Each year 1.8 million children die due to diarrheal diseases. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics has resulted in increasing resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Moreover the recent outbreaks of shigella and cholera have revealed multi-drug resistance strains. There is a need for review of recommended antibiotics for shigellosis. From recent data it emerges that fluoroquinolones should be the first line of therapy and cephalosporins to be used as the second line. Among the anti-cholera antibiotics, tetracyclines which were the drug of choice for adults, has the advantage of high sensitivity and low cost. Single dose doxycycline would have minimal side effects, hence can be the drug of choice even in children. We should not allow the business pressures to force usage of probiotics and racecadotril as their role in the management of acute diarrhea is yet to be established. Nitazoxanide has high efficacy against Cryptosporodial diarrhea only. Strict adherence to the recommendations for the management of acute childhood diarrhea is needed or else we dilute the effect of standard management.","['Alam S', 'Bhatnagar S']",2006,73,8,Indian J Pediatr,Alam S and Bhatnagar S.

16925787,Cholesterol is required to trigger caspase-1 activation and macrophage apoptosis after phagosomal escape of Shigella.,"Pro-inflammatory macrophage apoptosis is pivotal in the aetiology of bacillary dysentery, an acute inflammatory diarrhoea caused by Shigella spp. S. flexneri triggers its uptake by macrophages, escapes the phagosome and kills the host cell by a cytotoxic pathway, which activates and requires caspase-1 [interleukin (IL)-1beta-converting enzyme] and releases mature IL-1beta. The bacterial type III-secreted translocator/effector protein IpaB triggers cell death and directly binds to caspase-1. Here, we demonstrate that in S. flexneri-infected macrophages, activated caspase-1 is present in the cytoplasm, the nucleus and on vesicular membranes. IpaB partitions with membrane and cytoplasmic fractions and colocalizes with activated caspase-1 on the surface of bacteria, in the macrophage cytoplasm and on vesicular membranes. Macrophages treated with the cholesterol-sequestering compound methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD) were depleted from cholesterol within minutes and were impaired for phagocytosis of S. flexneri. Consequently, cytotoxicity as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release was blocked. Interestingly, if MCD was added 15-30 min post infection, cytotoxicity, activation of caspase-1, and apoptosis were inhibited, while phagocytosis of the bacteria, escape from the phagosome and type III secretion of IpaB was not affected. Inhibition of Shigella cytotoxicity by MCD coincided with a reduced association of IpaB to host cell membranes. Contrarily, the activation of caspase-1 and cytotoxicity triggered by the K+/H+ antiport ionophore nigericin or by ATP was not affected or even increased by MCD. These results indicate that cholesterol is specifically required for caspase-1 activation and apoptosis triggered by Shigella after the escape from phagosomes, and suggest that membrane association of IpaB contributes to the activation of caspase-1.","['Schroeder GN', 'Hilbi H']",2007,9,1,Cell Microbiol,Schroeder GN and Hilbi H.

16914657,Antibiotic resistance and genetic diversity of Shigella sonnei isolated from patients with diarrhoea between 1999 and 2003 in Bangladesh.,"Shigella sonnei is a significant cause of diarrhoeal infection in both developing and industrialized countries. From 1999 to 2003, 445 strains of Shigella sonnei were isolated from patients admitted to the diarrhoea treatment centre of the International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. More than 60% of the isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, 89% to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and 9.5% to ampicillin. In addition, 4% of strains were resistant to multiple antibiotics (AmpR TetR SxtR StrR) and 4.2% of strains were sensitive to all antibiotics tested. None of the strains were positive for the set1 gene, whereas 46% were positive for the sen gene. Forty-six per cent of the strains (stored at -70 degrees C) harboured the 120 MDa invasive plasmid and representative strains produced keratoconjunctivitis in the guinea pig eye. In addition, three plasmids of approximately 5, 1.8 and 1.4 MDa were found to be present in more than 90% of the strains. A self-transmissible, middle-ranged plasmid (35-80 MDa) carrying the multiple antibiotic resistance gene was found in some strains. PFGE analysis of the strains identified five unique types with many subtypes, which were characterized into four unique types by ribotyping analysis. It can be concluded that endemic strains of Shigella sonnei isolated from patients in Bangladesh are diverse in their genetic pattern.","['Talukder KA', 'Islam Z', 'Dutta DK', 'Islam MA', 'Khajanchi BK', 'Azmi IJ', 'Iqbal MS', 'Hossain MA', 'Faruque ASG', 'Nair GB', 'Sack DA']",2006,55,Pt 9,J Med Microbiol,"Talukder KA, et al.

Such events require a rapid response and incorporation of non-traditional partners for disease investigation and outbreak control. The astute application of infectious disease epidemiological principles can promote an enhanced index of suspicion for such events. We discuss epidemiological indicators that should be considered during outbreak investigations, and also examine their application during bioterrorism incidents, an accidental release of an agent, outbreaks of infections that were alleged to have been deliberately initiated, and a model scenario. The Grunow & Finke epidemiological assessment tool is used to examine these historical events and the model scenario. The results received from this analysis, coupled with an understanding of epidemiological clues to unnatural events, and knowledge of how to manage such events, can aid in the improved response and resolution of epidemics.","['Dembek ZF', 'Kortepeter MG', 'Pavlin JA']",2007,135,3,Epidemiol Infect,"Dembek ZF, et al.

16891506,Characterization of Shigella strains in Iran by plasmid profile analysis and PCR amplification of ipa genes.,"To characterize Shigella clinical strains, we studied 82 Shigella strains recovered from 719 stool samples of patients with bloody diarrhea in Shiraz, Iran, over the period from April to October 2003. Serological assay classified the Shigella isolates as follows: 61 (74.39%) Shigella sonnei isolates, 16 (19.51%) Shigella flexneri isolates, 3 (3.65%) Shigella boydii isolates, and 2 (2.43%) Shigella dysenteriae isolates. In an antibiogram test, all Shigella strains were susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. They showed high degrees of sensitivity to nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cephalothin, and amikacin. Approximately 90.24% of the Shigella isolates were resistant to co-trimoxazole. The plasmid profile patterns of all strains were determined by a modified alkaline lysis method. The average number of plasmid bands for each strain was 9.5. By plasmid profile analysis we identified 56 genotypes among all isolates and 42, 14, 3, and 2 genotypes among the S. sonnei, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. dysenteriae strains, respectively. PCR assays showed that all isolates were positive for two virulence genes, ipaBCD and ipaH. In conclusion, these data mandate local monitoring of drug resistance and its consideration in the empirical therapy of Shigella infections. These results also demonstrate that plasmid profile analysis is more reliable than antibiotic susceptibility pattern analysis for the identification of Shigella epidemic strains isolated in Iran.","['Farshad S', 'Sheikhi R', 'Japoni A', 'Basiri E', 'Alborzi A']",2006,44,8,J Clin Microbiol,"Farshad S, et al.

We used different proteolytic enzymes to selectively shave the protruding proteins on the surface of purified bacterial membrane sheets or vesicles, and recovered peptides were subsequently identified using 2-D LC-MS/MS. As a result, a total of 666 proteins were unambiguously assigned, including 159 integral membrane proteins, 35 outer membrane proteins and 114 proteins previously annotated as hypothetical. The former had an average grand average hydrophobicity score of 0.362 and were predicted to separate within a pH range of 4.1-10.6 with molecular mass 8-148 kDa, which represents the largest validated set of integral membrane proteins in this organism to date. A functional classification revealed that a large proportion of the identified proteins were involved in cell envelope biogenesis and energy production and conversion.

16883444,"Increasing single and multi-antibiotic resistance in Shigella species isolated from shigellosis patients in Sana'a, Yemen.","OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of Shigella species changes over time. Updated susceptibility knowledge is necessary for appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment. Thus, this research aimed to study these changes in 2 time periods with an interval of 10 years.
METHODS: Two hundreds and three Shigella strains, isolated from stool samples of diarrheic patients at the Central Health Laboratory in Sana'a, Yemen in 2 time periods (1993 and 2003) with a 10-year interval, were examined for serotyping and drug resistance pattern. Resistance patterns of the strains to 12 commonly used antimicrobial agents and minimum inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics were tested.
RESULTS: Shigella flexneri (60%) was found to be the most common isolate of the total Shigella species, followed by Shigella dysenteriae (28.6%) and Shigella boydii (11.3%). In Shigella flexneri strains, Shigella flexneri 3 (30.5%) was the most prevalent serotype, followed by Shigella flexneri 6 (17.2%), and Shigella flexneri 1 (12.3%). All strains were found equally susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, but more than 80% of the strains of 2003 were resistant to tetracycline, co-trimoxazole, and 52% of the same strains were resistant to ampicillin. Resistance to chloramphenicol was found in 61%, cefuroxime in 56.2%, and cephradine, 52% of the strains. Overall, Shigella species showed statistically significant increase in resistance against tetracycline, cephradine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, and aztreonam (p<0.05) over the 10 years period. This indicates decreased efficacy of co-trimoxazole and nalidixic acid for the empirical treatment of shigellosis in Sana'a, Yemen. Almost 55.2% of the strains were resistant to 4 drugs.
CONCLUSION: This is one of the first studies reporting epidemiological pattern of Shigella species in Sana'a, Yemen with regard to serotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns. Based on these antibiotic resistance pattern findings, it is suggested that the commonly in use antibiotics including ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol should not be used for empirical treatment of shigellosis in Yemen.","['Al-Moyed KA', 'Harmal NS', 'Al-Harasy AH', 'Al-Shamahy HA']",2006,27,8,Saudi Med J,"Al-Moyed KA, et al.

16878230,Trend and disease burden of bacillary dysentery in China (1991-2000).,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the burden of bacillary dysentery in China, its cross-regional variations, trends in morbidity and mortality, the causative bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance patterns.
METHODS: We extracted and integrated governmental statistics and relevant medical literature published from 1991 to 2000. Data were also collected from one general hospital each for the six provinces and Jin-an district, Shanghai, representative of six geographical regions and a modern city.
FINDINGS: In 2000, 0.8-1.7 million episodes of bacillary dysentery occurred of which 0.5 to 0.7 million were treated at health-care facilities and 0.15-0.20 million patients were hospitalized. The highest morbidity and mortality rates were among the youngest and oldest age groups. Bacillary dysentery peaked during the summer months. The major causative species was Shigella flexneri (86%) and the predominant S. flexneri serotype was 2a (80%). About 74-80% of Shigella isolates remained susceptible to fluorinated quinolones.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that while morbidity and mortality due to bacillary dysentery has decreased considerably in China in the past decade due to increasing access to affordable health care and antibiotics, a considerable burden exists among the youngest and oldest age groups and in regions with low economic development. We suggest that while a vaccine would be effective for short- and medium-term control of bacillary dysentery, improved water supply, sanitation, and hygiene are likely to be required for long-term control.","['Wang XY', 'Tao F', 'Xiao D', 'Lee H', 'Deen J', 'Gong J', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou W', 'Li W', 'Shen B', 'Song Y', 'Ma J', 'Li ZM', 'Wang Z', 'Su PY', 'Chang N', 'Xu JH', 'Ouyang PY', 'von Seidlein L', 'Xu ZY', 'Clemens JD']",2006,84,7,Bull World Health Organ,"Wang XY, et al.

The highest rates of antimicrobial resistance were to trimethoprim-sulfamethozaxole (90%), tetracycline (88%), ampicillin (56%), and chloramphenicol (35%).

16861624,IpaD localizes to the tip of the type III secretion system needle of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of shigellosis, is a gram-negative bacterial pathogen that initiates infection by invading cells within the colonic epithelium. Contact with host cell surfaces induces a rapid burst of protein secretion via the Shigella type III secretion system (TTSS). The first proteins secreted are IpaD, IpaB, and IpaC, with IpaB and IpaC being inserted into the host cell membrane to form a pore for translocating late effectors into the target cell cytoplasm. The resulting pathogen-host cross talk results in localized actin polymerization, membrane ruffling, and, ultimately, pathogen entry. IpaD is essential for host cell invasion, but its role in this process is just now coming to light. IpaD is a multifunctional protein that controls the secretion and presentation of IpaB and IpaC at the pathogen-host interface. We show here that antibodies recognizing the surface-exposed N terminus of IpaD neutralize Shigella's ability to promote pore formation in erythrocyte membranes. We further show that MxiH and IpaD colocalize on the bacterial surface. When TTSS needles were sheared from the Shigella surface, IpaD was found at only the needle tips. Consistent with this, IpaD localized to the exposed tips of needles that were still attached to the bacterium. Molecular analyses then showed that the IpaD C terminus is required for this surface localization and function. Furthermore, mutations that prevent IpaD surface localization also eliminate all IpaD-related functions. Thus, this study demonstrates that IpaD localizes to the TTSA needle tip, where it functions to control the secretion and proper insertion of translocators into host cell membranes.","['Espina M', 'Olive AJ', 'Kenjale R', 'Moore DS', 'Ausar SF', 'Kaminski RW', 'Oaks EV', 'Middaugh CR', 'Picking WD', 'Picking WL']",2006,74,8,Infect Immun,"Espina M, et al.

Shigella sonnei is the serogroup of Shigella most frequently responsible for sporadic and epidemic enteritis in developed countries. The dissemination is associated most often to human to human transmission, but foodborne episodes have also been described. In recent years the circulation of multiresistant strains of S. sonnei biotype g carrying a class 2 integron has been reported in many countries worldwide. In southern Italy a strain with similar properties has been responsible for a large community outbreak occurred in 2003 in Palermo, Sicily. The objective of this study was to date the emergence of the biotype g strain carrying the class 2 integron in southern Italy and to evaluate the genetic heterogeneity of biotype g S. sonnei isolated throughout an extended interval of time.
METHODS: A total of 31 clinical isolates of S. sonnei biotype g identified in southern Italy during the years 1971-2000 were studied. The strains were identified at the serogroup level, characterized by biochemical tests and submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Molecular typing was performed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after digestion of DNA by XbaI. Carriage of class 2 integrons was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers and confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis of amplicons.
RESULTS: The 15 isolates of S. sonnei biotype g identified in the decade 1971-1980 showed highly heterogeneous drug resistance profiles and pulsotypes. None of the isolates was simultaneous resistant to streptomycin and trimethoprim and none was class 2 integron positive. On the contrary, this resistance phenotype and class 2 integron carriage were very common among the 16 strains of biotype g identified in the following two decades. Moreover, all the more recent isolates, but one, showed closely related pulsotypes.
CONCLUSION: Although our findings refer to a limited geographic area, they provide a snapshot of integron acquisition by an enteric pathogen responsible for several outbreaks in the years 2001-2003 in Italy. Molecular typing, indeed, suggests that the emergence of biotype g class 2 integron carrying S. sonnei in southern Italy should be backdated to at least the late 1980s. In the following decades, the circulation of biotype g appears to be sustained by multiresistant highly related strains. Similar trend are described in several countries, but the questions about mechanism of emergence and worldwide spread of this pathogen remain open.","['Mammina C', 'Aleo A', 'Romani C', 'Nastasi A']",2006,6,,BMC Infect Dis,"Mammina C, et al.

16834612,Inactivation of Escherichia coli and Shigella in acidic fruit and vegetable juices by peroxidase systems.,"AIMS: To study the bactericidal properties of the lactoperoxidase (LPER)-thiocyanate and soybean peroxidase (SBP)-thiocyanate systems at low pH, their efficiency for inactivation of Escherichia coli and Shigella in acidic fruit and vegetable juices, their effect on colour stability of the juices and interaction with ascorbic acid.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Three-strain cocktails of E. coli and Shigella spp. in selected juices were supplemented with the LPER or SBP system. Within 24 h at 20 degrees C, the LPER system inactivated both cocktails by > or = 5 log10 units in apple, 2-5 log10 units in orange and < or = 1 log10 unit in tomato juices. In the presence of SBP, browning was significant in apple juice and white grape juice, slight in pink grape juice and absent in orange or tomato juice. Ascorbic acid protected E. coli and Shigella against inactivation by the LPER system, and peroxidase systems significantly reduced the ascorbic acid content of juices.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a different specificity of LPER and SBP for SCN-, phenolic substrates of browning and ascorbic acid in acidic juices. The LPER system appeared a more appropriate candidate than the SBP system for biopreservation of juices.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work may open perspectives towards the development of LPER or other peroxidases as biopreservatives in acidic foods.","['Van Opstal I', 'Bagamboula CF', 'Theys T', 'Vanmuysen SC', 'Michiels CW']",2006,101,1,J Appl Microbiol,"Van Opstal I, et al.

16820504,The Caenorhabditis elegans ABL-1 tyrosine kinase is required for Shigella flexneri pathogenesis.,"Shigellosis is a diarrheal disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Shigella flexneri. Following ingestion of the bacterium, S. flexneri interferes with innate immunity, establishes an infection within the human colon, and initiates an inflammatory response that results in destruction of the tissue lining the gut. Examination of host cell factors required for S. flexneri pathogenesis in vivo has proven difficult due to limited host susceptibility. Here we report the development of a pathogenesis system that involves the use of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study S. flexneri virulence determinants and host molecules required for pathogenesis. We show that S. flexneri-mediated killing of C. elegans correlates with bacterial accumulation in the intestinal tract of the animal. The S. flexneri virulence plasmid, which encodes a type III secretory system as well as various virulence determinants crucial for pathogenesis in mammalian systems, was found to be required for maximal C. elegans killing. Additionally, we demonstrate that ABL-1, the C. elegans homolog of the mammalian c-Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase ABL1, is required for S. flexneri pathogenesis in nematodes. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using C. elegans to study S. flexneri pathogenesis in vivo and provide insight into host factors that contribute to S. flexneri pathogenesis.","['Burton EA', 'Pendergast AM', 'Aballay A']",2006,72,7,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Burton EA, et al.

16819373,The diagnostic value of serum interleukins 6 and 8 in children with acute gastroenteritis.,"OBJECTIVES: Early identification of the pathogen causing acute gastroenteritis in children helps the physicians managing the disease and prevents unnecessary antibiotic treatment. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-8 play a major role in immune responses and have been studied in a large number of infectious and noninfectious inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine the serum IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations early in the course of acute gastroenteritis to see if these cytokines were useful diagnostic markers in differentiating viral from bacterial gastroenteritis.
METHODS: Interleukin 6, IL-8 and CRP were measured in 18 patients with bacterial gastroenteritis, 21 patients with viral gastroenteritis and 17 healthy children.
RESULTS: Interleukin 6 and CRP concentrations in patients with bacterial gastroenteritis were significantly higher than those in patients with viral gastroenteritis and healthy controls (P < 0.001). IL-8 concentrations in patients with viral and bacterial gastroenteritis were both increased and were not statistically different. IL-6 and IL-8 levels had diagnostic sensitivities of 79% and 50% and specificities of 86% and 67%, respectively. The combination of IL-6 and CRP had a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 71%, a positive predictive value of 74% and a negative predictive value of 93.75%.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-6 may be a useful marker for early differentiation of viral and bacterial gastroenteritis in children, especially in combination with CRP.","['Lin CH', 'Hsieh CC', 'Chen SJ', 'Wu TC', 'Chung RL', 'Tang RB']",2006,43,1,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Lin CH, et al.

16804978,Interaction between enteric epithelial cells and Peyer's patch lymphocytes in response to Shigella lipopolysaccharide: effect on nitric oxide and IL-6 release.,"AIM: To investigate the effect of interaction between enteric epithelial cells and lymphocytes of Peyer's patch on the release of nitric oxide (NO) and IL-6 in response to Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
METHODS: Human colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2) were mixed cocultured with lymphocytes of Peyer's patch from wild-type (C57 mice) and inducible NO synthase knockout mice, and challenged with Shigella F2a-12 LPS. Release of NO and mIL-6 was measured by Griess colorimetric assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.
RESULTS: In the absence of LPS challenge, NO was detected in the culture medium of Caco-2 epithelial cells but not in lymphocytes of Peyer's patch, and the NO release was further up-regulated in both cocultures with lymphocytes from either the wild-type or iNOS knockout mice, with a significantly higher level observed in the coculture with iNOS knockout lymphocytes. After Shigella F2a-12 LPS challenge for 24-h, NO production was significantly increased in both Caco-2 alone and the coculture with lymphocytes of Peyer's patch from the wild-type mice but not from iNOS knockout mice. LPS was found to stimulate the release of mIL-6 from lymphocytes, which was suppressed by coculture with Caco-2 epithelial cells. The LPS-induced mIL-6 production in lymphocytes from iNOS knockout mice was significantly greater than that from the wild-type mice.
CONCLUSION: Lymphocytes of Peyer's patch maintain a constitutive basal level of NO production from the enteric epithelial cell Caco-2. LPS-induced mIL-6 release from lymphocytes of Peyer's patch is suppressed by the cocultured epithelial cells. While no changes are detectable in NO production in lymphocytes from both wild-type and iNOS knockout mice before and after LPS challenge, NO from lymphocytes appears to play an inhibitory role in epithelial NO release and their own mIL-6 release in response to LPS.","['Chen J', 'Ng CP', 'Rowlands DK', 'Xu PH', 'Gao JY', 'Chung YW', 'Chan HC']",2006,12,24,World J Gastroenterol,"Chen J, et al.

16775951,[Antibiotic resistance rates of Shigella species isolated from stool cultures in the years 1999-2003].,"In this study, species distribution, seasonal isolation rates and antibiotic susceptibilitiy patterns of 115 Shigella spp, isolated from 5396 stool samples in our microbiology laboratory between 1999 and 2003, were investigated. Of the isolates, 96 (83.5%) were S. sonnei, 15 (13%) were S. flexneri, 3 (2.6%) were S. dysenteriae and 1 (1.9%) was S. boydii. Maximum isolation rates were observed at summer and fall seasons, especially in August, September and November (24%, 40%, 17%, respectively). The resistance rates against trimetoprime-sulphametoxasole and ampicillin were 79.1% and 19.1%, respectively. The rate of co-resistance against these two drugs was 12.2 percent. No isolate was found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin. Only one S. sonnei isolate had extended spectrum beta-lactamase detected by double-disk synergy test. In conclusion, ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for empirical treatment of shigellosis. However, to avoid the loss of this choice, ampicillin which still has an high effectivity rate, should be preferred for the treatment of shigellosis with the guidence of antibiogram results. On the other hand, emergence of ESBL production among Shigella spp. after Salmonella spp. should warn us about the unexpected results of inappropriate antibiotic therapy.","['Alici O', 'Açikgöz ZC', 'Gamberzade S', 'Göcer S', 'Karahocagil MK']",2006,40,1-2,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Alici O, et al.

16772414,Molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in Shigella sonnei isolates in Korea.,"The antimicrobial resistance of 122 Shigella sonnei isolates obtained in Korea during the period 1991-2000 was characterized. These isolates were highly resistant to traditional antibiotics such as trimethoprim (100 %), streptomycin (100 %), sulfamethoxazole (94 %), tetracycline (93 %) and nalidixic acid (90 %). All S. sonnei isolates carried Tn7 in their chromosomes. The 8.4 kb non-transferable resistance (R) plasmid carrying tetA, strA-strB and sul1 was found in 93 % of the S. sonnei isolates. Resistance to nalidixic acid first appeared in a S. sonnei isolate in 1997, and then in all S. sonnei isolates from 1998 and 1999. Resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics such as ampicillin was increased in S. sonnei isolates during the outbreak period 1998-2000. Resistance to ampicillin was mediated by the conjugative R plasmids carrying blaTEM-1. In conclusion, S. sonnei acquired antimicrobial resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics through the horizontal transfer of conjugative R plasmids, while the genetic stability of transposon and non-transferable R plasmids was responsible for resistance to traditional antibiotics.","['Seol SY', 'Kim YT', 'Jeong YS', 'Oh JY', 'Kang HY', 'Moon DC', 'Kim J', 'Lee YC', 'Cho DT', 'Lee JC']",2006,55,Pt 7,J Med Microbiol,"Seol SY, et al.

16766536,Molecular characteristics of class 1 and class 2 integrons and their relationships to antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the gene cassettes and determine the roles of class 1 and class 2 integrons in antibiotic-resistant strains of Shigella sonnei (n=31) and Shigella flexneri (n=33).
METHODS: Various molecular techniques, including PCR and Southern-blotting analysis, were used to analyse various markers of class 1 and class 2 integrons in these 64 S. sonnei and S. flexneri isolates collected in Hangzhou, China. The gene cassette arrays in integrons were identified by DNA sequencing and/or restriction fragment length polymorphism. Two genomic DNA fragments, one containing intI1 from a S. flexneri isolate that contains intI1 but lacks 3'-conserved region and another containing intI2 from a S. sonnei isolate, were cloned into pUC19 vectors and sequenced. The links between integron gene cassette arrays and antibiotic resistance were analysed.
RESULTS: Class 2 integrons were present in 80.6% (25/31) of the S. sonnei isolates and 87.9% (29/33) of the S. flexneri isolates. All of these integron 2-positive isolates contained constant gene cassette arrays of dfrA1+sat1+aadA1 which confer resistance to trimethoprim and streptomycin. It was demonstrated that the class 2 integron was located in the Tn7 region inside the attTn7 locus downstream of glmS in Shigella. Class 1 integrons were found in 9.4% (6/64) of Shigella spp. isolates. An atypical class 1 integron without a 3'-conserved segment on the Shigella chromosome, termed Shigella atypical class 1 integron (SAI), was present in 84.9% (28/33) of S. flexneri isolates. The SAI contained two gene cassettes, bla(OXA30) and aadA1; however, the SAI conferred resistance to ampicillin, but not to streptomycin, in Escherichia coli host. The bla(OXA30) and aadA1 cassettes of the SAI seemed to be always coordinately excised or integrated.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple and complex mechanisms involving mobile genetic elements in class 1 and class 2 integrons and antibiotic resistance have been developed in the evolution of Shigella strains.","['Pan JC', 'Ye R', 'Meng DM', 'Zhang W', 'Wang HQ', 'Liu KZ']",2006,58,2,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Pan JC, et al.

16765491,Role of Shigella flexneri 2a 34 kDa outer membrane protein in induction of protective immune response.,"Emergence of Shigella vaccine is in great need in developing countries. In this paper we have shown that 34 kDa Shigella flexneri 2a outer membrane protein has a role in eliciting immune responses. When injected parentarally this protein gives significant protection against challenge with virulent Shigella flexneri 2a. Macrophages activated with the 34 kDa protein resulted in the dose dependent production of nitric oxide, the highly reactive free radical responsible for killing of invading bacterial pathogen. Also, treatment of murine peritoneal macrophages with the 34 kDa protein showed dose dependent increase in the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12. However, there was no dose dependent increase in interleukin-10 production. These data indicated that the 34 kDa outer membrane protein has the ability to modulate the protective immune response against the invading bacterial pathogen, mainly through TH1 mediated pathway. So, the 34 kDa outer mebrane protein can be one of the major components for developing subunit vaccine against shigellosis.","['Mukhopadhaya A', 'Mahalanabis D', 'Chakrabarti MK']",2006,24,33-34,Vaccine,"Mukhopadhaya A, et al.

16705805,Prevalence of selected bacterial infections associated with the use of animal waste in Louisiana.,"Human health is a major concern when considering the disposal of large quantities of animal waste. Health concerns could arise from exposure to pathogens and excess nitrogen associated with this form of pollution. The objective was to collect and analyze health data related to selected bacterial infections associated with the use of animal waste in Louisiana. An analysis of adverse health effects has been conducted based on the incidence/prevalence rates of campylobacteriosis, E. coli O157:H7 infection, salmonellosis and shigellosis. The number of reported cases increased during the summer months. Analysis of health data showed that reported disease cases of E. coli O157:H7 were highest among Caucasian infants in the 0-4 year old age category and in Caucasian children in the 5-9 year old age category. Fatalities resulting from salmonellosis are low and increases sharply with age. The number of reported cases of shigellosis was found to be higher in African American males and females than in Caucasians. The high rate of identification in the younger population may result from the prompt seeking of medical care, as well as the frequent ordering of stool examination when symptoms become evident among this group of the population. The association with increasing age and fatality due to salmonellosis could be attributed to declining health and weaker immune systems often found in the older population. It is concluded that both animal waste and non-point source pollution may have a significant impact on human health.","['Hill DD', 'Owens WE', 'Tchounwou PB']",2005,2,1,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Hill DD, et al.

The 19 Sd1 isolates recovered from CAR outbreaks were multidrug resistant, although susceptible to quinolones and fluoroquinolones. Molecular subtyping by PFGE was more discriminatory than PP. The PFGE using XbaI and NotI restriction enzymes indicated that the two outbreaks were due to two different clones and also revealed a genetic diversity among the CS recovered from outbreak or sporadic cases between 1993 and 2003.

16684401,The emerging strains of Shigella dysenteriae type 2 in Bangladesh are clonal.,"A total of 113 strains of Shigella dysenteriae type 2 isolated from patients attending the Dhaka diarrhoea treatment centre of ICDDR,B: Centre for Health and Population Research during the period 1999-2004 were studied. Serotype of the isolates was confirmed using commercially available antisera. Except for arabinose fermentation, all the strains had similar biochemical reactions. More than 60% of the strains were sensitive to commonly used antibiotics; only 6% (n=7) of the strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, and none of the strains were resistant to mecillinam and ciprofloxacin. All strains were invasive as demonstrated by the presence of a 140 MDa plasmid, ial, sen and ipaH genes, Congo Red absorption ability and by the Sereny test performed on representative strains. Plasmid patterns were heterogeneous but more than 50% of strains were confined to a single pattern. All strains possessed a 1.6 MDa plasmid and 87% of the strains contained a 4 MDa plasmid. Middle-range plasmids (90 MDa to 30 MDa) present in 36% of the strains were not associated with antibiotic resistance. All the strains were clustered within a single type with four subtypes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis while ribotyping patterns of all the strains were identical.","['Talukder KA', 'Khajanchi BK', 'Islam MA', 'Dutta DK', 'Islam Z', 'Khan SI', 'Nair GB', 'Sack DA']",2006,134,6,Epidemiol Infect,"Talukder KA, et al.

16684096,Spherical body formation in the spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae.,"When cultures of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae were grown under a wide range of in vitro conditions, at least 1% of the cells formed spherical bodies different to the normal helical form. This percentage increased considerably in aging cultures or following their incubation in caramelized media. Spherical body formation was initiated from a terminal localized swelling of the outer sheath followed by a retraction of the protoplasmic cylinder into the resulting swollen vesicle. As this occurred, the periplasmic flagella seemed to unwind from the protoplasmic cylinder. Once retracted, the protoplasmic cylinder was found to be wrapped in an organized manner around the inner surface of the membrane of the swollen vesicle. Although most were 2-3 microm in diameter, some much larger spherical bodies (6-12 microm diameter) were occasionally seen, with a corresponding increase in the visible number of peripheral protoplasmic cylinder cross-sections. Spherical bodies from older cultures did not contain protoplasmic cylinders arranged around the periphery, but instead were characterized by the presence of a centrally located, electron-dense body c. 0.5-0.8 mum in diameter. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae spherical bodies differ in both their structural organization and probable method of formation from similar structures described in other spirochaete genera.","['Wood EJ', 'Seviour RJ', 'Siddique AB', 'Glaisher RW', 'Webb RI', 'Trott DJ']",2006,259,1,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Wood EJ, et al.

16632982,[The development of irritable bowel syndrome after Shigella infection: 3 year follow-up study].,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial gastroenteritis seems to be a risk factor of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The incidence of post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) was reported to be in the range of 7-31%, but few studies have reported long term follow-up results. So, we investigated the clinical course and prognosis of PI-IBS three years after shigella infection.
METHODS: The subjects were recruited from our previous study, in which we investigated the incidence and risk factors of PI-IBS. We had a questionnaire based on interview with 120 controls and 124 patients who had shigella infection three years ago. Both groups were evaluated for the presence of IBS, functional bowel disorders (FBD) except IBS before, one and three years after the infection, respectively.
RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (76.6%) and 105 controls (87.5%) completed the questionnaire. In patients group, 7 cases had IBS prior to infection (previous IBS), 12 cases (13.8%) had IBS after 1 year (PI-IBS). Four cases developed IBS newly after 3 years (new IBS). Thirteen cases (14.9%) in patients and 4 cases (4.5%) in controls had IBS over 3 years (OR 3.93: 1.20-12.86). The recovery rate over 3 years were 50.0% (2/4) in previous IBS and 25% (3/12) in PI-IBS. The incidence of PI-IBS after 3 years in previous FBD subjects was 28.6% and was 10.6% in normals (p<0.05). The female gender was a risk factor for FBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial gastroenteritis is a trigger factor of IBS. About a quarter of PI-IBS patients are recovered over 3 years.

16623986,A recurring outbreak of Shigella sonnei among traditionally observant Jewish children in New York City: the risks of daycare and household transmission.,"Dispersed community outbreaks of Shigella sonnei have occurred cyclically among traditionally observant Jews in the United States. In February 2000, we investigated a S. sonnei outbreak in one Jewish community in New York City. To determine risk factors for introduction of infection into households, we conducted a cohort study of households to compare risk factors for illness among primary subjects within households and age-matched well siblings. Isolates were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We used a random effects model to assess extra-household vs. intra-household transmission in households with multiple ill household members. Daycare or pre-school attendance [matched odds ratio (mOR) 16.1, P<0.001] and age <60 months (mOR 6.3, P<0.001) were independently associated with index subject illness. Outbreak isolates were closely related by PFGE analysis to the strain previously observed in Jewish community outbreaks. The random effects model strongly indicated that multiple illnesses in a single household are due to secondary transmission. Disease containment efforts should focus on reducing Shigella transmission in childcare settings and within homes.","['Garrett V', 'Bornschlegel K', 'Lange D', 'Reddy V', 'Kornstein L', 'Kornblum J', 'Agasan A', 'Hoekstra M', 'Layton M', 'Sobel J']",2006,134,6,Epidemiol Infect,"Garrett V, et al.

16616535,Homology modeling and molecular dynamics study of chorismate synthase from Shigella flexneri.,"Shigellosis is a major public health problem in many developing countries. Antibiotic therapy can reduce the severity of the dysentery and prevent potentially lethal complication. However, owing to the increased resistance to most of the widely used and inexpensive antibiotics, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents, particularly those that act on novel targets. Chorismate synthase (CS) is a key enzyme in the shikimic acid pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria. As an anti-bacterial drug target, CS has been well validated. A homology model of Shigella-CS with the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) binding was constructed using the crystal structure of CS from other species. The substrate 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) was subsequently docked into the active site based on previous theoretical studies. Molecular dynamics (MD) was used to refine the starting ternary model. The model was well conserved during the 1.8 ns MD simulation with the equilibrium root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 3.5 angstrom. The substrate binding energy was calculated and the electrostatic energy was found to be the most important term for binding. Decomposition of binding energies revealed that R129, R125, R327, R134 and R48 are important residues involved in substrate binding, which is useful for further site-directed mutagenesis experiments. In the absence of crystal structure, our study provides an early insight into the structure of CS from Shigella flexneri and its binding to the substrate and cofactor, thus facilitating the inhibitor design.","['Zhou H', 'Singh NJ', 'Kim KS']",2006,25,4,J Mol Graph Model,"Zhou H, et al.

The majority (79%) of Shigella species were isolated from children aged less than five years. An overall high resistance was observed for trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, mecillinam, and ciprofloxacin. There was a statistically significant (p < 0.001) increasing trend in the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in S. dysenteriae type 1.

16575113,Isolation & antimicrobial susceptibility of Shigella from patients with acute gastroenteritis in Western Nepal.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Shigellae play an important role as a causative organism of acute gastroenteritis, which is a global health problem with significant morbidity and mortality in especially in developing countries. This study was carried out to determine the isolation and pattern of antimicrobial resistance of Shigella in patients with acute gastroenteritis in western Nepal.
METHODS: The study included all patients with acute gastroenteritis who visited a tertiary care hospital at Pokhara, Nepal during a 2-year period (2002-2004). The isolates was confirmed as Shigella by biochemical reaction and slide agglutination test using specific antisera. Antibiotic sensitivity test was determined by agar diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drugs was detected.
RESULTS: Of the 770 stool samples, 83 (10.8%) yielded Shigella. Shigella flexneri caused 56 (67.4%) of the total cases of shigellosis followed by S. dysenteriae 12 (14.5%), S. sonnei 10 (12%) and S. boydii 5 (6%). Of the 83 isolates, 67 (80.7%) showed resistance to various drugs and 62 (74.7%) were resistant to two or more drugs. Resistance to cotrimoxazole was 80.7 per cent followed by tetracycline 74.7 per cent, ampicillin 53.0 per cent, nalidixic acid 31.3 per cent and ciprofloxacin 2.4 per cent. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of those drugs were also very high. All isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.

16528945,Use of a prospective space-time scan statistic to prioritize shigellosis case investigations in an urban jurisdiction.,"OBJECTIVE: A prospective space-time scan statistic was applied to Chicago's 2002 shigellosis surveillance data to evaluate its utility in objectively describing clusters and assisting in the prioritization of investigations.
METHODS: The prospective space-time module of SaTScan, a free software available online, was used to identify ""live"" clusters of disease, meaning cases that were current as of the date of the analysis and strongly associated in place and time. Fifty-two separate space-time analyses were run; one simulation for each week of 2002. Identified clusters were described in terms of space, time, risk factors reported by involved case-patients, and cases' links to venue-associated outbreaks.
RESULTS: Twelve live clusters were detected at the p < 0.05 significance level: two single-household clusters and 10 community clusters. The community clusters ranged in size from 194 to 367 census tracts (median = 294), and in disease burden from 21 to 41 cases (median = 29). Geographically, all of the community clusters were located in the west-central part of the city and had a temporal span of 28 days. Within the 10 community clusters, 15 different day care centers were identified as potential exposure settings for case-patients or their close contacts.
CONCLUSIONS: The prospective space-time scan statistic offers local health departments an objective way of describing clusters of shigellosis cases. The method used in this study could help prioritize the assignment and investigation of cases, particularly when overall shigellosis incidence exceeds expected numbers or when an agency's resources are stressed by other events, such as outbreaks.","['Jones RC', 'Liberatore M', 'Fernandez JR', 'Gerber SI']",2006,121,2,Public Health Rep,"Jones RC, et al.

28286448,Utility of the Nonabsorbed (<0.4%) Antibiotic Rifaximin in Gastroenterology and Hepatology.,"Oral antibiotics have probable or documented therapeutic utility for multiple enteric conditions commonly treated by gastroenterologists and hepatologists, but they are not frequently prescribed. Barriers to antibiotic use include concerns about bacterial resistance, drug interactions, and antibiotic-associated side effects and toxicity, particularly in vulnerable populations. The use of minimally absorbed oral antibiotics has been suggested as an approach to overcoming some of these barriers, but minimally absorbed antibiotics have not been an important part of the US gastroenterologists' or hepatologists' armamentarium until recently. The 2004 introduction in the United States of the nonabsorbed (<0.4%) oral antibiotic rifaximin is cause for reassessing the potential usefulness of minimally absorbed oral antibiotics for bacterial enteric illness. Rifaximin has broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activity against enteric pathogens, gut-localized action, and minimal systemic absorption-a profile consistent with usefulness for a range of enteric conditions involving a pathogenetic role of bacteria. The emerging clinical profile of rifaximin also supports its potential utility for multiple enteric conditions. Rifaximin has a tolerability profile comparable to that of placebo and is not known to interact clinically with other medications. The efficacy of rifaximin is well documented for the treatment of infectious diarrhea caused by noninvasive pathogens and hepatic encephalopathy. A growing body of data supports the efficacy of rifaximin for additional enteric conditions, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth, pouchitis, and antibiotic-associated colitis, that are characterized by acute bacterial infection or bacterial colonization. In addition, rifaximin has recently been demonstrated effective in the prevention of travelers' diarrhea and shigellosis in controlled clinical studies. Ongoing studies and more experience with rifaximin in clinical practice will help to further define the role of this antibiotic in gastroenterology and hepatology.","['Su CG', 'Aberra F', 'Lichtenstein GR']",2006,2,3,Gastroenterol Hepatol (N Y),"Su CG, et al.

The multidrug resistant Shigella flexneri NK1925 was isolated from a patient of Infectious Diseases Hospital, Kolkata, India. This strain contained five plasmids ranging in size from 3 to 212 kb. After curing of five plasmids, this strain became sensitive to antibiotics. A plasmidless multidrug-resistant strain Burkholderia cepacia DR11 was isolated during the survey of microorganisms from coastal waters of deltaic Sunderbans. This strain always released a temperate phage BcP15 into culture supernatant. Turbid plaque formation was observed on the lawn of a plasmidless version (Pl(-)35) of Shigella flexneri NK1925. A few distinct clones (Pl(-)35R) appeared within the region of each plaque after 18 h incubation. S. flexneri NK1925, Pl(-)35, and Pl(-)35R clones showed the same PFGE band pattern of XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA. However, Pl(-)35R clones were resistant to co-trimoxazole, trimethoprim, and eryth- romycin, to which B. cepacia DR11 was also resistant. Southern hybridization results indicated that these three antibiotic resistances in Pl(-)35R clones were due to a BcP15 phage lysogen in the Pl(-)35 version of S. flexneri NK1925.","['Hens DK', 'Chatterjee NC', 'Kumar R']",2006,151,7,Arch Virol,"Hens DK, et al.

RESULTS: Of those with diarrhea, 40.9% were less than one year old and 71.0% were less than two years old. A potential pathogen was identified in 67.3% of children with diarrhea. They were group A rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, with prevalences of 46.7%, 22.5%, 4.7%, and 7.3%, respectively. No Salmonella spp or Vibrio cholerae were isolated. Rotavirus and diarrheagenic E. coli were predominant in children less than two years of age, while Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis were mostly seen in the older children. Diarrheagenic E. coli and Shigella spp showed high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Children attending the hospitals had fever (43.6%), vomiting (53.8%), and dehydration (82.6%). Watery stool was predominant with a prevalence of 66.4%, followed by mucous stool (21.0%). The mean episodes of stools per day was seven, ranging from two to 23 episodes. Before attending hospitals, 162/587 (27.6%) children had been given antibiotics. Overall, more children got diarrhea in (i) poor families; (ii) families where piped water and a latrine were lacking; (iii) families where mothers washed their hands less often before feeding the children; (iv) families where mothers had a low level of education; (v) families where information on health and sanitation less often reached their households.
CONCLUSIONS: Group A rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis play an important role in causing diarrhea in children in Hanoi, Vietnam. Epidemiological factors such as lack of fresh water supply, unhygienic septic tank, low family income, lack of health information, and low educational level of parents could contribute to the morbidity of diarrhea in children.","['Vu Nguyen T', 'Le Van P', 'Le Huy C', 'Nguyen Gia K', 'Weintraub A']",2006,10,4,Int J Infect Dis,"Vu Nguyen T, et al.

16424198,Characterization of functional oligosaccharide mimics of the Shigella flexneri serotype 2a O-antigen: implications for the development of a chemically defined glycoconjugate vaccine.,"Protection against reinfection with noncapsulated Gram-negative bacteria, such as Shigella, an enteroinvasive bacterium responsible for bacillary dysentery, is mainly achieved by Abs specific for the O-Ag, the polysaccharide part of the LPS, the major bacterial surface Ag. The use of chemically defined glycoconjugates encompassing oligosaccharides mimicking the protective determinants carried by the O-Ag, thus expected to induce an efficient anti-LPS Ab response, has been considered an alternative to detoxified LPS-protein conjugate vaccines. The aim of this study was to identify such functional oligosaccharide mimics of the S. flexneri serotype 2a O-Ag. Using protective murine mAbs specific for S. flexneri serotype 2a and synthetic oligosaccharides designed to analyze the contribution of each sugar residue of the branched pentasaccharide repeating unit of the O-Ag, we demonstrated that the O-Ag exhibited an immunodominant serotype-specific determinant. We also showed that elongating the oligosaccharide sequence improved Ab recognition. From these antigenicity data, selected synthetic oligosaccharides were assessed for their potential to mimic the O-Ag by analyzing their immunogenicity in mice when coupled to tetanus toxoid via single point attachment. Our results demonstrated that induction of an efficient serotype 2a-specific anti-O-Ag Ab response was dependent on the length of the oligosaccharide sequence. A pentadecasaccharide representing three biological repeating units was identified as a potential candidate for further development of a chemically defined glycoconjugate vaccine against S. flexneri 2a infection.","['Phalipon A', 'Costachel C', 'Grandjean C', 'Thuizat A', 'Guerreiro C', 'Tanguy M', 'Nato F', 'Vulliez-Le Normand B', 'Bélot F', 'Wright K', 'Marcel-Peyre V', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Mulard LA']",2006,176,3,J Immunol,"Phalipon A, et al.

However, four waterborne outbreaks of shigellosis have been recorded in Greece in the last three decades, in different areas of the country, under different environmental and socioeconomic conditions. This study presents the epidemiological characteristics of these four outbreaks in order to examine common points and differences and to investigate their possible association with environmental and socioeconomic conditions. All four outbreaks were caused by Shigella sonnei and related to drinking water. Epidemic curves, distribution of cases by age and gender, hospitalization rates, environmental conditions and laboratory results were compared. The outbreaks seemed to correspond to two different 'models' presenting two characteristic types of epidemic waves related to specific environmental conditions. The attack rates for the general population varied from about 9 to 13% and were similar for both sexes. Children were affected mostly. In these outbreaks there was a strong suspicion of contamination of the water distribution system from the sewage network, highlighting the importance of environmental health control measures.","['Koutsotoli AD', 'Papassava ME', 'Maipa VE', 'Alamanos YP']",2006,134,1,Epidemiol Infect,"Koutsotoli AD, et al.

This report describes HIV and other sexually transmitted disease (STD) trends among MSM in metropolitan Atlanta by analyzing nine databases. We describe the use of the male-to-female (M:F) ratio, a surrogate marker for MSM in databases without standardized MSM variables that is recommended as an indirect measure of HIV risk behavior in the CDC/HRSA Integrated Guidelines for Developing Epidemiologic Profiles. During 1997 to 2001, there were increases among MSM for reported syphilis (from 9% to 17%), anti-biotic-resistant gonorrhea (from 4.8% to 8.6%), and HIV seroprevalence (from 33% to 43%). During 1998 to 2001, the M:F ratio for cases peaked at 12:1 during a hepatitis A outbreak among MSM, increased for shigellosis (from 1:0 to 18:1) and giardiasis (from 1.7 to 2.1), and did not appreciably change for hepatitis B, salmonellosis, or chlamydia. HIV and several other STDs appear to have increased among MSM in metropolitan Atlanta.

16394329,Re-emergence of multi-drug resistant Shigella dysenteriae with added resistance to ciprofloxacin in north India & their plasmid profiles.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Multi drug resistant Shigellae pose a major threat in control of shigellosis with. Shigella dysenteriae being the most prevalent species at our centre before 1994. A gradual decrease in S. dysenteriae occurred over the years with a corresponding increase in S. flexneri which became the predominant serotype. From May to November 2003, an increase in number of patients admitted with clinical diagnosis of dysentery was noted in comparison to previous years, with a corresponding increase in the isolation of multi drug resistant S. dysenteriae. We report here the re-emergence of multi drug resistant S. dysenteriae at our tertiary care centre in north India after a gap of about 10 yr. Plasmid analysis of S. dysenteriae was also performed to study the origin and clonality of the isolates.
METHODS: Stool samples were collected in Cary-Blair medium and processed by standard methods. Shigellae were confirmed by serotyping. Minimum inhibitory concentration was done by agar dilution method and E-test. Plasmid profiling of 18 isolates (16 S. dysenteriae 1 and 2 S. dysenteriae 2) was performed by modified alkali lysis method. Clinical details of patients were noted.
RESULTS: A total of 64 patients with dysentery were admitted during the study period. Patients presented with unusually severe symptoms and six developed complications. Treatment failure with ciprofloxacin occurred in six patients who received cefotaxime and amikacin. There were 38 children below 5 yr of age. S. dysenteriae (18 isolates of S. dysenteriae 1 and 2 isolates of S. dysenteriae 2) were isolated from 20 of the 64 (31.2%) stool samples. S. dysenteriae re-emerged as the commonest isolate after a gap of nearly 10 yr. Fourteen of the 20 S. dysenteriae isolates were multi drug resistant; 12 were resistant to ciprofloxacin with MIC of 8-32 mug/ml. Plasmid profile analysis revealed that 6 of 11 ciprofloxacin resistant S. dysenteriae 1 had similar profiles.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Emergence of a clone of ciprofloxacin resistant S. dysenteriae 1 in north India is disturbing as treatment options in our geographic area are limited in view of already existing high drug resistance to nalidixic acid, co-trimoxazole and amoxycillin. A close monitoring of shifts in serogroup distribution and antibiotic resistance is required to guide clinicians for treatment of shigellosis.","['Taneja N', 'Lyngdoh V', 'Vermani A', 'Mohan B', 'Rao P', 'Singh M', 'Dogra A', 'Singh MP', 'Sharma M']",2005,122,4,Indian J Med Res,"Taneja N, et al.

16394013,Anti-inflammatory effect of Lactobacillus casei on Shigella-infected human intestinal epithelial cells.,"Shigella invades the human intestinal mucosa, thus causing bacillary dysentery, an acute recto-colitis responsible for lethal complications, mostly in infants and toddlers. Conversely, commensal bacteria live in a mutualistic relationship with the intestinal mucosa that is characterized by homeostatic control of innate responses, thereby contributing to tolerance to the flora. Cross-talk established between commensals and the intestinal epithelium mediate this active process, the mechanisms of which remain largely uncharacterized. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei belong to a subclass of these commensals that modulate mucosal innate responses and possibly display anti-inflammatory properties. We analyzed whether L. casei could attenuate the pro-inflammatory signaling induced by Shigella flexneri after invasion of the epithelial lining. Cultured epithelial cells were infected with L. casei, followed by a challenge with S. flexneri. Using macroarray DNA chips, we observed that L. casei down-regulated the transcription of a number of genes encoding pro-inflammatory effectors such as cytokines and chemokines and adherence molecules induced by invasive S. flexneri. This resulted in an anti-inflammatory effect that appeared mediated by the inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway, particularly through stabilization of I-kappaBalpha. In a time-course experiment using GeneChip hybridization analysis, the expression of many genes involved in ubiquitination and proteasome processes were modulated during L. casei treatment. Thus, L. casei has developed a sophisticated means to maintain intestinal homeostasis through a process that involves manipulation of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway upstream of I-kappaBalpha.","['Tien MT', 'Girardin SE', 'Regnault B', 'Le Bourhis L', 'Dillies MA', 'Coppée JY', 'Bourdet-Sicard R', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Pédron T']",2006,176,2,J Immunol,"Tien MT, et al.

Inoculum of 12 x 10(8) Sd1 provoked dysenteric diarrhea within 24 h. Feces of healthy rats were molded, brown to black and rough. Rats developing diarrhea presented blood at the anal orifice; stools were soft or liquid containing mucus, or molded, smooth and mucus-coated. At times, stools appeared longer, dark and shiny due to the presence of mucus and blood, or molded, lumpy and brittle. Diarrheal induction was associated with abdominal ailment, progressive increase in stool weight and frequency, and increase in bacterial population. Sixty-seven percent of the total number of deaths had occurred by day 6 after diarrheal induction.

16364513,Development and evaluation of a Shigella flexneri 2a and S. sonnei bivalent invasin complex (Invaplex) vaccine.,"Over 160 million cases of shigellosis occur annually worldwide, with the two most prevalent species being Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Protective immunity against Shigella infection is primarily directed at the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the homologous serotype, so it may be necessary to combine monovalent vaccines for multiple Shigella serotypes to construct a multivalent vaccine against predominant serotypes. Recently, we described a subcellular vaccine isolated from virulent S. flexneri, consisting of proteins (including the invasins IpaB and IpaC) and LPS, that protected mice and guinea pigs from homologous challenge. In the present study, a bivalent Invaplex vaccine consisting of S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei Invaplex was used to intranasally immunize mice and guinea pigs to determine the bivalent vaccine's immunogenicity and protective capacity against challenge with either strain. Mice and guinea pigs immunized with the bivalent S. flexneri 2a/S. sonnei Invaplex vaccine produced serum IgA and IgG antibodies to S. flexneri LPS, S. sonnei LPS, the homologous Invaplex and the water extract antigens (invasins) as determined by ELISA. The immune responses in animals immunized with the bivalent vaccine were similar to responses in animals immunized with the monovalent Invaplex vaccines. Mice and guinea pigs immunized with the bivalent vaccine were protected from a lethal lung challenge (mice, P<0.001) or severe keratoconjunctivitis (guinea pigs, P< or = 0.002) after challenge with either S. flexneri 2a or S. sonnei. Animals immunized with monovalent Invaplex vaccines were protected (P<0.001) against the homologous agent at levels comparable to the bivalent vaccine. After challenge, immunized animals demonstrated boosts in antibody titers to LPS, water extract antigens and Invaplex. These studies indicate that the subcellular Invaplex vaccine will be readily adaptable to a multivalent vaccine approach for shigellosis.","['Oaks EV', 'Turbyfill KR']",2006,24,13,Vaccine,Oaks EV and Turbyfill KR.

In order to determine the usefulness of such marker for neutrophilic activity in differentiating cases suffering from amoebic and bacillary dysentery, Schistosoma and bacterial UTI infections, we examined stool and urine specimens using anti-lactoferrin antibodies (lactoferrin latex agglutination test: LFLA), compared with different standard gold techniques. Our results demonstrated that cases with either shigllosis or UTI revealed a high lactoferrin titer which was positively correllated with the number of PMN. In addition cases with Entamoeba histolytica or S. haematobium were characterized by relatively lower inflammatory process as expressed by mild lactoferrin titer which was also correlated with the PMN count. In addition, the findings of the present work indicated that LFLA was sensitive and specific when used alone and its sensitivity was augmented after coupling with other simple indirect methods of diagnosis. In conclusion, results described the reliability of using LFLA as a simple, rapid, sensitive method in differentiating, certain parasitic from bacterial diseases.","['Aly SM', 'El-Zawawy LA', 'Said DE', 'Fathy FM', 'Mohamed ON']",2005,35,3 Suppl,J Egypt Soc Parasitol,"Aly SM, et al.

We describe a large, multiple-restaurant outbreak of Shigella flexneri serotype 2a infection that was associated with tomatoes.
METHODS: We conducted nationwide surveillance and a case-control study, collected fecal specimens for culture, and measured the survival of the outbreak strain of S. flexneri in tomatoes.
RESULTS: We interviewed 306 of 886 ill restaurant patrons and 167 control subjects. Matched univariate analysis showed that several food items were associated with illness, but only tomatoes remained significant in multivariate models. Illness peaked at each restaurant within 24 h after the arrival of hand-sorted bruised and overripe tomatoes from a new distributor; all patient isolates that were tested were indistinguishable by PFGE. Sliced tomatoes from the distributor were inoculated with the outbreak strain, and viable S. flexneri were recovered for 72 h.
CONCLUSION: To prevent such outbreaks, persons with shigellosis should be excluded from handling food at all points along the distribution chain.","['Reller ME', 'Nelson JM', 'Mølbak K', 'Ackman DM', 'Schoonmaker-Bopp DJ', 'Root TP', 'Mintz ED']",2006,42,2,Clin Infect Dis,"Reller ME, et al.

16343387,Quinine sulfate inhibits invasion of Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri: a preliminary study.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of typhoid fever and shigellosis parallels that of malaria, so many individuals who are on antimalarial drugs can be found in areas where these diseases are widespread. We investigated the effect of quinine sulfate on the growth and invasion of Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri M90T to determine whether people on antimalarials can have secondary gain from some protection against typhoid fever and shigellosis.
METHODS: The effect of 50 and 100 microM quinine sulfate on the invasive ability of Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri M90T into human colon adenocarcinoma-2 (Caco-2) cells was studied during the infection period. The invasive efficiency was expressed as the number of viable internalized bacteria by counting the colony-forming units.
RESULTS: The invasive ability of Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri M90T was significantly inhibited by 50 and 100 microM quinine sulfate in a dose-dependent manner (for Salmonella typhimurium) when the drug was added to Caco-2 cell monolayers during the infection period.
CONCLUSIONS: Since so many people who are on antimalarial drugs visit and inhabit areas that are endemic to typhoid fever and Shigella infection, a study on the influence of these drugs on the disease is long overdue. Our data indicate that quinine sulfate interferes with the invasion and internalization of Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri M90T into host cells. Further studies on additional strains/serotypes with other newer antimalarials at various concentrations are needed to verify this effect of quinine sulfate and to draw conclusions on its significance in vivo.","['Wolf R', 'Grimaldi E', 'Donnarumma G', 'Greco R', 'Auricchio L', 'De Filippis A', 'Tufano MA']",2005,12,6,J Travel Med,"Wolf R, et al.

This investigation was carried out to institute an effective counterplan, and study the infection source and transmission of the shigellosis.
METHODS: The authors conducted a questionnaire survey among 235 students and staff from S preschool, primary and middle school relating to the ingestion of school lunch and the manifestation of symptoms. Also, the author investigated the drinking water, feeding facility and reconstructed cooking process of the food presumed to be the cause of the shigellosis. The diarrhea cases were defined as confirmed cases and those cases who had had diarrhea more than one time, accompanied with symptoms such as fever, vomiting and tenesmus.
RESULTS: From rectal swabs 20 people, between June 28 and July 4, 2003, were confirmed with shigellosis. The diarrhea attack rate was 40.0%. Those who had ingested tomatoes and cubed radish kimchi had significantly higher diarrhea attack rates (p<0.05), with the relative risk of tomatoes being 2.69 (95% CI: 0.98-7.42). The major cause of shigellosis was presumed to be from contaminated tomatoes due to cooking with rubber gloves containing holes.
CONCLUSION: The cooks in charge of school lunches must make doubly sure to not only attend to their sanitation, but also to manage the table wear and items used in providing school lunches.

METHODS: 692 subjects completed a questionnaire and provided a swab for microbiological examinations and 7 environmental specimens were examined for bacterial organisms. PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) and fingerprinting were performed to find the genetic relationship among the temporally associated sporadic isolates.
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients had symptoms consistent with the case definition, with 13 confirmed and 16 suspected cases. The frequency of diarrhea was 6 times or more a day (80.8%), with a duration of 1 to 4 days (88.5%) in most cases. The most common symptoms accompanying the diarrhea were fever (80.9%) followed by abdominal pain (76.9%), headache (65.4%), chill (61.5%), vomiting (46.2%) and tenesmus (15.4%). The epidemic curve was characteristic of a person-to-person transmission. The PFGE and fingerprinting demonstrated identical or similar DNA patterns among the 3 Shigella sonnei isolates (A51, A53 and A61 types) found in this outbreak.
CONCLUSION: A genetically identical strain of S. sonnei was estimated to be the cause of this outbreak, and the mode of transmission was most likely person-to-person.","['Lee YJ', 'Hwang UK', 'Kim JS', 'Kim JY', 'Koo JS', 'Lee BK', 'Kang JW']",2005,38,2,J Prev Med Public Health,"Lee YJ, et al.

16315747,[Changing patterns of communicable diseases in Korea].,"Before twentieth centuries and during early twentieth centuries, communicable diseases were the major cause of morbidity and mortality in Korea. But reliable data are not available. After 1975, the overall morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases, rapidly declined. Recently many new pathogenic microbes were recognized: L. monocytogenes, Hantaan virus, Y. pseudotuberculosis, P. multocida, L. pneumophilia, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), G. seoi, H. capsulatum, C. burnetii, V. cholerae 0139, C. parvum, F. tularensis, E. coli 0157:H7, B. burgdorferi, S. Typhimurium DT104, Rotavirus, hepatitis C virus and so on. Since the first HIV infection recognized in 1985, the reported cases of infection and deaths from HIV/AIDS have been steady increased each year. Legionnaire's disease, E. coli 0157:H7 colitis, listeriosis and crytosporidiasis have been occurring just sporadically among immunocompromized cases. Many re-emerging communicable diseases were occurred in Korea: leptospirosis, malaria, endemic typhus, cholera, tsutsugamushi disease, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, shigellosis, mumps, measles, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, brucellosis and so on. Leptospirosis and tsutsugamushi diseases have been noticed as major public health problems since 1980s. The malaria that had been virtually disappeared for a decade has reappeared from 1993 with striking increase of patients in recent 3-4 years. The distributions of salmonella and shigella serotypes have been changed a lot in recent few decades. Furthermore rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains induces more difficult and complex problems in control of communicable diseases. We must recognize on the importance of environment and ecosystem conservation and careful prescription of anti-microbial agent in order to prevent communicable diseases.",['Lim HS'],2005,38,2,J Prev Med Public Health,Lim HS.

METHODS: Using standard microbiological techniques we examined stool samples from 169 children (70 females) aged a few days to 12 years with acute diarrhea for viral, bacterial and parasitological agents. We used the disc diffusion method to determine the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to antimicrobial agents. We carried out the study between April 2000 to March 2001.
RESULTS: We detected a single agent in 44.4%, rotavirus in 26.6%, Salmonella in 13.6%, and Cryptosporidium in 13% of patients and other enteric pathogens, Shigella in 3.6%, Aeromonas in 5.5%, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar in 11.8, and Giardia lamblia in 1.2%. Serotyping of isolated Salmonella resulted in 21 being Salmonella enteric serotype heidelberg and 3 Salmonella enteritidis. We detected both serotypes in one child. More than 75% of the isolated Salmonella were resistant to 6 different commonly used antimicrobial agents.
CONCLUSION: We found rotavirus, non-typhoid Salmonella and Cryptosporidium to be the most important enteric agents associated with childhood diarrhea in Zliten. The isolated bacterial pathogens showed high resistant rates, particularly among the Salmonella, to the commonly used antimicrobial agents. The ease of which one can obtain these drugs in Zliten may play a role in such resistance.","['Ali MB', 'Ghenghesh KS', 'Aissa RB', 'Abuhelfaia A', 'Dufani M']",2005,26,11,Saudi Med J,"Ali MB, et al.

16308937,[Significance of determination of Shigella antibiotic resistance in bacteriological diagnosis of dysentery].,"The results of the Shigella antibiotic susceptibility assay within 1995-2002 are presented. 1472 cultures from 1158 patients with intestinal infections and bacteria carriers were isolated. The isolates were tested for their susceptibility to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, ampicillin and ofloxacin. It was shown that S. flexneri and S. sonnei were resistant to tetracycline. The S. flexneri isolates were highly resistant to chloramphenicol (73.3 to 96.0%) while resistance to it in the isolates of S. sonnei varied from 7.7 to 88.5%. In this connection the Levin medium with tetracycline was used to increase the Shigella isolation. In the study of the culture media efficiency with respect to isolation of Shigella it was observed that the Levin medium with tetracycline provided higher rates of S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolation (2.3- and 1.7-fold increase respectively) vs. the Shigella isolation on the Ploskirev medium without the antibiotic.","['Novokshonova IV', 'Zelenskaia OI', ""Gol'dberg IE"", 'Kozlikhin BA', 'Shneĭderman LV']",2005,50,2-3,Antibiot Khimioter,"Novokshonova IV, et al.

Susceptibility tests revealed high levels of resistance, especially to ampicillin (65%), tetracycline (78%) and trimethoprim (75%), and particularly among the S. flexneri isolates. Dihydrofolate reductase 1 genes (dfrA1) were prevalent among the trimethoprim-resistant isolates, while oxa genes predominated among the ampicillin-resistant isolates. Chloramphenicol resistance was associated with production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, while nalidixic acid-resistant isolates had a single mutation in the gyrA gene.

Three single-dose regimens of WRSS1 (5 x 10(3) CFU, 2 x 10(4) CFU, and 4 x 10(5) CFU) were tested with cohorts of 15 adult volunteers. The vaccine was generally well tolerated at the 10(3)- and 10(4)-CFU doses. There were no fevers and there was one report of moderate diarrhea in 30 vaccinees; five additional vaccinees reported mild diarrhea. At the 10(5)-CFU dose, there were two reports of low-grade fevers and four reports of moderate diarrhea. The geometric means for immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody-secreting cells (ASC) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were 30, 75, and 193 ASC per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for the 10(3)-, 10(4)-, and 10(5)-CFU doses, respectively. The IgG means were 40, 46, and 135 ASC per 10(6) PBMC, respectively. The 10(4)-CFU dose of WRSS1 gave the best balance of safety and immunogenicity, since all vaccinees had a significant IgA ASC response and 73% had a response of more than 50 ASC. The anti-LPS seroconversion rate (threefold) for IgA was 60% and the IgG rate was 27% for the 10(4)-CFU cohort. Each vaccinee and a cohabitating household contact delivered daily perianal stool swabs for bacteriological culture. WRSS1 colonized vaccinees for a median of 5 days, and one individual excreted WRSS1 intermittently for 23 days. None of the 45 household contacts were colonized with WRSS1 after a cumulative 192 days of cohabitation with colonized vaccinees, suggesting that adventitious vaccine spread was not common in the community setting.","['Orr N', 'Katz DE', 'Atsmon J', 'Radu P', 'Yavzori M', 'Halperin T', 'Sela T', 'Kayouf R', 'Klein Z', 'Ambar R', 'Cohen D', 'Wolf MK', 'Venkatesan MM', 'Hale TL']",2005,73,12,Infect Immun,"Orr N, et al.

16288683,Detection of intra-familial transmission of shigella infection using conventional serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.,"Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is commonly used in molecular epidemiology. However, this technique has never been used in studying intra-family spread of enteric diseases in Bangladesh. Our objective was to evaluate the intra-familial transmission of shigella infection using PFGE. Children of either sex, less than 10 years old, who were family contacts of shigella-infected index cases were the study population. PFGE was applied if the same serotypes/sub-serotypes of shigella were isolated from both the index case and the family contact children. In total, 227 index cases were studied. Shigella was isolated from 61 (27%) contact children on day 1 of enrolment, among which Shigella flexneri (41%) and S. boydii (41%) were dominant, followed by S. dysenteriae (10%), S. sonnei (3%), and shigella-like organisms (5%). Seventeen (28%) of the asymptomatic infections in contact children were caused by the same serotype of shigella as that found in the index case. The intra-familial shigella transmission rate was 8% (17/227). Of the 227 contact children, eight (4%) developed diarrhoea during a 10-day follow-up and shigella was isolated from five (2%) of these children, and three of them (S. flexneri 3a, 1b, and 3a) were identical to the strains from their respective index cases. Compared to children without asymptomatic carriage of shigella (2/166), the risk (odds ratio) of developing diarrhoea for the children with asymptomatic carriage of shigella identical to their cases (3/17) was 9.0 (95% CI 1.5-49.0, P=0.01). The attributable risk for symptomatic shigella infection by intra-familial transmission was 50%. Results of this study demonstrated that intra-familial transmission of shigella carries a higher risk for diarrhoea.","['Khan AI', 'Talukder KA', 'Huq S', 'Mondal D', 'Malek MA', 'Dutta DK', 'Nair GB', 'Faruque AS']",2006,134,3,Epidemiol Infect,"Khan AI, et al.

16283050,Estimating the burden of shigellosis in Thailand: 36-month population-based surveillance study.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate incidence of shigellosis in the Kaengkhoi district, Saraburi Province, Thailand.
METHODS: Population-based surveillance of shigellosis based in treatment centres. The detected rates of treated shigellosis were corrected for the number of cases missed due to the low sensitivity of microbiological culture methods and participants' use of health-care providers not participating in the study.
FINDINGS: The overall uncorrected incidence of shigellosis was 0.6/1000 population per year (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5-0.8). The unadjusted incidence of treated shigellosis was highest among children less than 5 years old (4/1000 children per year; 95% CI = 3-6) and significantly lower among people aged > 5 years (0.3/1000 population per year; 95% CI = 0.2-0.5; P < 0.001). Adjusting for cases likely to be missed as a result of culture and surveillance methods increased estimates approximately five times. The majority of Shigella isolates (122/146; 84%) were S. sonnei; the rest were S. flexneri. Of the 22 S. flexneri isolates, the three most frequently encountered serotypes were 2a (36%), 1b (23%) and 3b (28%). A total of 90-95% of S. sonnei and S. flexneri isolates were resistant to tetracycline and co-trimoxazole. In contrast to S. sonnei isolates, more than 90% of the S. flexneri isolates were also resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Estimates of incidence of Shigella infection in the community are 10-fold to 100-fold greater than those found from routine government surveillance. The high prevalence of Shigella strains resistant to multiple antibiotics adds urgency to the development of a vaccine to protect against shigellosis in this region of Thailand.","['Chompook P', 'Samosornsuk S', 'von Seidlein L', 'Jitsanguansuk S', 'Sirima N', 'Sudjai S', 'Mangjit P', 'Kim DR', 'Wheeler JG', 'Todd J', 'Lee H', 'Ali M', 'Clemens J', 'Tapchaisri P', 'Chaicumpa W']",2005,83,10,Bull World Health Organ,"Chompook P, et al.

We describe an outbreak in a school in Madrid caused by person-to-person transmission of Shigella sonnei. After the detection of Shigella sonnei in a stool sample from a 3 year old girl, an investigation at her school was initiated. Questionnaires were distributed to the parents of 520 pupils attending the school. A case was defined as a school case if it was the first case in a child's household, and as a household case if other members of the household had fallen ill first. We identified 88 cases (60 pupils and 28 of their family members). The attack rate (AR) was 12% in the school and 32% in the families. There was a significant association between higher AR and lower age. The outbreak lasted for two months. The length and the shape of the epidemic curve of the 60 cases in pupils suggests person-to-person transmission. Shigella sonnei isolated from 5 different cases were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and was found to be an identical strain. The prolonged duration of the outbreak was probably due to delayed detection, and stopped as soon as control measures were introduced.","['Jonsson J', 'Alvarez-Castillo Mdel C', 'Sanz JC', 'Ramiro R', 'Ballester E', 'Fernánez M', 'Echeita MA', 'Martínez Navarro F']",2005,10,10,Euro Surveill,"Jonsson J, et al.

16275786,"Genome dynamics and diversity of Shigella species, the etiologic agents of bacillary dysentery.","The Shigella bacteria cause bacillary dysentery, which remains a significant threat to public health. The genus status and species classification appear no longer valid, as compelling evidence indicates that Shigella, as well as enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, are derived from multiple origins of E.coli and form a single pathovar. Nevertheless, Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 causes deadly epidemics but Shigella boydii is restricted to the Indian subcontinent, while Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei are prevalent in developing and developed countries respectively. To begin to explain these distinctive epidemiological and pathological features at the genome level, we have carried out comparative genomics on four representative strains. Each of the Shigella genomes includes a virulence plasmid that encodes conserved primary virulence determinants. The Shigella chromosomes share most of their genes with that of E.coli K12 strain MG1655, but each has over 200 pseudogenes, 300 approximately 700 copies of insertion sequence (IS) elements, and numerous deletions, insertions, translocations and inversions. There is extensive diversity of putative virulence genes, mostly acquired via bacteriophage-mediated lateral gene transfer. Hence, via convergent evolution involving gain and loss of functions, through bacteriophage-mediated gene acquisition, IS-mediated DNA rearrangements and formation of pseudogenes, the Shigella spp. became highly specific human pathogens with variable epidemiological and pathological features.","['Yang F', 'Yang J', 'Zhang X', 'Chen L', 'Jiang Y', 'Yan Y', 'Tang X', 'Wang J', 'Xiong Z', 'Dong J', 'Xue Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Xu X', 'Sun L', 'Chen S', 'Nie H', 'Peng J', 'Xu J', 'Wang Y', 'Yuan Z', 'Wen Y', 'Yao Z', 'Shen Y', 'Qiang B', 'Hou Y', 'Yu J', 'Jin Q']",2005,33,19,Nucleic Acids Res,"Yang F, et al.

One hundred severely-malnourished children (weight-for-age <60% of median of the National Center for Health Statistics), with a positive stool culture for Shigella dysenteriae type 1 or S. flexneri, who died during hospitalization, were compared with another 100 similar children (weight-for-age <60% and with S. dysenteriae type 1 or S. flexneri-associated infection) discharged alive. Children aged less than four years were admitted during December 1993-January 1999. The median age of the cases who died or recovered was 9 months and 12 months respectively. Bronchopneumonia, abdominal distension, absent or sluggish bowel sound, clinical anaemia, altered consciousness, hypothermia, clinical sepsis, low or imperceptible pulse, dehydration, hypoglycaemia, high creatinine, and hyperkalaemia were all significantly more frequent in cases than in controls. In multivariate regression analysis, altered consciousness (odds ratio [OR]=2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-6.8), hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <3 mmol/L (OR=7.8, 95% CI 2.9-19.6), hypothermia (temperature <36 degrees C) (OR=5.7, 95% CI 1.5-22.1), and bronchopneumonia (OR=2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.5) were identified as significant risk factors for mortality. Severely-malnourished children with shigellosis having hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, altered consciousness and/or bronchopneumonia were at high risk of death. Based on the findings, the study recommends that early diagnosis of shigellosis in severely-malnourished children and assertive therapy for proper management to prevent development of hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, bronchopneumonia, or altered consciousness and its immediate treatment are likely to reduce Shigella-related mortality in severely-malnourished children.","['van den Broek JM', 'Roy SK', 'Khan WA', 'Ara G', 'Chakraborty B', 'Islam S', 'Banu B']",2005,23,3,J Health Popul Nutr,"van den Broek JM, et al.

METHODS: We conducted a two-year community-based surveillance study from August 2001 to July 2003 in an impoverished area of North Jakarta to assess the burden of diarrhoea, shigellosis, and cholera. At participating health care providers, a case report form was completed and stool sample collected from cases presenting with diarrhoea.
RESULTS: Infants had the highest incidences of diarrhoea (759/1,000/year) and cholera (4/1,000/year). Diarrhea incidence was significantly higher in boys under 5 years (387/1,000/year) than girls under 5 years (309/1,000/year; p < 0.001). Children aged 1 to 2 years had the highest incidence of shigellosis (32/1,000/year). Shigella flexneri was the most common Shigella species isolated and 73% to 95% of these isolates were resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and tetracycline but remain susceptible to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.

V. parahaemolyticus infections were detected sporadically but increased from July 2002 onwards.
CONCLUSION: Diarrhoea causes a heavy public health burden in Jakarta particularly in young children. The impact of shigellosis is exacerbated by the threat of antimicrobial resistance, whereas that of cholera is aggravated by its severe manifestations.","['Agtini MD', 'Soeharno R', 'Lesmana M', 'Punjabi NH', 'Simanjuntak C', 'Wangsasaputra F', 'Nurdin D', 'Pulungsih SP', 'Rofiq A', 'Santoso H', 'Pujarwoto H', 'Sjahrurachman A', 'Sudarmono P', 'von Seidlein L', 'Deen JL', 'Ali M', 'Lee H', 'Kim DR', 'Han O', 'Park JK', 'Suwandono A', 'Ingerani', 'Oyofo BA', 'Campbell JR', 'Beecham HJ', 'Corwin AL', 'Clemens JD']",2005,5,,BMC Infect Dis,"Agtini MD, et al.

16230220,"The epidemiology of travel-associated shigellosis--regional risks, seasonality and serogroups.","OBJECTIVES: To give a detailed risk estimate of contracting travel-associated shigellosis in various regions of the world.
METHODS: Data on notifications of travel-associated shigellosis in Sweden 1997-2003 were compared with information on recent travel abroad from a comprehensive database based on telephone interviews with more than 160,000 Swedish travellers.
RESULTS: From the national notification database 2678 patients with travel-associated shigellosis were retrieved. The highest risk of being notified with shigellosis was seen in returning travellers from India and neighbouring countries (318/100,000 travellers), East Africa (219/100,000), West Africa (120/100,000), and North Africa (76/100,000). Data on serogroup was available for 2529 isolates. Shigella sonnei was the most common serogroup (67%), followed by Shigella flexneri (26%), Shigella boydii (5%), and Shigella dysenteriae (3%). A higher risk was seen in children below the age of six, compared to older children and adults and in women compared to men. A distinct seasonal pattern was noted with the highest risk of shigellosis in July-October and the lowest in May.
CONCLUSIONS: Denominator based data on reported travel-associated infections are well suited to give risk estimates per region of infection, that could be used to target high-risk groups for pre-travel advice.","['Ekdahl K', 'Andersson Y']",2005,51,3,J Infect,"Ekdahl K and Andersson Y.

29208084,Late detection of a shigellosis outbreak in a school in Madrid.,"Even though shigellosis in Spain is rare, an indigenous outbreak is occasionally detected. We describe an outbreak in a school in Madrid caused by person-to-person transmission of Shigella sonnei. After the detection of Shigella sonnei in a stool sample from a 3 year old girl, an investigation at her school was initiated. Questionnaires were distributed to the parents of 520 pupils attending the school. A case was defined as a school case if it was the first case in a child's household, and as a household case if other members of the household had fallen ill first. We identified 88 cases (60 pupils and 28 of their family members). The attack rate (AR) was 12% in the school and 32% in the families. There was a significant association between higher AR and lower age. The outbreak lasted for two months. The length and the shape of the epidemic curve of the 60 cases in pupils suggests person-to-person transmission. Shigella sonnei isolated from 5 different cases were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and was found to be an identical strain. The prolonged duration of the outbreak was probably due to delayed detection, and stopped as soon as control measures were introduced.","['Jonsson J', 'Del Álvarez-Castillo MC', 'Sanz JC', 'Ramiro R', 'Ballester E', 'Fernánez M', 'Echeíta A', 'Martinez Navarro JF']",2005,10,10,Euro Surveill,"Jonsson J, et al.

METHODS: Rabbit models of intestinal invasion induced by Shigella flexneri was established by directly inoculating the bacterium in the colon after cecum bypass operation. The effects of different compositions of Gegenqinlian decoction on the indexes of colitis and the bacterial count of Shigella in the colon content and colon tissue were investigated by orthogonal design.
RESULTS: According to the bacterial count of Shigella in the colon, Coptis chinensis franch and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi are the main effective drugs, but they antagonized each other, so that the best combination protocol was Coptis chinensis Franch only.
CONCLUSION: Among the components of Gegenqinlian decoction, Coptis chinensis franch has the strongest pharmacological effect against bacteria and Glycyrrhina wralensis fisch is the most effective to ameliorate pathological lesions.","['Yu LZ', 'Wu JY', 'Luo JB', 'Chen YR', 'Lin H']",2005,25,9,Di Yi Jun Yi Da Xue Xue Bao,"Yu LZ, et al.

16169130,Immunogenicity of multivalent Shigella-ETEC candidate vaccine strains in a guinea pig model.,"Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli continue to be significant causes of diarrheal disease in infants and young children in developing countries as well as prevalent agents of traveler's diarrhea. A vaccine which provides protection against disease caused by both pathogens would serve common at-risk populations. Such a vaccine would require inclusion of multiple Shigella strains as well as multiple ETEC antigens. The use of attenuated strains of Shigella as live vectors for the expression of ETEC antigens is one strategy for the development of such a multivalent vaccine. Live attenuated strains of S. flexneri 2a, S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae 1 containing deletions in guaBA biosynthetic pathway genes as well as in genes encoding enterotoxins, were constructed. Each strain was subsequently used as a live vector for the expression of one or two critical ETEC antigens. The resulting three Shigella derivative strains were tested for immunogenicty and protective capacity alone or as mixtures in the guinea pig model. S. flexneri strain CVD 1208(pCFA/I-CS3), S. sonnei strain CVD 1233(pCS4-LThK63) and S. dysenteriae 1 strain CVD 1252(pCS2) were able to elicit serum and mucosal antibody responses against the live vector as well as the guest ETEC antigens. Vaccination with combinations of two or three of these strains was able to elicit specific immune responses against each live vector as well as each ETEC antigen represented in the mixture. These studies demonstrate the potential of the use of mixtures of live Shigella derivatives expressing ETEC antigens to serve as an immunogenic multivalent vaccine.","['Barry EM', 'Wang J', 'Wu T', 'Davis T', 'Levine MM']",2006,24,18,Vaccine,"Barry EM, et al.

16162672,The Shigella flexneri effector OspG interferes with innate immune responses by targeting ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.,"Bacteria of Shigella spp. are responsible for shigellosis in humans. They use a type III secretion system to inject effector proteins into host cells and induce their entry into epithelial cells or trigger apoptosis in macrophages. We present evidence that the effector OspG is a protein kinase that binds various ubiquitinylated ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, including UbcH5, which belongs to the stem cell factor SCF(beta-TrCP) complex promoting ubiquitination of phosphorylated inhibitor of NF-kappaB type alpha (phospho-IkappaBalpha). Transfection experiments indicated that OspG can prevent phospho-IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB activation induced by TNF-alpha stimulation. Infection of epithelial cells by the S. flexneri wild-type strain, but not an ospG mutant, led to accumulation of phospho-IkappaBalpha, consistent with OspG inhibiting SCF(beta-TrCP) activity. Upon infection of ileal loops in rabbits, the ospG mutant induced a stronger inflammatory response than the wild-type strain. This finding indicates that OspG negatively controls the host innate response induced by S. flexneri upon invasion of the epithelium.","['Kim DW', 'Lenzen G', 'Page AL', 'Legrain P', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Parsot C']",2005,102,39,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Kim DW, et al.

16159688,Differences in perception of dysentery and enteric fever and willingness to receive vaccines among rural residents in China.,"BACKGROUND: Enteric diseases including dysentery and enteric fever remain significant public health problems in China. While vaccines offer great potential in controlling these diseases, greater understanding of factors influencing acceptance of vaccines is needed to create effective enteric disease control programs in rural China.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional quantitative study with randomly sampled households from two sites in China, one experiencing high rates of shigellosis (Zengding) and the other of typhoid/paratyphoid (Lingchuan).
METHODS: Sociobehavioral survey data were collected through face-to-face interviews from 501 respondents (56% female) in Zhengding regarding dysentery and 624 in Lingchuan (51% female) regarding enteric fever. Vaccine acceptability was measured by expressed need for vaccination and willingness to pay. Comparative and associative analyses were conducted to assess disease perception, vaccination service satisfaction, likelihood of improvements in water and sanitation, and vaccine acceptability.
RESULTS: Nearly all respondents in Lingchuan considered enteric fever to be prevalent in the community, while only one half of the respondents in Zhengding considered dysentery to be problematic (p < 0.01). Nevertheless, more respondents in Zhengding were fearful that a household member would acquire dysentery than were Lingchuan respondents worried that a household member would acquire enteric fever (p < 0.01). Perceived vulnerability of specific subgroups (odds ratios ranging from 1.6 to 8.1), knowing someone who died of the disease (odds ratio reached infinity) and satisfaction with past vaccination services (odds ratios reached infinity) were consistently associated with perceived need for vaccines of target populations of all age groups while the association between perception of sanitary improvement and vaccine need was limited. Perceived need for a vaccine was associated with willingness to pay for the vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions of enhanced vulnerability of specific subgroups to a disease and satisfactory experiences with vaccination services may increase the perceived need for a vaccine, leading to increased willingness to pay for vaccine. Vaccines are not perceived as important for the elderly.","['Chen X', 'Stanton B', 'Wang X', 'Nyamette A', 'Pach A', 'Kaljee L', 'Pack R', 'von Seidlein L', 'Clemens J', 'Gong Y', 'Mao R']",2006,24,5,Vaccine,"Chen X, et al.

In June 2004, an outbreak of shigellosis was confirmed in Abou Shouk camp in the Northern Darfur province of Sudan.

The decision was taken to launch a programme of mass disinfection of all water containers in order to break the contamination cycle. Diarrhoea figures from the clinics showed a fall in cases following the cleaning campaign. It is extremely difficult to obtain good and statistically rigorous data in an emergency setting, the priority being to intervene rapidly to prevent further cases of diarrhoea.

In either the experiment on the ability of intracellular multiplication and cell-to-cell spread in HeLa and U937 cell lines, or the experiment on keratoconjunctivitis in guinea pigs, MTS showed no obvious changes in virulence compared with the parental strain Sf301. When 65 micromol/L DIP was added to the cultured HeLa cells, the ability of intracellular multiplication of MTS reduced about 51.6% as compared with that of Sf301. The analysis of expression profiles under iron-limited condition showed that MTS was more sensitive for the change of iron deficiency than Sf301. There are 106 more up-regulated genes in MTS than in wild-type strains, which are involved in membrane transportation, amino acid metabolism and uncategorized function genes, while down-regulated genes are mainly involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism. Under low iron conditions, the expression levels of known iron-transport associated genes generally increased. Additionally, the number of these genes and their increase amplitude in MTS are more than those in Sf301. Together, these results confirmed that Sit iron-transport system is important for the growth of Shigella.","['Liu M', 'Liu H', 'Sun L', 'Dong J', 'Xue Y', 'Chen S', 'Jin Q']",2005,48,3,Sci China C Life Sci,"Liu M, et al.

16077111,Shigella dysenteriae ShuS promotes utilization of heme as an iron source and protects against heme toxicity.,"Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1, a major cause of bacillary dysentery in humans, can use heme as a source of iron. Genes for the transport of heme into the bacterial cell have been identified, but little is known about proteins that control the fate of the heme molecule after it has entered the cell. The shuS gene is located within the heme transport locus, downstream of the heme receptor gene shuA. ShuS is a heme binding protein, but its role in heme utilization is poorly understood. In this work, we report the construction of a chromosomal shuS mutant. The shuS mutant was defective in utilizing heme as an iron source. At low heme concentrations, the shuS mutant grew slowly and its growth was stimulated by either increasing the heme concentration or by providing extra copies of the heme receptor shuA on a plasmid. At intermediate heme concentrations, the growth of the shuS mutant was moderately impaired, and at high heme concentrations, shuS was required for growth on heme. The shuS mutant did not show increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, even at high heme concentrations. ShuS was also required for optimal utilization of heme under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. These data are consistent with the model in which ShuS binds heme in a soluble, nontoxic form and potentially transfers the heme from the transport proteins in the membrane to either heme-containing or heme-degrading proteins. ShuS did not appear to store heme for future use.","['Wyckoff EE', 'Lopreato GF', 'Tipton KA', 'Payne SM']",2005,187,16,J Bacteriol,"Wyckoff EE, et al.

At one airport, we found that 74% of 13 315 travellers returning with diarrhoea had visited only one country before entering Japan. On the basis of our results, we hypothesized that the international distribution and potential source of bacterial strains could be inferred by analysing strains isolated from travellers returning to Japan. In order to demonstrate the potential for this system, we randomly selected five Shigella sonnei strains and examined their restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns. One set of strains appeared to be closely related, while three sets, isolated from travellers who visited different countries were possibly related. These results suggest that international distributions and potential sources of S. sonnei may be inferred by monitoring isolates from passengers arriving at a Japanese quarantine station.","['Taniguchi H', 'Nakano T', 'Katayama Y', 'Harada F', 'Arai Y', 'Mori K', 'Hirata K', 'Kamiya K', 'Maruyama H', 'Sano K']",2005,133,4,Epidemiol Infect,"Taniguchi H, et al.

16034114,Roles for T and NK cells in the innate immune response to Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri, an enteroinvasive Gram-negative bacterium, is responsible for the worldwide endemic form of bacillary dysentery. The host response to primary infection is characterized by the induction of an acute inflammation, which is accompanied by polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration, resulting in massive destruction of the colonic mucosa. However, PMN play a major role in the recovery from primary infection, by restricting the bacterial infection at the intestinal mucosa. In this study, we assessed the roles for T and NK cells in the control of primary S. flexneri infection, using an alymphoid mouse strain (Rag null gamma(c) null) devoid of B, T, and NK cells. Using the mouse pulmonary model of Shigella infection, we showed that alymphoid Rag null gamma(c) null mice were highly susceptible to S. flexneri infection in comparison with wild-type (wt) mice. Whereas PMN recruitment upon infection was similar, macrophage recruitment and production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in Rag null gamma(c) null mice compared with wt mice. Upon selective engraftment of Rag null gamma(c) null mice with polyclonal alphabeta T cells, but not with alphabeta T cells from IFN-gamma null , S. flexneri infection could be subsequently controlled. Rag null mice devoid of B and T cells but harboring NK cells could control infection. Local IFN-gamma production by T and NK cells recruited to the lung was demonstrated in S. flexneri-infected wt mice. These data demonstrate that both alphabeta T cells and NK cells contribute to the early control of S. flexneri infection through amplification of an inflammatory response. This cellular lymphocyte redundancy assures IFN-gamma production, which is central to innate immunity against Shigella infection.","['Le-Barillec K', 'Magalhaes JG', 'Corcuff E', 'Thuizat A', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Phalipon A', 'Di Santo JP']",2005,175,3,J Immunol,"Le-Barillec K, et al.

16008578,Shigella flexneri infection is dependent on villin in the mouse intestine and in primary cultures of intestinal epithelial cells.,"Villin is an actin-binding protein present in intestinal and kidney brush borders. Villin has been shown to present in vitro Ca(2+)-dependent bundling and severing F-actin properties. The study of villin knock-out mice allowed us to show that while bundling of F-actin microfilaments is unaffected, this protein is important for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton elicited by various signals during both physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we studied the role of villin during infection by Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery. This bacterium induces the reorganization of the host actin cytoskeleton to penetrate into epithelial cells and spread from cell to cell. In vivo, we show that unlike newborn vil+/+ mice, which are sensitive to Shigella invasion, resulting in a destructive inflammatory response of the intestinal mucosa following intragastric inoculation, newborn vil-/- mice appear fully resistant to infection. Using primary cultures of intestinal epithelial cells derived from vil+/+ or vil -/- mice, we demonstrate that villin plays an essential role in S. flexneri entry and cell-to-cell dissemination. Villin expression is thus critical for Shigella infection through its ability to remodel the actin cytoskeleton.","['Athman R', 'Fernandez MI', 'Gounon P', 'Sansonetti P', 'Louvard D', 'Philpott D', 'Robine S']",2005,7,8,Cell Microbiol,"Athman R, et al.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 62 isolates of S. sonnei from sporadic cases of shigellosis in different parts of Malaysia were studied by antimicrobial susceptibility test and PFGE. Approximately 35.5% of the strains showed resistance to three or more antimicrobial agents. Eight resistant phenotypes, i.e. RI to RVIII, was defined. Resistant phenotype RV and RVIII only appeared in year 2000. PFGE analysis with NotI and XbaI restriction showed that a great heterogeneity existed at the DNA level among Malaysian S. sonnei isolates. Fifty-eight NotI and 61 XbaI-PFGE profiles were observed in 63 S. sonnei isolates, including ATCC 11060 isolate. Drug sensitive isolates displayed very different profiles from drug-resistant isolates, with a few exceptions. Isolates of resistant phenotype RVI (SXTr.TETr.STRr) showed a greater similarity among each other compared with isolates of resistant phenotype RI and drug-sensitive isolates.
CONCLUSION: Multi-drug-resistant S. sonnei were circulated in different parts of Malaysia and the emergence of new resistant phenotype was observed. Wide genetic variations among Malaysian S. sonnei were observed and the drug-sensitive strains could be differentiated from drug-resistant strains by PFGE.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study verifies the usefulness of PFGE in characterizing and comparing strains of S. sonnei.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2002 and March 2003 at Aga Khan University on stool samples received from children with diarrhoea and dysentery from four low socio-economic areas (Sultanabad, Rehri Goth, Hijrat and Sherpao colony) of Karachi. Stool samples yielding growth of Shigella species, were further identified for serotypes by slide agglutination. Antibiotics susceptibility was performed by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method.
RESULTS: Out of 4688 stool samples received, 193 (4.1%) were positive for Shigella species. Shigella flexneri was the predominant serogroup (58%) followed by Shigella sonnei (16%), Shigella boydii (15%) and Shigella dysentriae being the least common (11%). A number of serotypes were isolated in each serogroup, 8 serotypes in S. flexneri, 8 serotypes in S. dysenteriae, 9 serotypes in S. boydii, and Phase 1 & 2 were found in S. sonnei. 17% isolates remained non-serotypeable. All isolates were susceptible to Ofloxacin and Ceftriaxone, high rate of resistance was observed in Cotrimoxazole (87.75%) and Ampicillin (55.5%). Emerging resistance against Nalidixic acid (39%) was observed.
CONCLUSION: Shigella still accounts for a significant proportion of bacillary dysentery in many tropical and subtropical countries. Serotype identification can help in devising strategies such as development of effective vaccine for controlling this problem. Increasing antibiotic resistance against commonly prescribed drugs signify that treatment options have become difficult in cases of severe dysentery.","['Zafar A', 'Sabir N', 'Bhutta ZA']",2005,55,5,J Pak Med Assoc,"Zafar A, et al.

One hundred eighty-two children in two elementary schools in Yu-Li, Taiwan, where an outbreak occurred after a typhoon hit this area in 2001, were enrolled in this study. Clinical and epidemiologic data on the infected children were collected. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on the isolates to determine the genetic relatedness of outbreak strains. Plasmid analysis and PCR were performed to identify beta-lactamase genes responsible for ceftriaxone resistance. Forty-seven children from the two elementary schools were culture positive for S. sonnei in this outbreak. Twenty-three children were asymptomatic. Of the total isolates 55.3% were resistant to ampicillin. One hundred percent of the isolates obtained from children in school A were initially susceptible to both ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Of isolates obtained from school B 96.2% were nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone. However, two isolates from school A developed resistance to ampicillin during the course of treatment. All 18 available isolates showed closely related PFGE patterns (4, 4a, 4b, and 4c). CMY-2-type AmpC beta-lactamase was responsible for ceftriaxone resistance in ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible isolates; Southern blot hybridization confirmed that such a resistance gene was located on the plasmid.

Here, we show that one of the effectors, IpaH9.8, plays a role in modulating inflammatory responses to Shigella infection. In murine lung infection model, DeltaipaH9.8 mutant caused more severe inflammatory responses with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production levels than did wild-type Shigella, which resulted in a 30-fold decrease in bacterial colonization. Binding assays revealed that IpaH9.8 has a specific affinity to U2AF(35), a mammalian splicing factor, which interferes with U2AF(35)-dependent splicing as assayed for IgM pre-mRNA. Reducing the U2AF(35) level in HeLa cells and infecting HeLa cells with wild-type caused a decrease in the expression of the il-8, RANTES, GM-CSF, and il-1beta genes as examined by RT-PCR.

15950082,Epidemic strain Shigella dysenteriae Type 1 Dt66 encodes several drug resistances by chromosome.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 were isolated from an epidemic in West Bengal, India (1984). During the past two decades, much attention was given to reevaluation of treatment recommendations. However, there are no useful data on drug resistance encoded by chromosome.
METHODS: A total of 300 strains of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 were isolated from an epidemic. Strains were biochemically identified by API 20E system and further confirmed serologically. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method and plasmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis procedure. Elimination of plasmids was achieved by curing with acridine orange from a representative epidemic strain S. dysenteriae 1 Dt66. PFGE was performed for typing of wild-type and plasmid-cured strains. Southern blot of PFGE separated XbaI digested chromosomal DNA was done onto positively charged nylon membrane. For Southern hybridization, plasmid DNA was used as probe.
RESULTS: All isolates showed identical drug resistance patterns and plasmid profiles. All these isolates contained six plasmids ranging in sizes from 3 to 145 kb. We have eliminated all the plasmids from a representative strain of S. dysenteriae 1 Dt66 by using acridine orange as curing agent. All epidemic Shigella isolates were resistant to amoxycillin, ampicillin, bacitracin, carbenicillin, cefixime, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, methicillin, penicillin G, polymixin B, streptomycin, rifampicin, tetracycline and vancomycin, among 29 antibiotics used. Out of 17 resistant antibiotics, 12 were encoded by chromosome. Resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline and ceftazidime was plasmid encoded. Southern blot hybridization showed the recognition of two clear sites in the chromosome used plasmid DNA of Dt66 strain as probe, which reveled some sequential genetic homology between chromosome and plasmids. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed for typing of the chromosome of plasmidless strains of Dt66 and wild-type strain Dt66 (having plasmids) that remain unaltered.

METHODS: By using a host-plasmid balanced lethal system based on asd gene, a polyvalent recombinant strain was constructed to highly express CS3 and regularly express fusion enterotoxin of LTB subunit and mutant ST (LTB/STm) in a vaccine strain Shigella flexneri 2a T32 with specific deletion of asd gene. Fimbria CS3 was observed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy assay. The security of LTB/STm was examined by ileal loop assay and suckling mouse assay. To evaluate this new candidate vaccine, it was compared with a previous vaccine strain in plasmid and protein level, growth assay and immunogenicity in Balb/c mice.
RESULTS: The newly constructed vaccine expressed CS3 and grew better than the previously constructed vaccine except for the lower expression of LTB/STm.

15942903,Mucosal lymphoid infiltrate dominates colonic pathological changes in murine experimental shigellosis.,"BACKGROUND: Shigella species are invasive human pathogens that cause acute rectocolitis by triggering a dysregulated inflammatory reaction in the colonic and rectal mucosa. Because mice are naturally resistant to shigellosis, there is no mouse model that mimics human disease. We explore the susceptibility of intestinal flora-depleted mice to shigellosis after intragastric infection with Shigella strains.
METHODS: Mice given 5 g/L streptomycin as a beverage were infected intragastrically with 1 x 108 cfu of either invasive or noninvasive Shigella strains.
RESULTS: We found that invasive Shigella strains persist up to 30 days in feces, whereas the persistence of noninvasive Shigella strains was reduced. Colonization primarily involves the colon and the cecum and, to a lesser extent, the ileum. The hallmark of inflammation in the intestinal tissue is a dramatic expansion of the lymphoid follicles, in which a high apoptotic index is recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a murine model in which shigellae are able to reach their natural tissue target: the colon. Moreover, the absence of polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment and of epithelial cell lesions reveal some aspects of shigellosis that are usually hidden by the prevalence of this cell population. This novel model may contribute to the identification of new targets for vaccines and therapies.","['Martino MC', 'Rossi G', 'Martini I', 'Tattoli I', 'Chiavolini D', 'Phalipon A', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Bernardini ML']",2005,192,1,J Infect Dis,"Martino MC, et al.

15933557,Antimicrobial-resistant Shigella sonnei: limited antimicrobial treatment options for children and challenges of interpreting in vitro azithromycin susceptibility.,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial-resistant Shigella sonnei is a growing problem in the United States and poses treatment challenges particularly among children. Azithromycin is recommended as an alternative oral agent for shigellosis.
METHODS: All isolates of Shigella submitted to Johns Hopkins clinical laboratory during the outbreak year (2002) were compared with a historical comparison group (1996-2000). Isolates were considered multiresistant if they were resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS). Selected outbreak and reference isolates were tested for azithromycin susceptibility by E-test, disk diffusion and broth dilution methods.
RESULTS: Between 1996-2000, among the 111 isolates submitted, 63% were from pediatric patients; 63% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin and 12% to TS. In 2002, among the 205 isolates submitted, 82% were from pediatric patients; 91% isolates were resistant to ampicillin and 67% to TS. The proportion of multiresistant isolates increased from 6% in 1996 to 65% in 2002 (P < 0.05). Azithromycin susceptibility by E-test and disk diffusion demonstrated 2 zones of inhibition for S. sonnei. Interpretation using the inner zone resulted in higher MICs (minimal inhibitory concentration) compared with the outer zones by E-test (P < 0.0001) and disk diffusion (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: With increasing interest in using azithromycin for shigellosis, clinical laboratories should be aware of the interpretation difficulty caused by the dual-zone phenomenon seen with E-test and disk diffusion methods for S. sonnei.","['Jain SK', 'Gupta A', 'Glanz B', 'Dick J', 'Siberry GK']",2005,24,6,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Jain SK, et al.

In simple correlation, cases of salmonellosis, erysipelas, infectious mononucleosis and toxoplasmosis were positively correlated with the winter NAO index, while hepatitis A and shigellosis were negatively correlated, and the other diseases tested (rubella, mumps, chickenpox, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme borreliosis, leptospirosis, tularemia and scarlet fever) were uncorrelated with NAO. However, 8 of the 14 diseases also revealed a significant time trend, either increasing (infectious mononucleosis, salmonellosis, erysipelas, toxoplasmosis) or decreasing (hepatitis A, scarlet fever, leptospirosis, shigellosis) during the period. When the effect of NAO on incidence of the diseases was then controlled for calendar year using partial correlation analysis and detrended regression, only toxoplasmosis and infectious mononucleosis were found significantly positively correlated with the NAO when the index was lagged 1 or 2 years, and leptospirosis was correlated negatively with a lag of 2 years.

Transit of translocator and effector proteins through the TTS apparatus is activated upon contact of bacteria with host cells. Transcription of approximately 15 genes encoding effectors is regulated by the TTS apparatus activity and controlled by MxiE, an AraC family activator, and its coactivator IpgC, the chaperone of IpaB and IpaC translocators.

The stimulated macrophages were co-cultured with primed or non-primed T-cells from Shigella infected patients. T-cell cultures were also established by co-culturing KSD1 coupled with or without PHA stimulated macrophages. Emulsified KSD1 coupled with anti-IFN-gamma antibody was found to act as a potent immunogen, inducing the release of Th1 cytokine from primed T-cells cultured in acute stage of the disease. It was observed that the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2 production rather than IL-4 and IL-6 were increased as the disease became more severe. On comparison, the subsequent values of IL-6, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-2 were found to be less significant in healthy primed T-cell cultures. This was also associated with a substantial production of superoxide ions (O2-), which probably inhibits the colonization of intracellular Shigella due to the presence of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies. On the other hand KSD1 with or without PHA failed to induce such responses. The above findings reflect that in the presence of anti-IFN-gamma antibody, KSD1 acts as a potential immunogen for eliciting cellular immunity against shigellosis.","['Sinha AK', 'Bagchi AK']",2005,31,2,Cytokine,Sinha AK and Bagchi AK.

15880088,Shigellosis.,"Shigellosis is a global human health problem. Four species of Shigella i.e. S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei are able to cause the disease. These species are subdivided into serotypes on the basis of O-specific polysaccharide of the LPS. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 produces severe disease and may be associated with life-threatening complications. The symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhoea and/or dysentery with frequent mucoid bloody stools, abdominal cramps and tenesmus. Shigella spp. cause dysentery by invading the colonic mucosa. Shigella bacteria multiply within colonic epithelial cells, cause cell death and spread laterally to infect and kill adjacent epithelial cells, causing mucosal ulceration, inflammation and bleeding. Transmission usually occurs via contaminated food and water or through person-to-person contact. Laboratory diagnosis is made by culturing the stool samples using selective/differential agar media. Shigella spp. are highly fragile organism and considerable care must be exercised in collecting faecal specimens, transporting them to the laboratories and in using appropriate media for isolation. Antimicrobial agents are the mainstay of therapy of all cases of shigellosis. Due to the global emergence of drug resistance, the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating shigellosis is limited. Although single dose of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective, they are currently less effective against S. dysenteriae type 1 infection. Newer quinolones, cephalosporin derivatives, and azithromycin are the drug of choice. However, fluoroquinolone-resistant S. dysenteriae type 1 infection have been reported. Currently, no vaccines against Shigella infection exist. Both live and subunit parenteral vaccine candidates are under development. Because immunity to Shigella is serotype-specific, the priority is to develop vaccine against S. dysenteriae type 1 and S. flexneri type 2a. Shigella species are important pathogens responsible for diarrhoeal diseases and dysentery occurring all over the world. The morbidity and mortality due to shigellosis are especially high among children in developing countries. A recent review of literature (Kotloff et al.,1999) concluded that, of the estimated 165 million cases of Shigella diarrhoea that occur annually, 99% occur in developing countries, and in developing countries 69% of episodes occur in children under five years of age. Moreover, of the ca.1.1 million deaths attributed to Shigella infections in developing countries, 60% of deaths occur in the under-five age group. Travellers from developed to developing regions and soldiers serving under field conditions are also at an increased risk to develop shigellosis.",['Niyogi SK'],2005,43,2,J Microbiol,Niyogi SK.

15849186,IpgB1 is a novel Shigella effector protein involved in bacterial invasion of host cells. Its activity to promote membrane ruffling via Rac1 and Cdc42 activation.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, is capable of inducing the large scale membrane ruffling required for the bacterial invasion of host cells. Shigella secrete a subset of effectors via the type III secretion system (TTSS) into the host cells to induce membrane ruffling. Here, we show that IpgB1 is secreted via the TTSS into epithelial cells and plays a major role in producing membrane ruffles via stimulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities, thus promoting bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. The invasiveness of the ipgB1 mutant was decreased to less than 50% of the wild-type level (100%) in a gentamicin protection or plaque forming assay. HeLa cells infected with the wild-type or a IpgB1-hyperproducing strain developed membrane ruffles, with the invasiveness and the scale of membrane ruffles being comparable with the level of IpgB1 production in bacteria. Upon expression of EGFP-IpgB1 in HeLa cells, large membrane ruffles are extended, where the EGFP-IpgB1 was predominantly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. The IpgB1-mediated formation of ruffles was significantly diminished by expressing Rac1 small interfering RNA and Cdc42 small interfering RNA or by treatment with GGTI-298, an inhibitor of the geranylgeranylation of Rho GTPases. When IpgB1 was expressed in host cells or wild-type Shigella-infected host cells, Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated. The results thus indicate that IpgB1 is a novel Shigella effector involved in bacterial invasion of epithelial cells via the activation of Rho GTPases.","['Ohya K', 'Handa Y', 'Ogawa M', 'Suzuki M', 'Sasakawa C']",2005,280,25,J Biol Chem,"Ohya K, et al.

15837361,Considerations for development of whole cell bacterial vaccines to prevent diarrheal diseases in children in developing countries.,"Enteric pathogens constitute a major pediatric threat in the developing world through their impact on morbidity and mortality, physical and cognitive development and cause and effect relationship with malnutrition. Although many bacterial pathogens can cause diarrheal diseases, a group of less than 10 including Shigella spp., enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Vibrio cholerae, and possibly, Campylobacter jejuni account for a significant percentage of these diseases in developing countries. Rotavirus is also a major cause of diarrheal diseases. Vaccines against these agents offer a potentially effective control measure against these diseases, but safe, practical, and effective vaccines for many of these agents have yet to be realized. Many vaccine development approaches are under investigation, but the one that is currently most advanced and that has been most widely applied to enteric pathogens is the use of orally administered live or killed whole pathogen preparations. If inactivated, these vaccines will probably be administered as multiple doses with approximately 10(10) to 10(11) total particles per dose, but they are relatively safe for oral administration. Further, they may not require a buffer for delivery and can be stored in liquid formulations. Fewer doses may be required for some live attenuated pathogen vaccines, but a buffer will most likely be required for oral delivery and the product must be stored in a dried formulation. Also, safety becomes more of a concern with live pathogens depending on the degree of attenuation, host immunocompetence, and the total number and kinds of attenuated pathogens which may be present in a combined agent vaccine. Both live and killed whole pathogen vaccines can be immunogenic and have the possibility to serve as vectors for other antigens. Although many organisms and serotypes are clinically important, by exploiting antigenic cross reactivity and using some pathogen components as vectors for cloned antigens of other pathogens, it could be possible to induce immunity against major enteric pathogens/serotypes with <10 whole pathogen components in a multi-agent vaccine. Safe and effective mucosal adjuvants may in the future be useful in whole pathogen vaccines, but they do not seem to be essential for immunization. Further, dietary supplements such as zinc, mixed routes of delivery and new regimens are under study which may in the future enhance further the effectiveness of the whole pathogen vaccines which now seem realizable in the near term. For this to happen, however, a coordinated and committed effort is necessary now to address the immunologic, regulatory, manufacturing, testing and implementation issues which will be involved in the realization of this important product to benefit children's health worldwide.",['Walker RI'],2005,23,26,Vaccine,Walker RI.

15825022,Shigella sonnei meningitis due to interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 deficiency: first association with a primary immune deficiency.,"BACKGROUND: Inherited interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) deficiency is a recently described immunodeficiency associated with pyogenic bacterial infections and a poor inflammatory response. Shigella sonnei is generally associated with outbreaks of rectocolitis in developed countries, but systemic illnesses have occasionally been reported. An underlying primary immunodeficiency has not been found in such cases before now.
METHODS: We report the clinical and immunological features of a patient with IRAK-4 deficiency who has a history of systemic shigellosis in addition to other infections.
RESULTS: The patient has a history of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections during childhood and an episode of S. sonnei septicemia and meningitis at 10 years of age. This patient's history contrasted with that of other individuals infected concurrently by the same organism. Of note, these episodes were not accompanied by acute phase responses in our patient. Subsequently, the patient has had more episodes of staphylococcal disease, but no systemic illnesses. The patient is now 30 years old and has been doing well since prophylactic antibiotic treatment was stopped 4 years ago.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of systemic shigellosis in a person with a primary immunodeficiency, expanding the spectrum of infections associated with IRAK-4 deficiency. Thus, immunity mediated by IRAK-4 seems to be crucial for both the containment of and the inflammatory response to S. sonnei infection in the intestinal mucosa.

15824427,Isolation and characterization of provisional serovar Shigella boydii E16553 from diarrhoeal patients in Bangladesh.,"In previous studies with strains of the Shigella dysenteriae provisional serovars E22383 and E23507 from diarrhoeal stools from patients in Bangladesh, two strains of Shigella species were identified as Shigella boydii provisional serovar E16553 by a reference laboratory. Further tests with an antiserum to an international type strain of the provisional serovar E16553 identified an additional 15 isolates. None of the isolates reacted with antisera to the established Shigella serovars or any other provisional serovars reported so far and all showed biochemical reactions typical of S. boydii. All of the isolates harboured the 140 MDa invasion plasmid, had the ipaH gene and produced keratoconjunctivitis in the guinea pig eye. All isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and mecillinam but eight strains were resistant to tetracycline. A single PFGE type (type A) was shown for all 17 clinical isolates, indicating a common source of origin. The pulsotype of the Bangladeshi isolates was closely related to that of a Japanese strain but was different from that of the type strain. On the basis of these biochemical, serological and virulence markers, and diverse geographical origin, it is recommended that the provisional status of serovar E16553 be changed and that it be included in the international serotyping classification scheme as S. boydii 19.","['Ansaruzzaman M', 'Sultana M', 'Talukder KA', 'Alam K', 'Matsushita S', 'Safa A', 'Khajanchi BK', 'Dutta DK', 'Islam Z', 'Albert MJ', 'Nair GB', 'Sack DA']",2005,54,Pt 5,J Med Microbiol,"Ansaruzzaman M, et al.

15790294,Molecular evolution of the lysine decarboxylase-defective phenotype in Shigella sonnei.,"Shigella, the etiological agent of the bacillary dysentery, belongs to the extremely diverse species of Escherichia coli. In the evolutionary route of Shigella from commensal E. coli ancestors towards a pathogenic lifestyle, the critical events have been the acquisition of the pINV plasmid, through horizontal transfer and the inactivation of pre-existing genes. These so-called pathoadaptive mutations affect the expression of genes negatively interfering with the newly acquired functions necessary for the colonization of the host niche. Cadaverine, a small polyamine resulting from decarboxylation of lysine, has been shown to hamper the full expression of Shigella invasiveness mainly by altering the inflammatory response. Recent analysis of the evolution of the Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) cad region indicates that silencing of the cad locus has been attained with several strategies. The increasing relevance of S. sonnei in both, developing and industrial countries, prompted us to analyze the molecular origin of the LDC- phenotype in these strains. The results obtained on several S. sonnei strains reveal that despite the difference in geographic origin and antibiotic resistance patterns, all the strains have undergone the same modifications. Multiple IS insertions into the cadBA operon have interrupted gene continuity without inducing deletions or inversions of the cadA and cadB genes which are remained entirely conserved. Moreover, by functional analysis we show that all the strains carry a defective cadC gene, thus strengthening the hypothesis that inactivation of the regulatory cadC gene might have been the first step towards a complete lack of the cad locus.","['Casalino M', 'Latella MC', 'Prosseda G', 'Ceccarini P', 'Grimont F', 'Colonna B']",2005,294,8,Int J Med Microbiol,"Casalino M, et al.

This retrospective study was conducted on the strains isolated between 1995 and 1999 by examination of faeces for bacterial pathogens. the susceptibility of the strains to antibiotics was studied by disc diffusion test with Mueller Hinton agar, and detection of extended broad spectrum beta-lactamase. Shigella dysenteriae-1 represented 45.18 % of Shigella strains and was particularly isolated in winter season (from August to September), more frequently in men (sex ratio: 2 / 1). Among the strains, 72 % were resistant to beta-lactams, and the ratio of multiresistant strains represented 42 %, concerning cotrimoxazol, chloramphenicol, tetracyclin and aminopenicillins.

15773990,"Frameshifting by transcriptional slippage is involved in production of MxiE, the transcription activator regulated by the activity of the type III secretion apparatus in Shigella flexneri.","Bacteria of Shigella spp. are responsible for shigellosis in humans. They use a type III secretion (TTS) system encoded by a 200 kb virulence plasmid to enter epithelial cells and trigger apoptosis in macrophages. This TTS system comprises a secretion apparatus, translocators and effectors that transit through this apparatus, cytoplasmic chaperones and specific transcription regulators. The TTS apparatus assembled during growth of Shigella flexneri in broth is activated upon contact with epithelial cells. Transcription of approximately 15 genes encoding effectors, including IpaH proteins, is regulated by the TTS apparatus activity and controlled by MxiE, a transcription activator of the AraC family, and IpgC, the chaperone of the translocators IpaB and IpaC. We present evidence that MxiE is produced by a frameshift between a 59-codon open reading frame (ORF) (mxiEa) containing the translation start site and a 214-codon ORF (mxiEb) encoding the DNA binding domain of the protein. The mxiEa encoded N-terminal part of MxiE is required for MxiE function. Frameshifting efficiency was approximately 30% during growth in broth and was not modulated by the activity of secretion or the coactivator IpgC. Frameshifting involves slippage of RNA polymerase during transcription of mxiE, which results in the incorporation of one additional nucleotide in the mRNA and places mxiEa and mxiEb in the same reading frame. Frameshifting might represent an additional means of controlling gene expression under specific environmental conditions.","['Penno C', 'Sansonetti P', 'Parsot C']",2005,56,1,Mol Microbiol,"Penno C, et al.

15771176,Comparative analysis of Shigella boydii 18 foodborne outbreak isolate and related enteric bacteria: role of rpoS and adiA in acid stress response.,"Shigella boydii CDPH (Chicago Department of Public Health) serotype 18 was implicated in an outbreak of foodborne illness in 1998. The suspected food vehicles were parsley and cilantro imported from Mexico used to prepare bean salad. Previous studies revealed that S. boydii CDPH serotype 18 can survive in bean salad, which contains organic acids and whose pH decreases over time. Acid challenge assays in acidified tryptic soy broth at pH 4.5, acidified Luria-Bertani broth at pH 4.5, and acidified M9 minimal salts medium at pH 2.5 containing amino acids, arginine, or glutamic acid were performed using S. boydii CDPH, S. boydii ATCC 35966, S. flexneri 3136, Escherichia coli O157:H7 dd8872, and E. coli O157:H7 dd642 to compare differences in acid tolerance. Differences in survival of exponential-phase cells were detected in acidified tryptic soy broth and Luria-Bertani broth at pH 4.5. In acidified minimal medium containing arginine, S. boydii strains were able to survive at pH 2.5. The arginine decarboxylase gene (adiA) present in S. boydii is involved in survival at extremely low pH. The discovery of adiA expression in S. boydii serotype 18 by use of an acidified minimal medium challenge and arginine decarboxylase biochemical assay is significant because arginine decarboxylase activity was thought to be unique to E. coli. Sequencing of the rpoS gene from the S. boydii outbreak strain indicates that it is 99% conserved compared with the E. coli K-12 rpoS gene and plays a vital role in survival under acidic conditions.","['Chan YC', 'Blaschek HP']",2005,68,3,J Food Prot,Chan YC and Blaschek HP.

15764200,Presumptive shigellosis: clinical and laboratory characteristics of Bangladeshi patients.,"The aim of the study was to examine some selected clinical and laboratory parameters in distinguishing non-Shigella invasive diarrhoeas from culture-confirmed Shigella cases. We conducted a clinic-based, cross-sectional study at the Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR,B located in Bangladesh. In total, 389 patients of all age groups and of both genders, with a history of diarrhoea of less than 96 h and presence of visible blood and/or mucus in the stool were presumed to have shigellosis and enrolled in the study. Shigella was isolated from faecal cultures in 227 (58.4%) patients. The remaining 162 (41.6%) patients did not have Shigella isolated from their faecal cultures and constituted the comparison group. Another 238 randomly selected patients with non-Shigella diarrhoea from the Diarrhoeal Disease Surveillance System database of the Dhaka Hospital constituted another comparison group. Cases of culture-proven Shigella were similar to non-Shigella invasive diarrhoeal patients with presumptive shigellosis with regard to several biosocial variables. The nutritional status of children with shigellosis was significantly inferior to those with non-Shigella diarrhoea. The presence of macrophages more than 5/HPF in stool microscopic examination was significantly more frequent among patients infected with Shigella. Empirical antimicrobial therapy for shigellosis might be considered for malnourished diarrhoeal children presenting with history of visible blood and/or mucus in stool, and children older than 1 y of age.

15750107,Molecular epidemiology of Shigella flexneri in a long-stay psychiatric nursing center during 2001 to 2003.,"With six separate wards accommodating more than 1,600 patients, V Nursing Center (VNC) is a long-stay psychiatric nursing center in eastern Taiwan. During 2001 to 2003, 39 shigellosis cases occurred in VNC. Different from the notion that most cases of shigellosis are caused by Shigella sonnei, all except one of these cases were caused by S. flexneri, with the remaining one caused by an S. sonnei isolate. O-antigen serotyping showed that the 38 S. flexneri strains were of either type 1a (n = 20) or 4a (n = 18), two less prevalent serotypes in Taiwan. NotI-based pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses performed with 8 type 1a non-VNC strains and 9 type 4a non-VNC strains isolated from 1996 to 2003 for comparison divided the 28 type 1a strains and the 27 type 4a strains into 7 and 10 subtypes, designated subtypes P1A to P1G and subtypes P4A to P4J, respectively. Subtypes P1A and P4A, which appeared in three consecutive years in VNC as well as outside of VNC, are the most prevalent subtypes. Analyses of the relatedness of the VNC strains on the basis of the banding patterns grouped the type 1a and 4a strains into four and five clusters, respectively. All except one of the type 1a strains had 95% similarity, indicating that they had a common parent, whereas the type 4a strains had similarities that ranged from 77 to 93%, suggesting that they were of diverse origins. In two of the outbreaks, less related subtypes of the type 4a strains were found in the same VNC wards in consecutive years, suggesting the possible existence of different subtypes in VNC all the time. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that all except one of the S. flexneri strains were sensitive to at least seven antibiotics; the remaining isolate was sensitive to three antibiotics. The data from the latter tests should be helpful for selection of proper treatments for S. flexneri infections in Taiwan.","['Lee YS', 'Liu MC', 'Ko CF', 'Lu CH', 'Tseng YH']",2005,43,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Lee YS, et al.

Updated susceptibility knowledge is necessary for appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment.
METHODS: In this study the clinical characteristics and the antibiotic susceptibility test results of Shigella species isolated from patients admitted to Hacettepe University Ihsan Dogramac Children's Hospital Diarrheal Diseases Training and Treatment Unit between 1995-2002 (n = 218) were evaluated. The results were compared with the results of 1987-1994 from the same center (n = 618).
RESULTS: The predominant species was S. sonnei in both periods with increasing prevalence in the later period (64% and 71.5% respectively, P < 0.05). Although the prevalence of bloody diarrhea among Shigella cases did not change between periods, the prevalence of mild to moderate dehydration (11% and 20.6%) increased. Approximately 40% of cases were prescribed antibiotics on the suspicion of shigellosis. When the two periods were compared, Shigella resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole increased from 39% to 70% (P < 0.0001), whereas resistance to ampicillin decreased from 41% to 23% (P < 0.0001). However, the resistance of S. flexneri to ampicillin was found to be quite high (72.9%) between 1995-2002. No Shigella species resistant to ciprofloxacin was detected. Multi-drug resistance was present in 52 (24%) of the cases, of which 10 were S. sonnei (6.3%) and 42 S. flexneri (26.4%) (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The need to treat all Shigella cases in areas where S. sonnei is predominant should be reevaluated, as should the appropriate empirical antibiotic.","['Ozmert EN', 'Göktürk B', 'Yurdakök K', 'Yalçin SS', 'Gür D']",2005,40,3,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Ozmert EN, et al.

15731456,Optimization of virulence functions through glucosylation of Shigella LPS.,"Shigella, the leading cause of bacillary dysentery, uses a type III secretion system (TTSS) to inject proteins into human cells, leading to bacterial invasion and a vigorous inflammatory response. The bacterium is protected against the response by the O antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on its surface. We show that bacteriophage-encoded glucosylation of Shigella O antigen, the basis of different serotypes, shortens the LPS molecule by around half. This enhances TTSS function without compromising the protective properties of the LPS. Thus, LPS glucosylation promotes bacterial invasion and evasion of innate immunity, which may have contributed to the emergence of serotype diversity in Shigella.","['West NP', 'Sansonetti P', 'Mounier J', 'Exley RM', 'Parsot C', 'Guadagnini S', 'Prévost MC', 'Prochnicka-Chalufour A', 'Delepierre M', 'Tanguy M', 'Tang CM']",2005,307,5713,Science,"West NP, et al.

The laboratory had capability to detect many different disease agents, especially those causing febrile illness. Diarrheal stool diagnostic evaluation included plating and biochemical identification, antigen serologic testing, fluorescent antibody antigen detection, disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing, enzyme immunoassay, and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for norovirus (NV). Confirmation and sequencing work for NV was done at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Ohio).
RESULTS: By far the most common reason for infectious disease sick call visits was gastrointestinal illness; no other symptoms had equivalent impact. An enteropathogen was detected in 57 (44%) of 129 stool samples, with NV detected in 30 stool samples (23%) obtained from 14 different battalion or similar-sized units; next in frequency were Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei, which were isolated from 26 stool samples (20%) obtained from 15 units. Sequencing the NV RNA polymerase gene demonstrated that NV strains represented 7 genetic clusters, including 2 strains from genogroup I and 5 from genogroup II. Ciprofloxacin was effective in vitro against most bacterial agents, but neither doxycyline (which was taken daily as the antimalarial prophylaxis dose) nor trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple strains of Shigella species and NV predominated, probably because they do not require a large inoculum to cause infection. Otherwise, personnel remained free of infectious illness during this phase of the conflict, because other infectious agents were rare or absent.","['Thornton SA', 'Sherman SS', 'Farkas T', 'Zhong W', 'Torres P', 'Jiang X']",2005,40,4,Clin Infect Dis,"Thornton SA, et al.

15707504,Detection of virulence genes in Malaysian Shigella species by multiplex PCR assay.,"BACKGROUND: In Malaysia, Shigella spp. was reported to be the third commonest bacterial agent responsible for childhood diarrhoea. Currently, isolation of the bacterium and confirmation of the disease by microbiological and biochemical methods remain as the ""gold standard"". This study aimed to detect the prevalence of four Shigella virulence genes present concurrently, in randomly selected Malaysian strains via a rapid multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay.
METHODS: A mPCR assay was designed for the simultaneous detection of chromosomal- and plasmid-encoded virulence genes (set1A, set1B, ial and ipaH) in Shigella spp. One hundred and ten Malaysian strains (1997-2000) isolated from patients from various government hospitals were used. Reproducibility and sensitivity of the assay were also evaluated. Applicability of the mPCR in clinical settings was tested with spiked faeces following preincubation in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth.
RESULTS: The ipaH sequence was present in all the strains, while each of the set1A, set1B and ial gene was present in 40% of the strains tested. Reproducibility of the mPCR assay was 100% and none of the non-Shigella pathogens tested in this study were amplified. The mPCR could detect 100 colony-forming units (cfu) of shigellae per reaction mixture in spiked faeces following preincubation.
CONCLUSIONS: The mPCR system is reproducible, sensitive and is able to identify pathogenic strains of shigellae irrespective of the locality of the virulence genes. It can be easily performed with a high throughput to give a presumptive identification of the causal pathogen.","['Thong KL', 'Hoe SL', 'Puthucheary SD', 'Yasin R']",2005,5,,BMC Infect Dis,"Thong KL, et al.

15699240,Effects of zinc supplementation as adjunct therapy on the systemic immune responses in shigellosis.,"BACKGROUND: Zinc is lost during diarrheal diseases, and zinc deficiency induces intestinal morphology-altering inflammatory responses that zinc supplementation can correct.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the in vivo effect of zinc supplementation on systemic and mucosal responses in mildly to moderately malnourished (defined as <-1 but >-2 and <-2 but >-3 weight-for-height z scores, respectively, based on the National Center for Health Statistics growth reference) children with shigellosis.
DESIGN: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Shigella flexneri-infected children aged 12-59 mo. Daily for 14 d, elemental zinc (20 mg) and multivitamins (vitamins A and D, thiamine, riboflavin, and nicotinamide) plus calcium were given at twice the US recommended dietary allowance to the zinc group (n=28), and multivitamins plus calcium were given to the control group (n=28). All subjects received standard antibiotic therapy.
RESULTS: There was no significant interaction between zinc supplementation and time, but zinc supplementation showed a significant effect on serum zinc concentrations. With a >or=4-fold increase in serum shigellacidal antibody titers from baseline used as the cutoff, the proportion of children with shigellacidal antibody response was greater in the zinc group than in the control group (P<0.03). There was a significant (P=0.02) treatment x time interaction for the proportions of circulating CD20+ and CD20+CD38+ cells, which were higher on day 7 in the zinc group than in the control group (P<0.007). No effect was seen on histopathologic features or the expression of innate and inflammatory mediators in the rectum.
CONCLUSION: Adjunct therapy with zinc during acute shigellosis significantly improved seroconversion to shigellacidal antibody response and increased the proportions of circulating B lymphocytes and plasma cells.","['Rahman MJ', 'Sarker P', 'Roy SK', 'Ahmad SM', 'Chisti J', 'Azim T', 'Mathan M', 'Sack D', 'Andersson J', 'Raqib R']",2005,81,2,Am J Clin Nutr,"Rahman MJ, et al.

15695673,A novel Shigella dysenteriae serovar isolated in Canada.,"The etiological agent most commonly associated with bacillary dysentery is Shigella. As part of its mandate, the Bacteriology and Enteric Disease Program of Health Canada identifies and serotypes unusual isolates of Shigella received from provincial laboratories of public health. In this report, six unusual isolates from three provinces were analyzed biochemically and serologically using slide and tube agglutinations and molecularly using standard pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) techniques. All six isolates were identical. PFGE analysis grouped these strains; biochemically, they were mannitol negative and consistent with the profile of Shigella. Serologically, these strains produced weak reactions in Shigella dysenteriae serovars 4 and 16 and Escherichia coli O159 and O173 antisera. Molecular serotyping by PCR-RFLP of the rfb gene produced an S. dysenteriae serovar 2/E. coli O112ac pattern. They were positive by PCR for ipaH and ial enteroinvasive genes but negative for all other genes tested. Antiserum was prepared from one of the isolates and tested against Shigella and E. coli reference strains as well as the other isolates. The antiserum reacted with the five remaining isolates and showed cross-reactivity with S. dysenteriae serovars 1, 4, and 16; Shigella flexneri type 3; and E. coli O118, O159, O168, O172, and O173 antigens. Absorbing the sera with E. coli O159 and S. dysenteriae serovar 4 antigen removed all cross-reactions and only slightly reduced the homologous titer. Based on biochemical, molecular, and complete serological analysis, we propose that these six isolates represent a new provisional serovar of S. dysenteriae, type strain BEDP 02-5104.","['Melito PL', 'Woodward DL', 'Munro J', 'Walsh J', 'Foster R', 'Tilley P', 'Paccagnella A', 'Isaac-Renton J', 'Ismail J', 'Ng LK']",2005,43,2,J Clin Microbiol,"Melito PL, et al.

15695506,A novel caspase-1/toll-like receptor 4-independent pathway of cell death induced by cytosolic Shigella in infected macrophages.,"Shigella-induced macrophage cell death is an important step in the induction of acute inflammatory responses that ultimately lead to bacillary dysentery. Cell death was previously reported to be dependent upon the activation of caspase-1 via interaction with IpaB secreted by intracellular Shigella, but in this study, we show that Shigella infection of macrophages can also induce cell death independent of caspase-1 or IpaB activity. Time-lapse imaging and electron microscopic analyses indicated that caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death is morphologically indistinguishable and that both resemble necrosis. Analyses of Shigella mutants or Escherichia coli using co-infection with Listeria suggested that a component common to Gram-negative bacteria is involved in inducing caspase-1-independent cell death. Further studies revealed that translocation of bacterial lipid A into the cytosol of macrophages potentially mediates cell death. Notably, cell death induced by cytosolic bacteria was TLR4-independent. These results identify a novel cell death pathway induced by intracellular Gram-negative bacteria that may play a role in microbial-host interactions and inflammatory responses.","['Suzuki T', 'Nakanishi K', 'Tsutsui H', 'Iwai H', 'Akira S', 'Inohara N', 'Chamaillard M', 'Nuñez G', 'Sasakawa C']",2005,280,14,J Biol Chem,"Suzuki T, et al.

15653123,Campylobacter species and drug resistance in a north Indian rural community.,"Campylobacter species are known as agents of enteritis worldwide. However, rural community-based studies on Campylobacter infections are lacking. We carried out a prospective case-control study from July to December 2002 to investigate the prevalence and socio-epidemiological determinants of Campylobacter infection in a rural community in north India and the drug resistance of Campylobacter strains isolated from the community. Stool specimens from 348 subjects with diarrhoea and 351 age- and gender-matched asymptomatic controls were cultured for Campylobacter, Salmonella and Shigella. All Campylobacter strains were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Campylobacter species were isolated from 47 (13.5%) subjects with diarrhoea and 2 (0.6%) asymptomatic controls respectively (P<0.001). Campylobacter infection was significantly higher in children aged less than 5 years, families engaged in agriculture and persons who did not wash their hands with soap after peri-anal washing following defaecation. Campylobacter infections were more frequent than combined Salmonella and Shigella infections (47/348 vs. 15/351; P<0.001) in subjects with diarrhoea. Only two Campylobacter-infected individuals with diarrhoea had bloody stools. Antibiotic resistance of Campylobacter species was as follows: ampicillin 81.6%, ciprofloxacin 71.4%, tetracycline 26.5%, furazolidine 14.3%, gentamicin 10.2% and erythromycin 6.1%; 30.6% of strains were multidrug resistant.

15635961,Antimicrobial resistance of Shigella flexneri serotypes in Israel during a period of three years: 2000-2002.,"This is a surveillance study of the antimicrobial resistance of the S. flexneri group in the context of its serotype diversity. It includes 1422 isolates, which were sent to the National Shigella Reference Centre (NSRC) by hospitals and outpatient clinics in Israel during a 3-year period (2000-2002). The strains were identified and classified according to the prevalence and antigenic structure of their serotypes. All samples were checked for resistance to ampicillin (AMP), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ceftriaxone (CRO), tetracycline (TE), nalidixic acid (NAL), and chloramphenicol (C) by the disk diffusion method of Bauer et al. There were significant differences in their resistance to the individual antimicrobials with resistance to AMP, TE and C being lower among the strains of serotype 6 than among those of serotypes 2a and 1b. The resistant phenotypes were also serotype-specific. The similarities both in individual and in phenotype resistance between the rare and the prevalent serotypes (but not serotype 6) may be attributed to their antigenic relatedness. The serospecificity of the antimicrobial resistance was not affected by external factors such as seasonality and source (hospital or outpatient laboratory) of the isolates, and the age and sex of the patients. The serotype-specific approach can assist in properly assessing the problem of the antimicrobial resistance of the Shigella flexneri group and may prove useful for the empirical therapy of shigellosis. The observed interdependency between resistance and the antigenic specificity and relatedness of the S. flexneri serotypes requires additional investigation.","['Vasilev V', 'Japheth R', 'Yishai R', 'Andorn N']",2004,132,6,Epidemiol Infect,"Vasilev V, et al.

15618190,Virulent Shigella flexneri causes damage to mitochondria and triggers necrosis in infected human monocyte-derived macrophages.,"Shigella flexneri is a gram-negative bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery in humans that is characterized by an acute inflammatory response of the colon. The fate of phagocytes that are infected in vitro with virulent Shigella has been the subject of some investigation and debate. In this study we found that virulent Shigella caused a rapid increase in the cell membrane permeability of infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) but not in the cell membrane permeability of monocytes, as demonstrated by the uptake of fluorescent vital dyes. Within 2 h of infection, 59% +/- 6% of the HMDM and </=4% of the monocytes were stained with propidium iodide. Treatment of the cells with the inhibitors of caspases YVAD and zVAD, the antioxidants N-acetyl-l-cysteine and butylated hydroxyanisole, or an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, diphenyleniodonium, did not alter the infection outcome. Importantly, we found that virulent Shigella caused a rapid drop in the ATP level to about 50% in infected HMDM. Furthermore, using a combination of fluorescent vital dyes and mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dyes, we observed that cells that exhibited a permeable cell membrane were not stained by the mitochondrion-specific dyes, indicating that the mitochondrial membrane potential was lost in these cells. We also observed infected cells that were not stained with either type of dye, indicating that the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential preceded the increase in cell membrane permeability. Taken together, our studies showed that virulent Shigella flexneri targets the host cell mitochondria for destruction. This activity may account for the necrotic cell death precipitated by these pathogens.","['Koterski JF', 'Nahvi M', 'Venkatesan MM', 'Haimovich B']",2005,73,1,Infect Immun,"Koterski JF, et al.

15618144,Transcriptional adaptation of Shigella flexneri during infection of macrophages and epithelial cells: insights into the strategies of a cytosolic bacterial pathogen.,"Shigella flexneri, the etiologic agent of bacillary dysentery, invades epithelial cells as well as macrophages and dendritic cells and escapes into the cytosol soon after invasion. Dissection of the global gene expression profile of the bacterium in its intracellular niche is essential to fully understand the biology of Shigella infection. We have determined the complete gene expression profiles for S. flexneri infecting human epithelial HeLa cells and human macrophage-like U937 cells. Approximately one quarter of the S. flexneri genes showed significant transcriptional adaptation during infection; 929 and 1,060 genes were up- or down-regulated within HeLa cells and U937 cells, respectively. The key S. flexneri virulence genes, ipa-mxi-spa and icsA, were drastically down-regulated during intracellular growth. This theme seems to be common in bacterial infection, because the Ipa-Mxi-Spa-like type III secretion systems were also down-regulated during mammalian cell infection by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157. The bacteria experienced restricted levels of iron, magnesium, and phosphate in both host cell types, as shown by up-regulation of the sitABCD system, the mgtA gene, and genes of the phoBR regulon. Interestingly, ydeO and other acid-induced genes were up-regulated only in U937 cells and not in HeLa cells, suggesting that the cytosol of U937 cells is acidic. Comparison with the gene expression of intracellular Salmonella serovar Typhimurium, which resides within the Salmonella-containing vacuole, indicated that S. flexneri is exposed to oxidative stress in U937 cells. This work will facilitate functional studies of hundreds of novel intracellularly regulated genes that may be important for the survival and growth strategies of Shigella in the human host.","['Lucchini S', 'Liu H', 'Jin Q', 'Hinton JC', 'Yu J']",2005,73,1,Infect Immun,"Lucchini S, et al.

15617528,Intravenous infection of virulent shigellae causes fulminant hepatitis in mice.,"Shigella spp. are pathogenic bacteria responsible for bacillary dysentery in humans. The major lesions in colonic mucosa are intense inflammation with apoptosis of macrophages and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The study of shigellosis is hindered by the natural resistance of rodents to oral infection with Shigella. Therefore, animal models exploit other routes of infection. Here, we describe a novel murine model in which animals receive shigellae via the caudal vein. Mice infected with 5 x 10(6) (LD(50)) virulent shigellae died at 48 h post infection, whereas animals receiving non-invasive mutants survived. The liver is the main target of infection, where shigellae induce microgranuloma formation. In mice infected with invasive bacteria, high frequency of apoptotic cells is observed within hepatic microgranulomas along with significant levels of mRNA for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-18, IL-12 and IFN-gamma. Moreover, in the blood of these animals high levels of IL-6 and transaminases are detected. Our results demonstrate the intravenous model is suitable for pathogenicity studies and useful to explore the immune response after Shigella infection.","['Martino MC', 'Rossi G', 'Tattoli I', 'Martini I', 'Chiavolini D', 'Cortese G', 'Pozzi G', 'Bernardini ML']",2005,7,1,Cell Microbiol,"Martino MC, et al.

15614179,[Antibiotic treatment of Shigella sonnei gastroenteritis].,"UNLABELLED: THE INTEREST OF ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT OF SHIGELLA INFECTIONS: to reduce the carriage and contamination, duration of the symptoms and the risk of complications.
THE EVOLUTION OF THE TREATMENT: Over the past years, strains of Shigella sonnei have become resistant to aminopenicillin and cotrimoxazole (treatment recommended till now) and now predominate. INTER-HUMAN TRANSMISSION: The Shigella reservoir is human. The bacteria are easily transmitted in fecal-oral mode. The populations most at risk are those in situations of great promiscuity.
REGARDING DIAGNOSIS: Shigella sonnei infections are commonly characterised by intermediate diarrhoea and fever, following a short period of incubation. Only culture of the faeces permits the diagnosis.
THE DECISION TO TREAT: Confronted with an isolated case, treatment can only be initiated after bacteriological diagnosis. Confronted with symptomatic cases with at least one confirmed bacteriologically, treatment can be initiated without waiting for the results of the faecal culture.
IN CHILDREN: Azithromycine has become the treatment of choice. Ceftriaxone, administered via the parenteral route, can hardly be considered as the first-line treatment. Quinolones can only be considered in last intention; only ciprofloxacine can be recommended.
IN ADULTS: Ciprofloxacine and ofloxacine can be recommended first-line over a period of 3 days.

15610914,Role of 57 kDa major antigenic component of Shigella dysenteriae outer membrane proteins in induction of major histocompatibility complex II-restricted T-cell response.,"BACKGROUND: In the past, many Shigella surface antigens were used to activate both T and B lymphocytes but failed to induce antigen-specific responses in Shigellosis. Our objective was to identify in vitro T-cell components using 57 kDa major antigenic fraction of Shigella dysenteriae 1 (IPC-31) outer membrane proteins (OMPs) in modulating specific T-cell subset responses against Shigellosis.
METHODS: Antigen-specific T- and B-cell activation was studied in immunized Balb/c mice against 57 kDa antigen by proliferative responses using [3H]-thymidine incorporation and avidin-biotin complex (ABC) peroxidase staining for CD4, CD8, CD3, CD22, and CD25 followed by IL-2 and IL-4 estimation. Macrophage functional assays for migration inhibition factors (MIF) and superoxide (O2-) anions were also performed against 57 kDa antigen, whole OMPs, and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation.
RESULTS: Greater increase of lymphocyte proliferation was observed after 57 kDa antigen stimulation than post-OMP and -PHA stimulation. Proportionately, CD4+ and CD25+ expression of total CD3+ T-cells was significantly dominant (p >0.05) over CD8+ T-cells. On day 7 of this stimulation, it was found to increase % MIF and O2- anions with decrease of IL-2 leading to activation of MHC-II antigens. Later, on day 28 of immunization, IL-2 levels were more increased than on days 7 and 14 but insignificant with non-immunized mice stimulated with 57 kDa. Levels of IL-2 were also noted with low degree of internalization to its IL-2R receptors rather than to IL-4 receptors. In parallel, expression of CD22 was also recorded higher in this stimulation than in PHA, indicating a T-cell-dependent humoral response.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that 57 kDa major antigenic OMP is immunogenic for MHC II-restricted T-cell response to acquire host defense against Shigella infection.","['Bagchi AK', 'Sinha AK']",2004,35,5,Arch Med Res,Bagchi AK and Sinha AK.

15609785,The importance of engaging policy-makers at the outset to guide research on and introduction of vaccines: the use of policy-maker surveys.,"Face-to-face surveys of policy-makers and other influential leaders are a useful tool to identify, at an early stage, (a) major issues regarding the introduction of a new vaccine, (b) persons and groups in a country who play a major decision-making or influential role in the introduction of vaccines, (c) potential obstacles to the introduction of vaccines, and (d) data-needs of policy-makers to overcome these obstacles. By surveying the opinions and beliefs of those who will make or influence decisions on whether to introduce a new vaccine, these studies can help ensure that research activities respond to the needs of policy-makers in countries endemic for the target diseases. These surveys can also inform vaccine-introduction strategies by identifying financially and politically feasible means of distributing, targeting, and financing the vaccines. This paper describes the methodology used in conducting such surveys and discusses methodological issues. It also presents lessons learnt from two policy-maker surveys carried out in several Asian countries in regard to new-generation vaccines against cholera, typhoid fever, and shigellosis; and future vaccines against dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever.",['DeRoeck D'],2004,22,3,J Health Popul Nutr,DeRoeck D.

However, there remain multiple and integrated behavioural, sociocultural and political-economic barriers to vaccination. The Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) Programme has undertaken shigellosis disease-burden studies and oral cholera and typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccine trials in seven Asian countries. As part of these projects, sociobehavioural studies have been undertaken to determine the potential demand for vaccines for these diseases and the obstacles and enabling factors that may affect acceptance, delivery, and use of vaccines. A theoretical model of acceptance of vaccination and a triangulation of qualitative and quantitative methods have been used for fully elucidating the range of issues relating to vaccination for shigellosis, cholera, and typhoid fever. In this paper, the theoretical and methodological basis of the DOMI projects has been reviewed in a context of current sociobehavioural research on the acceptability and desirability of vaccination.","['Kaljee LM', 'Pack R', 'Pach A', 'Nyamete A', 'Stanton BF']",2004,22,3,J Health Popul Nutr,"Kaljee LM, et al.

15609775,Multidisciplinary studies of disease burden in the Diseases of the Most Impoverished Programme.,"With limited healthcare resources, rational prioritization of healthcare interventions requires knowledge and analysis of disease burden. In the absence of actual disease-burden data from less-developed countries, various types of morbidity and mortality estimates have been made. Besides having questionable reliability, these estimates do not capture the full burden of a disease since they provide only the number of cases and deaths. The modelling methods that include disability are more comprehensive but are difficult to understand, and their reliability is affected by baseline approximations. To provide policy-makers with information needed for rational decision-making, the Diseases of the Most Impoverished (DOMI) Programme of the International Vaccine Institute has used a multidisciplinary approach to describe the burden of disease due to typhoid fever, shigellosis, and cholera. Recognizing the relative advantages and disadvantages of various methodologies, the programme employs passive clinic-based surveillance in defined communities to provide prospective data. The prospective data are complemented with retrospectively-collected information from existing sources, frequently less accurate and complete but readily available for the whole population over extended periods. To create a more complete picture, economic and qualitative studies specific to each disease are incorporated in these prospective studies. The goal is to achieve a more complete and realistic picture by combining the results of these various methodologies, acknowledging the strengths and limitations of each. These projects also build in-country capacity in terms of treatment, diagnosis, epidemiology, and data management.","['Deen JL', 'von Seidlein L', 'Clemens JD']",2004,22,3,J Health Popul Nutr,"Deen JL, et al.

After OVI was given to the mice via gastric lavage, the effects of OVI on the infected mice were observed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for dysentery bacteria were determined in vitro. The results showed that origanum volatile oil showed obvious protective effect on mice infected with Sh. sonnei and Sh. flexneri F2a and it had germistatic and germicidal effects on dysentry bacteria.

26443362,Virulence Gene Regulation in Shigella.,"Shigella species are the causative agents of bacillary dysentery in humans, an invasive disease in which the bacteria enter the cells of the epithelial layer of the large intestine, causing extensive tissue damage and inflammation. They rely on a plasmid-encoded type III secretion system (TTSS) to cause disease; this system and its regulation have been investigated intensively at the molecular level for decades. The lessons learned have not only deepened our knowledge of Shigella biology but also informed in important ways our understanding of the mechanisms used by other pathogenic bacteria to cause disease and to control virulence gene expression. In addition, the Shigella story has played a central role in the development of our appreciation of the contribution of horizontal DNA transfer to pathogen evolution.A 30-kilobase-pair ""Entry Region"" of the 230-kb virulence plasmid lies at the heart of the Shigella pathogenesis system. Here are located the virB and mxiE regulatory genes and most of the structural genes involved in the expression of the TTSS and its effector proteins. Expression of the virulence genes occurs in response to an array of environmental signals, including temperature, osmolarity, and pH.At the top of the regulatory hierarchy and lying on the plasmid outside the Entry Region isvirF, encoding an AraC-like transcription factor.Virulence gene expression is also controlled by chromosomal genes,such as those encoding the nucleoid-associated proteins H-NS, IHF, and Fis, the two-component regulators OmpR/EnvZ and CpxR/CpxA, the anaerobic regulator Fnr, the iron-responsive regulator Fur, and the topoisomerases of the cell that modulate DNA supercoiling. Small regulatory RNAs,the RNA chaperone Hfq,and translational modulation also affect the expression of the virulence phenotypetranscriptionally and/orposttranscriptionally.",['Dorman CJ'],2004,1,1,EcoSal Plus,Dorman CJ.

26443352,"Vaccines against Infections Caused by Salmonella, Shigella, and Pathogenic Escherichia coli.","Infectious diseases represent one of the most common causes of death worldwide, with the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella and pathogenic Escherichia coli being among the most detrimental. Currently, vaccination represents the preferred method of preventing such infections. For stimulating the adaptive immune response, immunizations are frequently based on formulations which include inactivated whole-cell vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, or subunit vaccines. These can be administered via a parenteral or mucosal route, the latter having the advantage that it most closely mimics the actual course of infection. In addition to the type of vaccine and method of application, important consideration needs to be paid to safety, efficacy, and cost, which are often major bottlenecks in the successful implementation of vaccines. In this chapter we take a limited look at the history surrounding vaccinations involving Salmonella, Shigella, and pathogenic E. coli. Salmonella infections, which can lead to typhoid fever, are becoming increasing difficult to treat with antibiotics due to multi-drug-resistant strains. At present, the parenteral Vi-based subunit vaccines and the live attenuated oral vaccine Ty21a have proven to be the vaccines of choice, with high levels of protective efficacy and limited side effects. Shigella infections are responsible for the diarrheal disease shigellosis. Various live and nonliving mucosal and parenteral vaccines have been tested, with the most promising candidates evolving around those that stimulate the production of O-antigen-specific antibodies. Pathogenic Escherichia coli infections can lead to severe diseases due to the bacterium's production of several specific toxins. Vaccines against this bacterium target its toxins, as well as surface-exposed antigens, all of which have been found to be effective as immunogens.","['Guzman CA', 'Borsutzky S', 'Favre D', 'Dietrich G']",2004,1,1,EcoSal Plus,"Guzman CA, et al.

METHODS: A questionnaire on enteric and extraintestinal, especially musculoskeletal, symptoms was sent to 278 consecutive patients with Shigella positive stool culture and to 597 controls. Analysis of self reported musculoskeletal symptoms was supplemented with clinical examination of those subjects with recent symptoms.
RESULTS: Of the patients, 14/211 (7%) had ReA, and a further 4/211 (2%) other reactive musculoskeletal symptoms (tendonitis, enthesopathy, or bursitis). Of the 14 patients with ReA, all adults, 10 had S sonnei, three S flexneri, and one S dysenteriae infection. HLA-B27 was positive in 36% of the patients with ReA. One control subject had ReA. In the patients with Shigella infection, the odds ratio for developing ReA was 16.2 (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 123.9), p = 0.001.

From 1991 to 2002, 5,911 clinical strains were isolated and screened for resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Twenty of the Shigella isolates were ESBL positive, based on the synergistic effects between clavulanate and selected beta-lactams (ceftazidime and cefotaxime).

15523809,[Vaccines for all occasions].,"The strategy of immunizing a population at risk of infectious disease has been enormously successful medically and has also proven to be cost effective. Development of effective immunogens, that induce active immunization, is a long process that requires careful monitoring and assurance of short and long term safety, induction of protective immunity and proven efficacy in preventing the disease. A successful immunization program is also dependent on delivery of the vaccine to as many susceptible individuals as possible, so as to attain herd immunity. Passive immunization with antibodies, usually used prior to the development of active vaccines has also been remarkably effective. The special circumstances of the field and crowded conditions have demanded that the Medical Corps of the Israeli army cater for the needs of our soldiers. In this issue, the past achievements and current immunization policy are outlined for the first time. Their contribution to the health of our soldiers is commendable. Close monitoring of the epidemiology of infectious disease in the special circumstances of field conditions has prompted successful programs to markedly reduce infectious hepatitis A by passive immunization with gamma globulin in the past and, nowadays, with the killed active viral vaccine. In addition, prevention of influenza by killed viral vaccine and invasive bacterial disease by Neisseria meningitidis with multivalent polysaccharide vaccines are being used.

To observe the effect of anti-CD3, other T-cell cultures were also established following anti-CD1, anti-IL2 and phytohaemagglutinin stimulation. Anti-CD3 stimulation of reconstituted T-cells showed 'mean' levels of CD4 and CD25 were enhanced by 34.5 and 31.1 % in immunized mice, which was comparable to 53.2 and 50.7 %, respectively, in challenged-immunized mice, and were dominant over CD8+ T-cells. Levels of IL2 generated by anti-CD3-stimulated T-cells of immunized mice were greater than those of unstimulated T-cells and were significantly elevated in challenged-immunized mice. The reactivity of T-cells indicated their complete responsiveness, as anti-CD3 antibody might not inhibit the migration of the macrophages but rather inhibit IL4. These macrophage factors synergistically act with anions towards an activated response, which in turn provokes IL2 secretion with a low degree of internalization of its receptor. Thus, sharing of IL2 to form a high-affinity receptor complex with CD4+ T-cells through motive signals suggested a generalized T-cell activation with increased humoral responses. Macrophage migration inhibition factor (MIF) and IL4 responses during anti-CD3 stimulation of immunized mice indicated that the role of anti-CD3 in generation of O2- is due to a synergistic effect by Th1 subsets of Th0 cells. The above findings should have implications for understanding the immunoregulatory role of anti-CD3 associated with 57 kDa antigen in immunoprophylactic measures.","['Sinha AK', 'Bagchi AK']",2004,53,Pt 11,J Med Microbiol,Sinha AK and Bagchi AK.

Defeating these defence mechanisms and breaching the cell membrane barrier is the ultimate challenge for most pathogens. By invading the host and, moreover, by penetrating into individual host cells, pathogens gain access to a protective niche, not only to avoid immune clearance, but also to replicate and to disseminate from cell to cell within the infected host. Many pathogens are accomplishing these challenges by exploiting the actin cytoskeleton in a highly sophisticated manner as a result of having evolved common as well as unique strategies.","['Rottner K', 'Lommel S', 'Wehland J', 'Stradal TE']",2004,204,4,J Pathol,"Rottner K, et al.

15494948,Shigella infections in children: new insights.,"Shigellosis , the acute enteric infection caused by bacteria of the genus Shigella , has a worldwide distribution with an estimated annual incidence of 164.7 million cases, of which 163.2 million occur in developing countries, and 1.1 million deaths. Sixty-nine percent of all episodes and 61 percent of all Shigella -related deaths involve children younger than 5 years old. In the United States, 10,000 to 15,000 cases of shigellosis are reported each year. Although usually confined to the colonic mucosa, shigellosis sometimes can cause extraintestinal complications. Recent publications have shed light on the clinical characteristics of Shigella -induced bacteremia, surgical complications, urogenital symptoms, and neurologic manifestations, and on the unique manifestations in the neonatal period. The mainstay of treatment of shigellosis in children is correction of the fluid and electrolyte loss, which often is achieved by the administration of oral rehydration solutions. Appropriate antibiotic therapy shortens the duration of both clinical symptoms and fecal excretion of the pathogen. However, the increasing antimicrobial resistance of shigellae worldwide constitutes a major problem.

Increased cost of disease management, and higher mortality in children. This study exposes 51 â-lactamase producing Shigella isolates from Lagos to some newly introduced drugs in the country. The drugs include â-lactam - â-actamase inhibitor antibiotics. â-lctam substrate hydrolysis and inhibitory effects of clavulanate were also investigated in-vitro. Results obtained revealed that all the isolates showed high level resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin, co-trimoxazole and amoxicillin with an MIC range of 128 - 1024 microg/ml. The isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, tobramycin, aztreonam and ofloxacin (0.03 - 8 microg/ ml). 18.2 - 40.9% of S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae showed low level resistance to cefuroxime and cefotaxime (MIC = 4 - 16 microg/ ml). Among the â-lactam - â- lctamase inhibitors tested, only piperacillin-tazobactam showed 100% resistance. Hydrolysis of â -lctam substrate was found to be species dependent in decreasing order of S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. sonnei and S.boydii. An IC50 range of 0.8-2.4 mM was also observed in these isolates. Our data indicate that the incidence of multidrug resistance is high among â-lactamase producing Shigella isolates in Lagos, Nigeria. While the third generation cephalosporins should be used with cautions, some of the newly introduced drugs have the prospects of being used in the future control and management of shigellosis in the country.","['Iwalokur BA', 'Gbenle GO', 'Akinrinmisi EO', 'Smith SI', 'Ogunledun A']",2004,33,1,Afr J Med Med Sci,"Iwalokur BA, et al.

15473520,"The health belief model and factors relating to potential use of a vaccine for shigellosis in Kaeng Koi district, Saraburi province, Thailand.","Shigellosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Approximately, 1.1 million deaths occur a year due to this disease, making it the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide. This paper explores local interest in and potential use of a vaccine for shigellosis in Thailand where Shigella poses an important public-health concern. Data for this study were collected during June-November 2002 from 522 subjects surveyed using a sociobehavioural questionnaire in Kaeng Koi district in central Thailand. The community demand and likely use of a vaccine were examined in relation to the Health Belief Model, which provides analytical constructs for investigating the multiple issues of local readiness to accept and access a new vaccine. As the key outcome variable, most respondents showed interest in receiving a vaccine against dysentery which they thought would provide useful protection against the disease. However, there was only a moderate number who perceived dysentery as serious and themselves as susceptible to it, although it was perceived to cause some burden to and additional expense for families. Most people identified a number of groups who were thought to be especially vulnerable to dysentery, such as the elderly, pre-school, and school-age children, and poor labourers. Other outcomes of the study included the identification of acceptable and convenient sites for its delivery, such as government health clinics and private clinics, and respected sources for information about the vaccine, such as health clinic personnel and community health volunteers. This information suggests that components of the Health Belief Model may be useful in identifying community acceptance of a vaccine and the means of introducing it. This health information is important for planning and implementing vaccine programmes.","['Butraporn P', 'Pach A', 'Pack RP', 'Masngarmmeung R', 'Maton T', 'Sri-aroon P', 'Nyamete A', 'Chaicumpa W']",2004,22,2,J Health Popul Nutr,"Butraporn P, et al.

15473519,Cultural and social context of dysentery: implications for the introduction of a new vaccine.,"Dysentery, a severe form of diarrhoeal disease, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Paradoxically, virtually no studies have been conducted to examine beliefs and behaviours associated with dysentery. The explanatory model of dysentery was explored in a community in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to understand the acceptability of a vaccine against dysentery. A local term for bloody dysentery is widely known, and residents describe a progression of symptoms, which closely mirrors the biomedical model of the disease. Due to the symbolic significance of blood loss and the fact that there is much uncertainty regarding treatment, bloody dysentery is perceived to be extremely serious. Causal interpretations most commonly relate to humoral theories, and remedies involve the consumption of 'cooling' foods that will reduce the heat associated with dysentery. Despite many misconceptions about vaccines and the fact that this approach contradicts aetiological explanations, the perceived severity of the illness makes vaccines attractive compared to other preventative measures. The results illuminate relevant information for the implementation of a new vaccine.","['Blum LS', 'Nahar N']",2004,22,2,J Health Popul Nutr,Blum LS and Nahar N.

15447770,Association of Helicobacter pylori infection with Shigella gastroenteritis in young children.,"OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori infection is acquired mainly in early childhood. Much is unknown about the mode of transmission. The organism can be cultivated from cathartic stools and vomitus and is potentially transmissible during episodes of gastrointestinal tract illness. Because Shigella and Salmonella are common pathogens in enteric infections in children, we examined the association of H. pylori with Shigella and Salmonella infections in pediatric patients.
METHODS: The study population included consecutive children aged 2-72 months hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis who had culture-proven shigellosis (N = 78) or salmonellosis (N = 76). Sixty-five healthy similarly aged children with culture-negative stools served as controls. Parents of cases were queried for personal and family characteristics and socioeconomic indicators. The stool specimens from all participants were tested for H. pylori antigen.
RESULTS: On univariate analysis, Shigella gastroenteritis was significantly associated with H. pylori positivity (odds ratio, OR: 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-8.8, p= 0.004) compared to controls. This association remained significant even after adjusting for living conditions, father's occupation, and father's education (OR = 3.38, 95% CI: 1.39-8.22, p= 0.007). Salmonella gastroenteritis was not associated with H. pylori positivity (OR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.4-3.0, p= 0.8).
CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection in young children is associated with Shigella gastroenteritis. This association warrants further investigation.","['Shmuely H', 'Samra Z', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Dinari G', 'Chodick G', 'Yahav J']",2004,99,10,Am J Gastroenterol,"Shmuely H, et al.

Children were visited twice a week and a stool sample was collected from any of them with diarrhea. The incidence of Shigella-associated diarrhea was 0.2 episodes/child-year, with S. flexneri being the most common serogroup isolated (55% of Shigella episodes). Younger age and the warm months increased the risk of developing Shigella-associated diarrhea, while breastfeeding was protective. Children with Shigella were ill for a mean of four days and passed a mean of six stools per day. Common symptoms included fever (35%), vomiting (19%), and dehydration (16%). Dysentery, however, was unusual, occurring in only 11% of the cases. In conclusion, Shigella-associated diarrhea remains relatively common in Egyptian children and supports the need for additional control measures including vaccine development.","['Abu-Elyazeed RR', 'Wierzba TF', 'Frenck RW', 'Putnam SD', 'Rao MR', 'Savarino SJ', 'Kamal KA', 'Peruski LF', 'Abd-El Messih IA', 'El-Alkamy SA', 'Naficy AB', 'Clemens JD']",2004,71,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Abu-Elyazeed RR, et al.

15356171,IL-8 is a key chemokine regulating neutrophil recruitment in a new mouse model of Shigella-induced colitis.,"The lack of a mouse model of acute rectocolitis mimicking human bacillary dysentery in the presence of invasive Shigella is a major handicap to study the pathogenesis of the disease and to develop a Shigella vaccine. The inability of the mouse intestinal mucosa to elicit an inflammatory infiltrate composed primarily of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) may be due to a defect in epithelial invasion, in the sensing of invading bacteria, or in the effector mechanisms that recruit the PMN infiltrate. We demonstrate that the BALB/cJ mouse colonic epithelium not only can be invaded by Shigella, but also elicits an inflammatory infiltrate that, however, lacks PMN. This observation points to a major defect of mice in effector mechanisms, particularly the lack of expression of the CXC chemokine, IL-8. Indeed, this work demonstrates that the delivery of recombinant human IL-8, together with Shigella infection of the colonic epithelial surface, causes an acute colitis characterized by a strong PMN infiltrate that, by all criteria, including transcription profiles of key mediators of the innate/inflammatory response and histopathological lesions, mimics bacillary dysentery. This is a major step forward in the development of a murine model of bacillary dysentery.","['Singer M', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2004,173,6,J Immunol,Singer M and Sansonetti PJ.

15322001,Molecular evolutionary relationships of enteroinvasive Escherichia coli and Shigella spp.,"Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC), a distinctive pathogenic form of E. coli causing dysentery, is similar in many properties to bacteria placed in the four species of Shigella. Shigella has been separated as a genus but in fact comprises several clones of E. coli. The evolutionary relationships of 32 EIEC strains of 12 serotypes have been determined by sequencing of four housekeeping genes and two plasmid genes which were used previously to determine the relationships of Shigella strains. The EIEC strains were grouped in four clusters with one outlier strain, indicating independent derivation of EIEC several times. Three of the four clusters contain more than one O antigen type. One EIEC strain (an O112ac:H- strain) was found in Shigella cluster 3 but is not identical to the Shigella cluster 3 D2 and B15 strains with the same O antigen. Two forms of the virulence plasmid pINV have been identified in Shigella strains by using the sequences of ipgD and mxiA genes, and all but two of our EIEC strains have pINV A. The EIEC strains were grouped in two subclusters with a very low level of variation, generally not intermingled with Shigella pINV A strains. The EIEC clusters based on housekeeping genes were reflected in the plasmid gene sequences, with some exceptions. Two strains were found in the pINV B form by using the ipgD sequence, with one strain having an mxiA sequence similar to the divergent sequence of D1.

15313002,Expression of His-tagged Shigella IpaC in Arabidopsis.,"Although the expression of histidine (His)-tagged proteins in bacteria is routine, few His-tagged proteins have been expressed in plants, and no His-tagged proteins from bacterial pathogens have been expressed in plants, to our knowledge. Here, we demonstrate expression of the Shigella flexneri invasion plasmid antigen, IpaC, in Arabidopsis thaliana. S. flexneri is the causitive trigger for bacillary dysentery, and IpaC is essential for bacterial entry into epithelial cells. IpaC, attached to a 5' leader containing six tandem His codons, was cloned into a pBI121 vector. This clone was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Arabidopsis plants were then transformed. T1 and T2 plant generations were obtained. Total plant proteins were extracted from T2 leaves; the Bradford assay was used to determine protein concentrations. A nickel-coated ELISA plate method, using both anti-His and anti-IpaC 1 degrees antibodies, was used to detect and quantify IpaC in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Between 1.9 and 2.3 microg IpaC/mg total plant protein was obtained; this equals 0.2% of total protein, an amount comparable to other recombinant protein estimates in plants. Expressing His-tagged proteins from bacterial pathogens, in plants, is important because plant material could ultimately be fed or applied intranasally to animals that are ""at risk"" for infection by such bacterial pathogens, thus causing them to raise antibodies against the pathogens--functioning as a vaccine.","['MacRae AF', 'Preiszner J', 'Ng S', 'Bolla RI']",2004,112,3,J Biotechnol,"MacRae AF, et al.

A retrospective investigation on sexual risk factors for infection in all shigella cases from Berlin from 2001 was initiated by sending a questionnaire to all patients without known travel history. Simultaneously laboratories were asked to send new shigella isolates from patients to the National Reference Centre at the RKI. Out of 29 responders, 24 self-identified as MSM. Seventeen of these reported sexual contacts as the most likely potential risk of infection. Almost all MSM reported direct or indirect oral-anal sexual contacts in the week before they fell ill. Fifteen of 27 shigella isolates collected during the prospective sampling period showed identical plasmid profiles, PFGE- and resistance patterns and can therefore be regarded as clonally identical. Asymptomatic and/or prolonged shedding in the reconvalescent phase may contribute to the transmission risk of shigella infection during oral-anal sexual practices. Awareness among practitioners and among MSM about the risk of sexual transmission of orally transmitted agents needs to be raised.","['Marcus U', 'Zucs P', 'Bremer V', 'Hamouda O', 'Prager R', 'Tschaepe H', 'Futh U', 'Kramer M']",2004,15,8,Int J STD AIDS,"Marcus U, et al.

15293449,The omptin family of enterobacterial surface proteases/adhesins: from housekeeping in Escherichia coli to systemic spread of Yersinia pestis.,"The omptins are a family of enterobacterial surface proteases/adhesins that share high sequence identity and a conserved beta-barrel fold in the outer membrane. The omptins are multifunctional, and the individual omptins exhibit differing virulence-associated functions. The Pla plasminogen activator of Yersinia pestis contributes by several mechanisms to bacterial invasiveness and the systemic, uncontrolled proteolysis in plague. Pla proteolytically activates the human proenzyme plasminogen and inactivates the antiprotease alpha2-antiplasmin, and its binding to laminin localizes the uncontrolled plasmin activity onto basement membranes. These properties enhance bacterial migration through tissue barriers. Pla also degrades circulating complement proteins and functions in bacterial invasion into human epithelial cells. PgtE of Salmonella enterica and OmpT of Escherichia coli have been shown to degrade cationic antimicrobial peptides from epithelial cells or macrophages. PgtE and SopA of Shigella flexneri appear important in the intracellular phases of salmonellosis and shigellosis, whereas functions of OmpT have mainly been associated with protein degradation in E. coli cells. The differing virulence roles and functions have been attributed to minor sequence variations at the surface-exposed regions important for substrate recognition, to the dependence of omptin functions on lipopolysaccharide, and to the different regulation of omptin expression.","['Kukkonen M', 'Korhonen TK']",2004,294,1,Int J Med Microbiol,Kukkonen M and Korhonen TK.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a stress neurohormone, has been implicated in the susceptibility of young children to seizures. We investigated the role of CRH in Shigella-related seizures. Pretreatment with Shigella dysenteriae sonicate enhanced mice response to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. Preinjection of antalarmin, a CRH-receptor 1 antagonist, decreased both the mean convulsion score (MCS: 1.6 vs. 1.1, p<0.05) and the percent of mice having seizures (48% vs. 28%, p=0.03). This indicates that CRH plays a role in the increased susceptibility to seizures following exposure to S. dysenteriae.","['Yuhas Y', 'Weizman A', 'Chrousos GP', 'Ovadia H', 'Ashkenazi S']",2004,153,1-2,J Neuroimmunol,"Yuhas Y, et al.

15263018,Cortactin and Crk cooperate to trigger actin polymerization during Shigella invasion of epithelial cells.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, invades epithelial cells in a process involving Src tyrosine kinase signaling. Cortactin, a ubiquitous actin-binding protein present in structures of dynamic actin assembly, is the major protein tyrosine phosphorylated during Shigella invasion. Here, we report that RNA interference silencing of cortactin expression, as does Src inhibition in cells expressing kinase-inactive Src, interferes with actin polymerization required for the formation of cellular extensions engulfing the bacteria. Shigella invasion induced the recruitment of cortactin at plasma membranes in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. Overexpression of wild-type forms of cortactin or the adaptor protein Crk favored Shigella uptake, and Arp2/3 binding-deficient cortactin derivatives or an Src homology 2 domain Crk mutant interfered with bacterial-induced actin foci formation. Crk was shown to directly interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin and to condition cortactin-dependent actin polymerization required for Shigella uptake. These results point at a major role for a Crk-cortactin complex in actin polymerization downstream of tyrosine kinase signaling.","['Bougnères L', 'Girardin SE', 'Weed SA', 'Karginov AV', 'Olivo-Marin JC', 'Parsons JT', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Van Nhieu GT']",2004,166,2,J Cell Biol,"Bougnères L, et al.

High priority has been given by the World Health Organization to the development of vaccines to control Shigellosis caused by these bacteria. However, information regarding to profile of immunogenic proteins of Shigella is not available now. In the present study, sub-immunoproteomics was applied to screen novel immunogenic proteins which could be reacted with antisera produced by challenge of a whole bacterium. Our results indicated that 13 immunogens were identified, in which seven proteins and six proteins from outer membrane and soluble proteome, respectively. Of the 13 proteins, 12 showed to be novel immunogens. These results suggest that immunoproteomics can greatly improve the chances of identification and result in discovery of novel immunogenic proteins.","['Peng X', 'Ye X', 'Wang S']",2004,22,21-22,Vaccine,"Peng X, et al.

Two tests of the external control of laboratory diagnosis were performed: one concerning the quality of the selective media used in the Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations (SSE) in Poland for routine bacteriological diagnosis of humans intestinal infections. It was shown that the specimens of the SS medium were acceptable only for diagnosis of S. enteritidis infections. In nearly 1/3 of SSE bacteriological laboratories was inefficient for diagnosis of S. flexneri infections and in some laboratories even not for diagnosis of infections due to S. typhi and S. sonnei. In another test the control strain of S. boydii 6 was send to SSE laboratories. The strain was properly diagnosed by all but two laboratories. Besides it was shown that the control strain was not able to grow on selective bacteriological media used for routine work. So there is a need to change the procedure used in those laboratories.

15193176,[Antibiotic resistance and molecular epidemiology of Shigella spp. in northeastern Argentina].,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the antibiotic resistance of strains of Shigella spp. isolated from feces samples from northeastern Argentina and to characterize the strains in terms of their molecular epidemiology.
METHODS: We studied 132 isolates of Shigella spp. obtained from feces samples from 132 patients with diarrhea who were seen at various private and public laboratories in the Argentine provinces of Chaco and Corrientes during the period of 1998 to 2002. Each strain was characterized according to its serotype, its resistance to 13 individual or combination antibiotics, and its sensitivity to pyocins. With 52 strains selected in relation to their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles we conducted plasmid profile analysis using alkaline lysis, and the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences were determined by amplifying repetitive DNA segments using polymerase chain reaction. The chi-square test was used to compare proportions, with a level of statistical significance of 0.05.
RESULTS: Shigella flexneri was the most common species (78%), followed by S. sonnei (22%). In general, the resistance of S. flexneri to the antibiotics studied was greater than that of S. sonnei, and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001) for ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and the combination of ampicillin and sulbactam. The S. flexneri strains also showed multiple resistance more often than S. sonnei strains (84.5% vs. 31.0%; P < 0.001). The strains isolated from S. flexneri were grouped into five pyocin types, three plasmid profiles, and five patterns of repetitive palindromic sequences. The strains of S. sonnei formed three pyocin types, two plasmid profiles, and three patterns of repetitive palindromic sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: Given that the Shigella species that were studied showed a high level of resistance to the most frequently used antibiotics, surveillance activities should be implemented in order to detect and control the appearance of new resistant strains. Applying epidemiological typing techniques can provide more precise information about the distribution and evolution of resistant strains of circulating microorganisms.","['Merino LA', 'Hreñuk GE', 'Ronconi MC', 'Alonso JM']",2004,15,4,Rev Panam Salud Publica,"Merino LA, et al.

15175305,Extensive genomic diversity in pathogenic Escherichia coli and Shigella Strains revealed by comparative genomic hybridization microarray.,"Escherichia coli, including the closely related genus Shigella, is a highly diverse species in terms of genome structure. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray analysis was used to compare the gene content of E. coli K-12 with the gene contents of pathogenic strains. Missing genes in a pathogen were detected on a microarray slide spotted with 4,071 open reading frames (ORFs) of W3110, a commonly used wild-type K-12 strain. For 22 strains subjected to the CGH microarray analyses 1,424 ORFs were found to be absent in at least one strain. The common backbone of the E. coli genome was estimated to contain about 2,800 ORFs. The mosaic distribution of absent regions indicated that the genomes of pathogenic strains were highly diversified because of insertions and deletions. Prophages, cell envelope genes, transporter genes, and regulator genes in the K-12 genome often were not present in pathogens. The gene contents of the strains tested were recognized as a matrix for a neighbor-joining analysis. The phylogenic tree obtained was consistent with the results of previous studies. However, unique relationships between enteroinvasive strains and Shigella, uropathogenic, and some enteropathogenic strains were suggested by the results of this study. The data demonstrated that the CGH microarray technique is useful not only for genomic comparisons but also for phylogenic analysis of E. coli at the strain level.","['Fukiya S', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Tobe T', 'Mori H']",2004,186,12,J Bacteriol,"Fukiya S, et al.

METHODS: National surveillance system data were compared to hospital discharge data.
RESULTS: No statistically significant correlation between the number of cases of campylobacteriosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was found. There was no statistically significant correlation between the number of cases of campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, shigellosis, and any of the categories of reactive arthritis; apart from two correlations with campylobacteriosis: with arthropathy associated with Reiter's disease and nonspecific urethritis (Pearson correlation R2=0.69; p<0.02) and unspecified infective arthritis (Pearson correlation R2=0.75; p<0.008). The later category is likely to include cases of both infective and non-infective aetiology.
CONCLUSION: In New Zealand, infectious intestinal diseases are not making a significant contribution to the burden of hospitalisation for reactive arthritis or GBS.","['Lake R', 'Baker M', 'Nichol C', 'Garrett N']",2004,117,1194,N Z Med J,"Lake R, et al.

15135963,"Quantitative contamination and transfer of Escherichia coli from foods by houseflies, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae).","The housefly, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), is recognized as an important factor in the dissemination of various infectious diseases such as cholera, shigellosis, and salmonellosis. They can also serve as a cross-contamination vector for other foodborne pathogens. However, the potential for bacterial transfer by houseflies has been demonstrated in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. In this study, the numbers of bacteria a housefly can carry on its body and transfer to a clean surface after exposure to a sugar-milk aqueous solution, steak, and potato salad contaminated with a fluorescent gene Escherichia coli (8 log10 CFU/ml) were determined. In the first series of experiments to quantify bacterial numbers on the flies, about 40-60 flies were transferred into a sterile cage, exposed to the food for 30 min, the flies immobilized and the attached E. coli on each fly enumerated. Detectable E. coli (>1.7 log10 CFU/fly) were found on 43% (29/67), 53% (23/43), and 62% (32/52) of the flies in the cages with sugar/milk, steak, and potato salad, respectively. For the positive flies, the geometric mean carriage (log10 CFU/fly) was 2.93+/-1.24 for sugar-milk, 3.77+/-1.28 for steak, and 2.25+/-0.64 for the potato salad. In the second series of experiments, the transfer of bacteria by individual flies from contaminated food to the inner surface of a sterile jar per each landing was determined. E. coli transferred from the sugar-milk was 3.5+/-0.7 log10 CFU/fly-landing, 3.9+/-0.7 for steak and 2.61+/-1.16 for the potato salad. From the initial contamination levels of bacteria and the number of transferred bacteria, it can be calculated that flies contaminate clean surfaces with approximately 0.1 mg of food per landing.","['De Jesús AJ', 'Olsen AR', 'Bryce JR', 'Whiting RC']",2004,93,2,Int J Food Microbiol,"De Jesús AJ, et al.

To get a more complete understanding of the disease burden caused by Shigella in Nha Trang, Vietnam, real-time PCR was used to detect Shigella DNA. Randomly selected rectal swab specimens from 60 Shigella culture-positive patients and 500 Shigella culture-negative patients detected by population-based surveillance of patients seeking care for diarrhea were processed by real-time PCR. The target of the primer pair is the invasion plasmid antigen H gene sequence (ipaH), carried by all four Shigella species and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. Shigella spp. could be isolated from the rectal swabs of 547 of 19,206 (3%) patients with diarrhea. IpaH was detected in 55 of 60 (93%) Shigella culture-positive specimens, whereas it was detected in 87 of 245 (36%) culture-negative patients free of dysentery (P < 0.001). The number of PCR cycles required to detect a PCR product was highest for culture-negative, nonbloody diarrheal specimens (mean number of cycles to detection, 36.6) and was lowest for children with culture-positive, bloody diarrheal specimens (mean number of cycles, 25.3) (P < 0.001). The data from real-time PCR amplification indicate that the culture-proven prevalence of Shigella among patients with diarrhea may underestimate the prevalence of Shigella infections. The clinical presentation of shigellosis may be directly related to the bacterial load.","['Vu DT', 'Sethabutr O', 'Von Seidlein L', 'Tran VT', 'Do GC', 'Bui TC', 'Le HT', 'Lee H', 'Houng HS', 'Hale TL', 'Clemens JD', 'Mason C', 'Dang DT']",2004,42,5,J Clin Microbiol,"Vu DT, et al.

These pathogens colonize the intestinal colon, invade, spreading to the other enterocytes. Breastfeeding plays a very important role in protecting infants from intestinal infections. Amongst milk compounds, glycosylated proteins prevent the adhesion of many enteropathogens in vitro. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of human milk proteins on the colonization potential of Shigella dysenteriae, S. flexneri and S. sonnei. To fulfill this purpose, pooled milk samples from five donors, were fractionated by gel filtration and affinity chromatography. Using tissue culture, the milk fractions obtained were tested in Shigella adhesion and invasion assays.
RESULTS: Our revealed showed that both adhesion and invasion of Shigella species were inhibited by low concentration of secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin and free secretory component. This work also showed that, these proteins bind to superficial and whole-cell Shigella proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that human milk may act inhibiting adhesion and, consequently, invasion of Shigella, thereafter preventing shigellosis in infants.","['Willer Eda M', 'Lima Rde L', 'Giugliano LG']",2004,4,,BMC Microbiol,"Willer Eda M, et al.

To determine whether these observations could be extended to Shigella, a dam mutant of Shigella flexneri 2a was characterized and examined for the role of dam in pathogenesis. The Shigella dam mutant showed some unique characteristics; however, it retained virulence in vivo as well as in vitro. The mutant invaded cultured L2 monolayer cells as efficiently as the wild-type parent, but its intracellular growth was suppressed up to 7 h post-invasion. Furthermore, the invading dam mutant formed smaller plaques in cell monolayers compared to the parent strain. However, the mutant produced keratoconjunctivitis in the Sereny test in guinea pigs only slightly more slowly than the wild-type. While the effect of the dam mutation on virulence was modest, the rate of spontaneous mutation in the dam mutant was 1000-fold greater compared with the wild-type. The virulence and high mutability displayed by the dam mutant of Sh. flexneri suggest that a general anti-bacterial pathogen vaccine strategy based on mutations in dam needs to be re-evaluated.","['Honma Y', 'Fernández RE', 'Maurelli AT']",2004,150,Pt 4,Microbiology (Reading),"Honma Y, et al.

Further subdivision, based on a comparison of the serotype, plasmid profile, antibiotic resistances and ipaH hybridization patterns indicated that Group I, with 11 icp (44%), had strains that were identical. Group II with 8 icp (32%), had strains that were different and Group III with 6 icp (24%), had strains with the same serotype and identical ipaH profiles but with differences in other markers. This data indicates that a diversity of shigella clones circulated in this community resulting from both clonal spread and horizontal transfer of genetic elements.

It is also a relevant model of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Among cases of acute colitis of infectious origin, shigellosis is certainly the one that has benefited the most from a significant research effort. Shigella, the causative agent, is a Gram-negative bacterium that has the capacity to invade, disrupt, and cause inflammatory destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier. The molecular and cellular bases of this invasive phenotype essentially encompass crossing of the epithelial lining, apoptotic killing of macrophages, entry into epithelial cells, and escape into the cytoplasm, followed by cell-to-cell spread. Intracellular colonization is likely to protect the micro-organisms from killing by humoral and cellular effectors of the innate immune response. Concurrently, the capacity of Shigella to reprogram invaded epithelial cells to produce proinflammatory mediators plays a major role in the strong inflammatory profile of the disease. This profile is likely to impact on the nature and quality of the adaptive response, which is dominated by humoral protection at the mucosal level.","['Phalipon A', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2003,23,5-6,Crit Rev Immunol,"Phalipon A and Sansonetti PJ.

15026012,Neuromodulation of experimental Shigella infection reduces damage to the gut mucosa.,"Bacillary dysentery arises when Shigella invades the colonic and rectal mucosae of the human gut and elicits a strong inflammatory response, which may lead to life-threatening complications. Hence, downregulation of the host inflammatory response is an appealing therapeutical alternative. The gastrointestinal tract is densely innervated, and nerve endings are often found in the vicinity of leukocytes. We have assessed the impact of experimental Shigella infection on levels of neuropeptides in the intestinal mucosa of rabbits. Ligated small intestinal loops were created in rabbits, and either live, pathogenic Shigella flexneri, a nonpathogenic mutant of Shigella, or NaCl was injected into the loops. Infection was allowed to proceed for 8 or 16 h, after which the rabbits were sacrificed and intestinal biopsies collected. Tissue destruction, fluid secretion and degree of bacterial invasion were monitored. Intestinal biopsies were homogenized, and levels of the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, peptide YY (PYY), vasoactive intestinal peptide, somatostatin, galanin, motilin and neurotensin were measured by radioimmunoassay. Loops exposed to invasive Shigella had 5.7 times lower levels of PYY (P = 0.0095) than loops exposed to NaCl, after 16 h of infection. The levels of the other neuropeptides tested were unchanged. Inhibition of nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission partly protected the intestinal mucosa from destruction elicited by invasive Shigella. These findings indicate that a tissue-invasive bacterium such as Shigella, which is strictly localized to the intestinal mucosa, activates intramural nerve reflexes that presumably involve a nicotinic synapse as well as the neuropeptide PYY.","['Svensson L', 'Bergquist J', 'Wennerås C']",2004,6,3,Microbes Infect,"Svensson L, et al.

Prolonged zinc supplementation also improves cell-mediated immunity in severely malnourished children.
OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of short-term zinc supplementation on intrinsic and specific immune and inflammatory responses in moderately malnourished children with acute shigellosis.
DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Shigella-infected children aged 12-59 mo. Elemental zinc (20 mg) and a multivitamin containing vitamins A and D, thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinamide, and calcium at twice the recommended dietary allowance were given daily for 2 wk to the zinc group (n = 28), whereas the multivitamin alone was given to the control group (n = 28). Standard antibiotic therapy was given to all patients.
RESULTS: Serum zinc concentrations increased in both groups during convalescence; however, zinc supplementation showed a significant effect. The lymphocyte proliferation response in the zinc group increased relative to that in the control group (P = 0.002), but no significant effects were seen on concentrations of cytokines (interleukin 2 and interferon gamma) released from mitogen-stimulated mononuclear cells or on concentrations of cytokines (interleukin 2, interferon gamma, and interleukin 1beta) in feces. Among the antigen [lipopolysaccharide and invasion plasmid-encoded antigen (Ipa)]-specific antibodies, plasma Ipa-specific immunoglobulin G responses at day 30 were significantly higher in the zinc group than in the control group. However, the 2 groups did not differ significantly in the other antigen-specific responses in plasma and stool.
CONCLUSION: A 14-d course of zinc supplementation during acute shigellosis increases the lymphocyte proliferation response and the Ipa-specific immunoglobulin G response.","['Raqib R', 'Roy SK', 'Rahman MJ', 'Azim T', 'Ameer SS', 'Chisti J', 'Andersson J']",2004,79,3,Am J Clin Nutr,"Raqib R, et al.

The most affected age groups were 0-11 months and 1-4 years, and the prevalent serotype was 2a, while serotype 6 was dominant in the 5-14 years age group. More cases were registered during the hot season, and there were some serotype-related variations. Overall, 62.1% of the samples were from male patients. Serotype 1b was dominant in the male/female ratio, although it was third in general prevalence. According to the H/Od serotype 2a was more common in hospitalized males and serotype 6 in outpatients, both male and female. These variations, as well as changes in serotype prevalence in the past, underscore the importance of serotype monitoring as part of the public health strategies for reducing the burden of Shigella flexneri infections.","['Vasilev V', 'Andorn N', 'Japheth R', 'Agmon V']",2004,132,1,Epidemiol Infect,"Vasilev V, et al.

14975529,Shigella flexneri infection: pathogenesis and vaccine development.,"Shigella flexneri is a gram-negative bacterium which causes the most communicable of bacterial dysenteries, shigellosis. Shigellosis causes 1.1 million deaths and over 164 million cases each year, with the majority of cases occurring in the children of developing nations. The pathogenesis of S. flexneri is based on the bacteria's ability to invade and replicate within the colonic epithelium, which results in severe inflammation and epithelial destruction. The molecular mechanisms used by S. flexneri to cross the epithelial barrier, evade the host's immune response and enter epithelial cells have been studied extensively in both in vitro and in vivo models. Consequently, numerous virulence factors essential to bacterial invasion, intercellular spread and the induction of inflammation have been identified in S. flexneri. The inflammation produced by the host has been implicated in both the destruction of the colonic epithelium and in controlling and containing the Shigella infection. The host's humoral response to S. flexneri also appears to be important in protecting the host, whilst the role of the cellular immune response remains unclear. The host's immune response to shigellosis is serotype-specific and protective against reinfection by the same serotype, making vaccination a possibility. Since the 1940s vaccines for S. flexneri have been developed with little success, however, the growing understanding of S. flexneri's pathogenesis and the host's immune response is assisting in the generation of more refined vaccine strategies. Current research encompasses a variety of vaccine types, which despite disparity in their efficacy and safety in humans represent promising progress in S. flexneri vaccine development.","['Jennison AV', 'Verma NK']",2004,28,1,FEMS Microbiol Rev,Jennison AV and Verma NK.

14964404,Bloody diarrhoea cases caused by Shigella and amoeba in Jordan.,"This study was done to evaluate the occurrence of bloody diarrhoea in Jordan in the period 1988-2000, with particular interest in Shigilla and amoeba cases in relation to the surveillance control system and hygiene policy. The cases were collected from various medical diagnostic laboratories. In addition to the clinical presentation, stool specimens or rectal swabs were collected and sub-cultured on the appropriate media. Shigella spp. and amoeba were identified using standard methods. Anti-microbial susceptibility tests were performed. One-way ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) were used for statistical analysis. The number of stool specimens tested for bloody diarrhoea was 34,529 in the study period. Positive stool samples were reported in 711 (2.1%) patients. Out of these 55% were males and 45 % were females. The highest number of cases 96 (13.5%) was reported in the year 1999. The highest incidence rate was (20.6) in the year 1996 and the lowest incidence rate (8.9) was in the year 2000. The highest number of cases during the period 1998-1992 was among age group 1-4 year. During the year 1993-1996 the highest number of cases was among group 5-14 year. The highest number of cases during the year 1997-2000 was among age group 15-24 year. There was a significant variation between numbers of bloody diarrhoeal cases and age groups (P < 0.001) as well as sex (P = 0.028). No significant variation (P = 0.06) was observed between number of bloody diarrhoea cases and seasons or months. The number of stool specimens tested for amoebiasis during the study period 1994-2000 was 229,040. Shigella was isolated from 304(0.13%) cases and amoeba was found in 24,211(10.6%) cases. The lowest incidence rate in bloody diarrhoeal cases in the year 2000 indicates good quality hygienic control. The increased resistance of Shigella to antibiotics may produce a future problem, which might require a further prescribing policy for treatment.",['Battikhi MN'],2004,27,1,New Microbiol,Battikhi MN.

14769645,Household outbreaks among culture-confirmed cases of bacterial gastrointestinal disease.,"To examine the general frequency of household outbreaks, the authors performed a retrospective search among cases of the five most frequent gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens in Denmark, a country of 5.3 million inhabitants. This was done for 57,667 cases registered from 1991 to 2001 by finding all cases that shared addresses and became infected within 3 weeks of one another. The percentage of cases that were part of household outbreaks was found to be 3.2% for Campylobacter, 13.3% for Salmonella serotype Enteritidis, 5.6% for Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, 2.0% for Yersinia enterocolitica, and 10.4% for Shigella sonnei. The vast majority of the outbreaks had not previously been registered. The wide variation in the ability to cause household outbreaks among the different types of bacteria reflects differences in their epidemiology and most likely also mirrors their overall outbreak potential. Differences in the time occurring between infections of household members may also indicate differences in the importance of person-to-person transmission for the different types of bacteria. The fact that household outbreaks occur with a relatively high frequency may be utilized in future analyses of sources of infection, in particular of Campylobacter, for which more household outbreaks than expected were identified.","['Ethelberg S', 'Olsen KE', 'Gerner-Smidt P', 'Mølbak K']",2004,159,4,Am J Epidemiol,"Ethelberg S, et al.

The primary objectives of this trial were to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine and to determine the duration of colonization. Four of 34 volunteers experienced transient fevers, and three reported diarrhea during the first 3 days of the study. Half of the volunteers mounted a positive serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) response to S. flexneri lipopolysaccharide. All but one of the volunteers excreted the vaccine in their stools for 1 to 33 days, and this excretion was often intermittent. Data from the community-based study were supplemented with an inpatient trial in which three volunteers received 10(3) and nine received 10(4) CFU. All volunteers who received 10(3) CFU excreted SC602 and had an IgA antibody-secreting cell response. Two of these had a serum IgA response. Six of the nine volunteers who received 10(4) CFU excreted SC602. One vaccinee had a transient fever and two met the definition of diarrhea. Six volunteers that received 10(4) CFU had an antibody-secreting cell response, and four had a serum IgA response. SC602 has now been tested at 10(4) CFU in a total of 58 volunteers. The cumulative results of these clinical trials, reported here and previously (Coster et al., Infect. Immun. 67:3437-3443, 1999), have demonstrated that SC602 is a substantially attenuated candidate vaccine that can evoke protection against the most severe symptoms of shigellosis in a stringent human challenge model of disease.","['Katz DE', 'Coster TS', 'Wolf MK', 'Trespalacios FC', 'Cohen D', 'Robins G', 'Hartman AB', 'Venkatesan MM', 'Taylor DN', 'Hale TL']",2004,72,2,Infect Immun,"Katz DE, et al.

14685373,[Study of in vitro antimicrobial resistance of positive coprocultures to Shigella sp].,"BACKGROUND: The gastroenteritis caused by Shigella sp (shigellosis) represents an important cause of morbimortality, especially in children under two years old. It is well known that the proper antimicrobial therapy can improve clinical state and diminish the disease dissemination. Increasing levels of resistance to drugs commonly used in the treatment of shigellosis have been described, and its sensibility has not been recently evaluated in our setting.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Shigella antimicrobial resistance in our setting.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using 106 coprocultures of patients, hospitalized or not, who have been assisted at HCPA and at HPV, during the period of 1994 to 1996, with the sensibility test done through the Kirby-Bauer technique of diffusion discs.
RESULTS: Out of the 106 coprocultures studied, 35 (33%) came from HPV and 71 (67%), from HCPA. Considering the species, 58.8% were S. flexneri, 39.6%, S. sonnei, 0.9%, S. disenteriae and 0.9%, S. boydii. The resistance levels to usually indicated antibiotics were: ampicillin -57.5%, trimethropim-sulfamethoxazol -75.5%, and nalidixic acid -7.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show significant (p<0.001) in vitro antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol and low resistance to nalidixic acid among Shigella sp. Thus, nalidixic acid may be an option to treat infections caused by resistant organisms.","['dos Santos BA', 'Pires Ade A', 'de Souza AR', 'Vives C', 'Barcellos SH', 'Dal Bo DJ']",1997,73,6,J Pediatr (Rio J),"dos Santos BA, et al.

AlkA was identified as an in vivo-induced gene by in vivo expression technology (IVET), but its virulence in Shigella flexneri was not reported. The purpose of this study was to identify the role of alkA gene in the pathogenesis of S. flexneri.
METHODS: PCR was used to amplify alkA gene of S. flexneri 2a and fragment 028pKm. The fragment was then transformed into 2457T05 strain, a S flexneri 2a strain containing Red recombination system, which was constructed with a recombinant suicide plasmid pXLkd46. By in vivo homologous recombination, alkA mutants were obtained and verified by PCR and sequencing. Intracellular survival assay and virulence assay were used to test the intracellular survival ability in HeLa cell model and the virulence in mice lung infection model respectively.
RESULTS: Deletion mutant of S. flexneri 2a alkA was successfully constructed by gamma Red recombination system. The mutant exhibited significant survival defects and much significant virulence defects in mice infection assay.
CONCLUSION: AlkA gene plays an important role in the infection of epithelial cells and is a virulent gene of Shigella spp.","['Shi ZX', 'Wang HL', 'Hu K', 'Feng EL', 'Yao X', 'Su GF', 'Huang PT', 'Huang LY']",2003,9,12,World J Gastroenterol,"Shi ZX, et al.

14644500,Identification and characterization of simple sequence repeats in the genomes of Shigella species.,"A variety of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been identified in the genome of Shigella flexneri serotype 2a (strain Sf301), an enteric pathogen that causes bacillary dysentery in man. The distribution of SSRs, with unit length ranging from 1 to 9 nucleotides, was biased in different regions of the genome. The tri-, tetra- and hexanucleotide SSRs prevailed in the coding regions while the mono- and dinucleotide SSRs were more common in the noncoding regions. Many intergenic SSRs are less than 30 bp away from the downstream open reading frames (ORFs), suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation. To study polymorphism of SSRs, we compared 17 coding-region SSRs from strain Sf301 with the corresponding sequences from 23 other strains of four Shigella species. Five chromosomal loci were found to be polymorphic, of which those from S. flexneri strains were most variable. Particularly interesting is the C5-1 locus in the coding sequence of the hcaD gene encoding a subunit of ferredoxin reductase. Depending on the insertion of variable numbers of the unit sequence (CGCAG), the Shigella hcaD genes can encode truncated products due to premature stop codons or frame shifts, or products with extended core alpha helices that leads to radical alterations in the predicted tertiary structure. Hence, SSRs may serve as genotyping markers for epidemiological investigations, and may offer insights into evolutionary adaptation of the pathogens.","['Yang J', 'Wang J', 'Chen L', 'Yu J', 'Dong J', 'Yao ZJ', 'Shen Y', 'Jin Q', 'Chen R']",2003,322,,Gene,"Yang J, et al.

Since human, the only natural host of S. dysenteriae type 1, recognized the protein through humoral immune response, it is of great significance to study the surface-exposed outer membrane antigen as an adjuvant. Porin treatment of CD11b+ peritoneal cavity (PerC) MPhi of BALB/c mouse was found to up-regulate CD80 on cell surface and had no effect on CD86 expression. The surface expression of CD80 got increased by 1.6-fold in the presence of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) supporting selective regulation of the B7-1 (CD80) member of the B7 family. MPhi released 7.25 pg of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in the presence of porin. The protein in combination with IFN-gamma augmented profoundly the release of IL-12 by 2.6-fold. Porin-mediated induction of IL-12 release would therefore influence Th1-type response, known to be preferentially triggered due to up-regulation of CD80 expression. Treatment of PerC MPhi by the protein showed an increase of mRNA for both Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) by 2- and 2.3-fold respectively, emphasizing that TLR2 is essential for recognition of S. dysenteriae type 1 porin.

With this aim, we have constructed five S. flexneri 5 (wild-type strain M90T) mutants with inactivation of one or two of the loci purEK, purHD, and guaBA, governing early or late steps of purine biosynthesis. The mutants have been analyzed in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in the Sereny test and in the murine pulmonary model of shigellosis. M90T guaBA, M90T guaBA purEK, M90T guaBA purHD, and M90T purHD purEK gave a negative result in the Sereny test. In contrast, in the murine pulmonary model all of the strains had the same 50% lethal dose as the wild type, except M90T guaBA purHD, which did not result in death of the animals. Nevertheless, bacterial counts in infected lungs, immunohistochemistry, and reverse transcription-PCR analysis of mRNAs for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-12, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) revealed significant differences among the strains. At 72 h postinfection, M90T guaBA purHD still induced proinflammatory cytokines and factors such as IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and iNOS, along with cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-gamma. Moreover, in the absence of evident lesions in murine tissues, this mutant highly stimulated major histocompatibility complex class II expression, showing a significant ability to activate the innate immunity of the host.","['Cersini A', 'Martino MC', 'Martini I', 'Rossi G', 'Bernardini ML']",2003,71,12,Infect Immun,"Cersini A, et al.

14638472,Epidemiology of nalidixic acid resistance and TEM-1- and TEM-52-mediated ampicillin resistance of Shigella sonnei isolates obtained in Korea between 1980 and 2000.,"The resistance to ampicillin and nalidixic acid in Shigella sonnei isolates obtained in Korea during the period 1998 to 2000 was characterized. Recently (J. Y. Oh, H. S. Yu, S. K. Kim, S. Y. Seol, D. T. Cho, and J. C. Lee, J. Clin. Microbiol. 41:421-423, 2003) ampicillin and nalidixic acid resistance was found in 49 and 70%, respectively, of the 67 S. sonnei isolates obtained during this period. We analyzed 138 S. sonnei isolates collected during the same period. Ampicillin and nalidixic acid resistance was found in 30 and 86% of the isolates, respectively. The ampicillin resistance was mediated by a TEM-1 beta-lactamase, and TEM-52 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was identified in one sporadic S. sonnei isolate from 1999. bla(TEM-1) and bla(TEM-52) were located in conjugative R-plasmids. Tn3 was detected in 41% of the ampicillin-resistant isolates. The R-plasmids from the transconjugants that transferred resistance to ampicillin exhibited different restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and a bla(TEM-1) probe was hybridized with the different fragments. The nalidixic acid resistance was exclusively associated with an amino acid substitution, Ser83-->Leu (TCG-->TTG), in gyrA. These findings indicate that the genetically related S. sonnei strains readily acquire resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole but not nalidixic acid through conjugative R-plasmids from difference sources when confronted by antibiotic selective pressures.","['Jeong YS', 'Lee JC', 'Kang HY', 'Yu HS', 'Lee EY', 'Choi CH', 'Tae SH', 'Lee YC', 'Cho DT', 'Seol SY']",2003,47,12,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Jeong YS, et al.

14638419,Shiga toxins and apoptosis.,"The enteric pathogens Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) cause bloody diarrheal diseases that may progress to life-threatening extraintestinal complications. Although the S. dysenteriae and STEC differ in the expression of a number of virulence determinants, they share the capacity to produce one or more potent cytotoxins, called Shiga toxins (Stxs). Following the ingestion of the organisms, the expression of Stxs is critical for the development of vascular lesions in the colon, kidneys and central nervous system. It has been known for some time that following the intracellular routing of Stxs to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane, the toxins translocate into the cytoplasm and target ribosomes for damage. However, numerous recent studies have shown that Stxs trigger programmed cell death signaling cascades in intoxicated cells. The mechanisms of apoptosis induction by these toxins are newly emerging, and the data published to date suggest that the toxins may signal apoptosis in different cells types via different mechanisms. Here we review the Stxs and the known mechanistic aspects of Stx-induced apoptosis, and present a model of apoptosis induction.","['Cherla RP', 'Lee SY', 'Tesh VL']",2003,228,2,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Cherla RP, et al.

14633363,"Characterization of antimicrobial resistance, plasmids, and gene cassettes in Shigella spp. from patients in vietnam.","The objective of the study was to investigate antimicrobial resistance, plasmids and class 1 integrons in 150 Shigella strains isolated from patients with diarrhea in Vietnam. Most isolates were resistant to the majority of antimicrobial agents used for treatment in the isolation areas and 90% were resistant to three or more antibiotics. A total of 20 strains yielded class 1 integrons, which harbored oxa1, dfrA, orfF, and aadA gene cassettes. The most common gene cassette, aadA2, was always located closest to the 3' conserved segment of the integrons and oxa1 and dfrA closest to the 5' end. Plasmid profiles of the 20 class 1 integron-positive strains all contained more than one plasmid, and 14 different profiles were found. No correlation was found between species, antibiograms, plasmid profiles, or presence of class 1 integrons. Conjugation resulted in 25 transconjugants, which all were resistant to four or more antimicrobial agents and all harbored at least one plasmid (>60 kb). Class 1 integrons were detected in 64% of the transconjugants. Phenotypic resistance pattern and plasmid profiles of the transconjugants seemed independent of the presence of an integron. Class 1 integrons seemed of less importance in phenotypic antibiograms and in transfer of resistance genes than conjugative plasmids.","['Iversen J', 'Sandvang D', 'Srijan A', 'Cam PD', 'Dalsgaard A']",2003,9 Suppl 1,,Microb Drug Resist,"Iversen J, et al.

S. dysenteriae type 1, the dominant serotype in 1999 (76.4%), declined to 6.5% in 2002. On the other hand, S. dysenteriae types 2 to 12 were isolated with increasing frequencies of 19, 67, 73.5, and 87% in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively. Of these, types 2 and 4 were the most dominant serotypes, accounting for more than 18.7 and 28.5% of the total isolates, respectively. There was no isolation of serotypes 5, 7, 8, and 13 during this period. Twenty-eight (7.8%) of the isolates were atypical and agglutinated only with the polyvalent antiserum of S. dysenteriae. More than 98% of type 1 strains isolated between 1999 and 2001 were resistant to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and nalidixic acid. Among other serotypes of S. dysenteriae, Nal(r) type 2 strains were isolated in 2001 and 2002. Although heterogeneous plasmid profiles were obtained depending on the presence or absence of a single plasmid, core plasmids were defined for particular serotypes. On the other hand, the same plasmid profile was found to be shared by different serotypes. Interestingly, plasmid patterns of types 2 and 4 were almost identical except that a middle-range plasmid of 70 to 60 MDa was present in type 4 in addition to the core plasmids. All the strains harboring the 140-MDa plasmid were positive for the ipaH gene, had Congo red binding abilities, and were positive by the Sereny test, demonstrating their invasive properties.","['Talukder KA', 'Islam MA', 'Khajanchi BK', 'Dutta DK', 'Islam Z', 'Safa A', 'Alam K', 'Hossain A', 'Nair GB', 'Sack DA']",2003,41,11,J Clin Microbiol,"Talukder KA, et al.

14572229,Consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.,"To be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. A four-round Delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. The food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Toxoplasma gondii, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. Hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. The avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Noroviruses, and Vibrio species. The expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their educational efforts.","['Hillers VN', 'Medeiros L', 'Kendall P', 'Chen G', 'DiMascola S']",2003,66,10,J Food Prot,"Hillers VN, et al.

14565136,[Specific prophylaxis of shigellosis].,"A high level of shigellosis morbidity requires new approaches to the control of bacterial dysentery.

In this article the data describing new approaches to the creation of new live enteric vaccines on the basis of the knowledge of the genetic control of microbial pathogenicity and the regulation of its expression are presented.

14562958,The evolutionary history of Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli revised.,"In Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC), the etiologic agents of shigellosis in humans, the determinants responsible for entry of bacteria into and dissemination within epithelial cells are encoded by a virulence plasmid. To understand the evolution of the association between the virulence plasmid and the chromosome, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using the sequences of four chromosomal genes (trpA, trpB, pabB, and putP) and three virulence plasmid genes (ipaB, ipaD, and icsA) of a collection of 51 Shigella and EIEC strains. The phylogenetic tree derived from chromosomal genes showed a typical ""star"" phylogeny, indicating a fast diversification of Shigella and EIEC groups. Phylogenetic groups obtained from the chromosomal and plasmidic genes were similar, suggesting that the virulence plasmid and the chromosome share similar evolutionary histories. The few incongruences between the trees could be attributed to exchanges of fragments of different plasmids and not to the transfer of an entire plasmid. This indicates that the virulence plasmid was not transferred between the different Shigella and EIEC groups. These data support a model of evolution in which the acquisition of the virulence plasmid in an ancestral E. coli strain preceded the diversification by radiation of all Shigella and EIEC groups, which led to highly diversified but highly specialized pathogenic groups.","['Escobar-Páramo P', 'Giudicelli C', 'Parsot C', 'Denamur E']",2003,57,2,J Mol Evol,"Escobar-Páramo P, et al.

14531895,The ShiA protein encoded by the Shigella flexneri SHI-2 pathogenicity island attenuates inflammation.,"Shigella spp. are the aetiologic agents of dysentery, a severe diarrhoeal syndrome characterized by acute inflammation in the colon. The inflammatory response, which includes recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), damages the colonic mucosa and exacerbates the infection. Shigella encodes a pathogenicity island (PAI), SHI-2, which is localized in a region of the chromosome linked to the induction of inflammation. Surprisingly, SHI-2 deletion mutants induce a stronger inflammatory response than wild-type Shigella as measured by increased villus blunting, increased PMN infiltration and induction of apoptosis in a rabbit ileal loop model of shigellosis. Mutational analysis mapped the hyper-inflammatory phenotype to a single gene, shiA. Similar to SHI-2 deletion mutants, infection with a shiA mutant strain induces dramatically elevated levels of inflammation when compared to the wild-type strain. Furthermore, infection with a wild-type strain containing multiple copies of shiA results in fewer infiltrating PMN and apoptotic cells, as well as preservation of a normal villus architecture at the site of infection, thus acting in a dominant fashion over the pro-inflammatory mechanisms of Shigella. The molecular mechanism of action of ShiA is independent of any in vitro phenotype associated with Shigella virulence. Our data suggest that ShiA allows Shigella to attenuate the host inflammatory response in a novel manner.","['Ingersoll MA', 'Moss JE', 'Weinrauch Y', 'Fisher PE', 'Groisman EA', 'Zychlinsky A']",2003,5,11,Cell Microbiol,"Ingersoll MA, et al.

12926313,[Dysentery in Poland in 2001].,"The notified number of dysentery cases is still very low, similar to the number reported in 2000. Only 128 cases were notified in the year 2001 (incidence 0.33/100,000 population) while 121 cases were notified in 2000 (incidence 0.31/100,000). No death due to dysentery was notified. The last three death cases were notified in 1999. Only one outbreak of foodborne infection due to S. sonnei involving 28 patients was registered, less than in 2000 when 2 outbreaks, one due to S. flexneri and one due to S. sonnei, and less than in 1999, when four outbreaks involving 146 patients were registered.

12913770,Safety and immunogenicity of Shigella sonnei-CRM9 and Shigella flexneri type 2a-rEPAsucc conjugate vaccines in one- to four-year-old children.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Shigella conjugate vaccines have been shown to be safe, immunogenic and efficacious in adult volunteers. We have now investigated the safety and immunogenicity of investigational Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri 2a conjugate vaccines in 1- to 4-year-old children, the age group at greatest risk for shigellosis.
METHODS: The O-specific polysaccharides of S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a, the two most common shigellae from patients in Israel, were bound to medically useful carrier proteins to form conjugates. Eighty healthy 1- to 4-year-olds were randomized to receive two 0.5-ml im injections 6 weeks apart of either S. sonnei-CRM(9) or S. flexneri 2a-rEPA(succ). Blood was taken before, 6 weeks after the first injection, 4 weeks after the second injections and 2 years after immunization for assay of IgG anti-lipopolysaccharide, diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: During an 8-day surveillance period after each immunization, low fever (37.8-39.0 degrees C) lasting only 24 to 48 h occurred in 2 of 40 recipients after the first injection and 4 of 40 recipients after the second injection of S. flexneri 2a-rEPA(succ) and in 2 of 38 of S. sonnei-CRM(9) after the second injection; no fever was detected after the first injection. Liver function tests were normal in all vaccinees. S. sonnei-CRM(9) elicited a >4-fold rise in IgG anti-LPS in 92.1% and S. flexneri 2a-rEPA(succ) in 85% (P < 0.0001) after the second injection; both conjugates elicited type-specific booster responses. At 2 years the geometric mean concentrations of both IgG anti-lipopolysaccharides were significantly higher than preimmunization levels. A >4-fold rise of IgG anti-diphtheria (65.8%) and IgG anti-ETA (77.5%) was observed.
CONCLUSION: These experimental Shigella conjugate vaccines were safe and immunogenic in 1- to 4-year-old children.","['Passwell JH', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Harlev E', 'Miron D', 'Ramon R', 'Farzam N', 'Lerner-Geva L', 'Levi Y', 'Chu C', 'Shiloach J', 'Robbins JB', 'Schneerson R', 'Israel Shigella Study Group']",2003,22,8,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Passwell JH, et al.

When introduced into the serotype Y isolate, the glucosyltransferase (gtr) II gene of the serotype 2a isolate is capable of inducing the conversion from serotype Y to 2a. In contrast, the gtrII of the serotype Y isolate lacks the capacity to change serotype, resulting from a Cys-->Tyr substitution in its predicted protein sequence.

Anti-HAV and anti-HBc IgM were detected in specimens of saliva from patients with serologically confirmed viral hepatitis A and B in 100% of cases. The presence of HBsAg in saliva from hepatitis B patients was established in 95.4% of cases. In blood serum and in specimens of saliva anti-HCV IgM were detected in 100% and 85.7% of cases respectively. Out of 25 women with aggravated obstetric history, IgG antibodies to CMV were detected in blood serum in 23 women (88.5%) and in saliva in 22 women (84.6%). The results of these investigations revealed that the detection rate of antibodies in blood serum and saliva in cases of infections, both bacterial (brucellosis, shigellosis) and viral (hepatitis A, B, C and CMV infection), was not essentially different.

12877639,An evaluation of current shigellosis treatment.,"Shigellosis or bacillary dysentery, characterised by the passage of frequent loose stools mixed with blood and mucous, is caused by Shigella spp. which can be subdivided into four serotypes, namely, S. sonnei, S. boydii, S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae. S. dysenteriae type 1 produces severe dysentery and may be associated with many complications like leukaemoid reaction and haemolytic-ureamic syndrome. It is known to produce protracted epidemics and pandemics and is usually multi-drug resistant. Antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy of all cases of shigellosis. Antibiotics such as tetracycline, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole, were previously highly effective. Newer fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, azithromycin and ceftriaxone are effective. Although single dose of norfloxacin 800 mg and ciprofloxacin 1 g have been shown to be effective, they are currently less effective against S. dysenteriae type 1 infection. Oral rehydration salt should be given concurrently to prevent or correct dehydration. Antimotility agents are contraindicated. Feeding during and after shigellosis is emphasised. Hand-washing practices with plenty of water and soap help to prevent the transmission of infection from person to person. A search is on for an effective vaccine against shigella.","['Bhattacharya SK', 'Sur D']",2003,4,8,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Bhattacharya SK and Sur D. An evaluation of current shigellosis treatment.

12869210,Myocarditis related to Campylobacter jejuni infection: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Myocarditis can develop as a complication of various infections and is most commonly linked to enterovirus infections. Myocarditis is rarely associated with bacterial infections; salmonellosis and shigellosis have been the most frequently reported bacterial cause. We report a case of myocarditis related to Campylobacter jejuni enteritis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old previously healthy man presented with a history of prolonged chest pain radiating to the jaw and the left arm. Five days prior to the onset of chest pain, he developed bloody diarrhea, fever and chills. Creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB were elevated to 289 U/L and 28.7 microg/L. Troponin I was 30.2 microg/L. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T wave inversion in the lateral and inferior leads. The chest pain resolved within 24 hours of admission. The patient had a completely normal ECG stress test. The patient was initiated on ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid when Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from the stool. Diarrhea resolved within 48 hours of initiation of ciprofloxacin. The diagnosis of Campylobacter enteritis and related myocarditis was made based on the clinical and laboratory results and the patient was discharged from the hospital in stable condition.
CONCLUSION: Myocarditis can be a rare but severe complication of infectious disease and should be considered as a diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes in the absence of underlying coronary disease. It can lead to cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. There are only a few reported cases of myocarditis associated with Campylobacter infection.","['Cunningham C', 'Lee CH']",2003,3,,BMC Infect Dis,Cunningham C and Lee CH.

12860454,The actin-based motility defect of a Shigella flexneri rmlD rough LPS mutant is not due to loss of IcsA polarity.,"Shigella flexneri requires the outer membrane protein IcsA(VirG) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for efficient actin-based motility (ABM) within mammalian cells which is essential for virulence. Wild type strains of S. flexneri 2a such as 2457T have smooth LPS whose O antigen (Oag) chains have two modal lengths and IcsA predominantly located at one pole on their cell surface. In contrast, rough LPS mutants lack Oag chains, have IcsA on lateral and polar regions of the cell surface, and are defective for ABM. In this study we directly compared the phenotype of a S. flexneri producing non-IcsP/SopA cleavable IcsA (IcsA*) with that of a rough LPS mutant. IcsA* was located on lateral and polar regions of smooth LPS bacteria, and was fully functional in ABM assays (HeLa cell monolayer plaque and F-actin comet tail formation) which contrasts with the R-LPS phenotype. This indicates that loss of polar IcsA localisation in R-LPS mutants is unrelated to their ABM defect, and suggests that Oag may directly contribute to IcsA-mediated ABM.","['Van den Bosch L', 'Morona R']",2003,35,1,Microb Pathog,Van den Bosch L and Morona R.

Of these 161 isolates, 139 isolates were S. flexneri serotype 2a, and one-third of them (47 isolates) exhibited the outbreak pattern. The remaining 92 S. flexneri serotype 2a isolates displayed 49 different NotI-PFGE patterns. Forty-five patterns were closely related to the outbreak pattern, with deletions of three specific NotI fragments occurring with high frequency. While the outbreak strain remained the main cause of shigellosis after the outbreak, the continuous emergence of closely related though poorly transmissible strains from the outbreak strain contributed to the observed annual decrease of shigellosis in the area.","['Chen JH', 'Chiou CS', 'Chen PC', 'Liao TL', 'Liao TL', 'Li JM', 'Hsu WB']",2003,41,7,J Clin Microbiol,"Chen JH, et al.

12822380,Acute infectious diarrhea in children.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute infectious diarrhea is a global health problem especially in infants and children, and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The ethiology of acute infectious diarrhea and also biochemical, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children dying with infectious diarrhea are investigated in this study.
METHODS: 201 children, aged from 6 months to 14 years, with acute infectious diarrhea admitted to the Infectious Diseases Clinic in Tuzla in the period from 21st December 1999 to 21st December 2000 were included in the study.
RESULTS: Enteropathogens were identified in stool samples in 103 (51.3%) of 201 examined children. Viruses were identified in 51 (25.4%) cases, bacteria in 44 (21.9%), fungi in 3 (1.5%), and parasites in 2 (1%). Rotavirus, a frequent pathogen, was detected in 48 cases (23.9%), followed by Salmonella species in 20 (10%), EPEC in 10 (4.9%), and Shigella species in 9 (4.5%) cases. In this study the authors noticed that the highest morbidity was recorded in children in the first 2 years of life (70.5%), and among rural community (68.4%). The detection of rotavirus decreased with increasing age of cases and peaked in winter and autumn. Blood in stool was most common in children with shigellosis (22.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: High percentage of infants and children dying with acute infectious diarrhea presents a serious socio-economic and medical problem in Tuzla region of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rotavirus is the single most common pathogen in children with infectious diarrhea.","['Ahmetagic S', 'Jusufovic E', 'Petrovic J', 'Stojic V', 'Delibegovic Z']",2003,57,2,Med Arh,"Ahmetagic S, et al.

12816201,Progress in the prevention and control of diarrhoeal diseases since Independence.,"Acute diarrhoeal diseases constitute one of the major health problems among young children in India. It was estimated in 1978 that 1.5 million children under the age of 5 years die due to diarrhoea every year, which declined to 0.6-0.7 million in the estimate revised in 1992. A similar declining trend has also been noted in hospitalized cases in Calcutta (present Kolkata) during 1980-95 as well as from other parts of India. Even today, cholera epidemics occur regularly in India. The cholera epidemic caused by a novel strain of Vibrio cholerae, designated as V. cholerae 0139 Bengal in 1992 and multidrug-resistant shigellosis in eastern India in 1984 are matters of grave concern. The launching of the National Diarrhoeal Diseases Control Programme (CDD) in 1978, based on a three-tier approach, is of great importance. The rate of use of oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution and oral rehydration therapy (ORT) remain suboptimal in India. In spite of the launching of the 'Ganga Action Plan' and the 'National River Action Plan', India faces a major problem of diarrhoeal diseases. Lack of safe water supply, poor environmental sanitation, improper disposal of human excreta and poor personal hygiene help to perpetuate and spread diarrhoeal diseases in India. Since diarrhoeal diseases are caused by 20-25 pathogens, vaccination, though an attractive disease prevention strategy, is not feasible. However, as the majority of childhood diarrhoeas are caused by V. cholerae, Shigellae dysenteriae type 1, rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) which have a high morbidity and mortality, vaccines against these organisms are essential for the control of epidemics. A strong political will with appropriate budgetary allocation is essential for the control of childhood diarrhoeal diseases in India, a formidable task in a country with a population of over 1 billion.",['Bhattacharya SK'],2003,16 Suppl 2,,Natl Med J India,Bhattacharya SK.

12814438,A newborn mouse model for the study of intestinal pathogenesis of shigellosis.,"Shigella infection is characterized by the induction of acute inflammation, which is responsible for the massive tissue destruction of the intestinal mucosa. A murine model would be a valuable tool for gaining a better understanding of the physiopathology of shigellosis and the host immune response to Shigella infection, but adult mice do not develop disease upon oral inoculation. We therefore attempted to develop a model of infection in newborn mice. Four-day-old mice inoculated with 50 microl of 5 x 10(9) invasive wild-type Shigella flexneri 5a were susceptible to bacterial infection, but mice inoculated with the non-invasive strain BS176 were not. Histologically, 4-day-old mice infected with the invasive strain presented intestinal lesions and inflammation similar to those described in patients with shigellosis. Moreover, cytokine and chemokine responses consistent with inflammation were observed. Lower bacterial inocula induced less severe intestinal damage. In contrast, 5-day-old mice inoculated with either the invasive or the non-invasive strain were not infected. We have thus established a mouse model that is suitable for the study of the pathogenesis of intestinal Shigella infection.","['Fernandez MI', 'Thuizat A', 'Pedron T', 'Neutra M', 'Phalipon A', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2003,5,7,Cell Microbiol,"Fernandez MI, et al.

12813033,The invasive phenotype of Shigella flexneri directs a distinct gene expression pattern in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2.,"Invasion of the human colonic epithelium by Shigella flexneri causes inflammation that disrupts the intestinal barrier. Invaded intestinal epithelial cells are the major source of mediators recruiting the inflammatory infiltrate. To better characterize the global response of intestinal epithelial cells to Shigella invasion, Caco-2 cells were infected by an invasive isolate of S. flexneri 5a, and their transcriptome was analyzed by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) microarrays (12,000 genes) and compared with these elicited by a non-invasive Shigella mutant and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The invasive and non-invasive strains enhanced transcription of a common pattern of 240 genes, among which genes encoding isoforms of cytochrome P-450 were induced. These genes were not induced by TNF-alpha. Conversely, both the invasive strain and TNF-alpha induced a common set of 18 genes, mainly encoding proinflammatory molecules. They also induced specific sets of genes. The transcriptome induced by the invasive strain was characterized by the induction of early genes (i.e. expressed within the first 45 min of invasion) and late genes (i.e. after 60 min of invasion) whose pattern was strongly biased toward stimulation of granulopoiesis, chemoattraction, activation, and adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. When compared with a non-invasive Shigella and TNF-alpha, invasive Shigella induced a narrow transcriptome that seems to program infected epithelial cells to recruit a mucosal polymorphonuclear leukocyte to infiltrate. Dramatic increase in IL-8 gene transcription points to this chemokine as the major molecule orchestrating mucosal inflammation in shigellosis.","['Pédron T', 'Thibault C', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2003,278,36,J Biol Chem,"Pédron T, et al.

12800254,Identification of RanBMP interacting with Shigella flexneri IpaC invasin by two-hybrid system of yeast.,"AIM: Bacillary dysentery caused by Shigella flexneri is still a threat to human health. Of four invasion plasmid antigen proteins (IpaA,B,C and D), IpaC plays an important role in the pathogenicity of this pathogen. The purpose of this study was to investigate the proteins interacting with IpaC in the host cell during the pathogenic process of this disease.
METHODS: By applying two-hybrid system, the bait plasmid containing ipaC gene was constructed and designated pGBKT-ipaC. The bait plasmid was transformed AH109, and proved to express IpaC and then HeLa cDNA library plasmids were introduced into the above transformed AH109. The transformation mixture was plated on medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His in the initial screen, then restreaked on medium lacking Trp, Leu, His and Ade. Colonies growing on the selection medium were further assayed for beta-galactosidase activity. BLAST was carried out in the database after sequencing the inserted cDNA of the positive library plasmid.
RESULTS: Among the 2X10(6) transformants, 64 positive clones were obtained as determined by activation of His, Ade and LacZ reporter genes. Sequence analysis revealed that cDNA inserts of two colonies were highly homologous to a known human protein, RanBPM.
CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that IpaC may be involved in the invasion process of S. flexneri by interacting with RanBPM, and RanBPM is most likely to be the downstream target of IpaC in the cascade events of S. flexneri infection.","['Yao X', 'Wang HL', 'Shi ZX', 'Yan XY', 'Feng EL', 'Yang BL', 'Huang LY']",2003,9,6,World J Gastroenterol,"Yao X, et al.

Though protective mechanism in shigellosis is not established with certainty, outer membrane proteins (specially 38, 34, 23 and 20kDa proteins) may be the major antigens in the induction of protective immune responses as indicated by this observation.","['Mukhopadhaya A', 'Mahalanabis D', 'Khanam J', 'Chakrabarti MK']",2003,21,21-22,Vaccine,"Mukhopadhaya A, et al.

Our previous studies show extensive microvascular changes in rectal mucosal vasculature of patients with acute infective diarrhea (Mathan and Mathan 1985a, Gut 26:710-717). We looked for changes in the duodenal mucosal vasculature in two naturally occurring diarrheal infections: shigellosis and cholera. Duodenal mucosal biopsies from 14 patients with shigellosis, 12 patients with cholera, and 10 healthy volunteers were examined under the electron microscope. There were extensive microvascular changes in the duodenum in shigellosis and cholera. Congestion and dilatation of capillaries and venules, stagnation of blood, thinning of the endothelial lining, and platelet clumping were commonly seen in both conditions. Endothelial damage was also common to both conditions but was mild to moderate in cholera and severe in shigellosis with frank hemorrhage, frequent formation of stress fibers, widening of intercellular spaces, cytoplasmic blebbing, cell fragmentation, and intravascular thrombosis. Erythrocyte aggregates, platelet aggregates, and leucocyte plugging lead to capillary obstruction. The arterioles were severely constricted. These changes in the endothelial lining of the microvasculature could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease resulting in peripheral vascular insufficiency, inadequate oxygen delivery to intestine, and organ dysfunction. The factors influencing these changes, their implications, and possible therapeutic interventions are discussed.","['Koshi R', 'Chandy G', 'Mathan M', 'Mathan VI']",2003,16,4,Clin Anat,"Koshi R, et al.

12787734,"Prevalence and molecular diversity of pHS-2 plasmids, marker for arthritogenicity, among clinical Escherichia coli Shigella isolates.","Reactive arthritis can occur after numerous bacterial infections, including bacillary dysentery caused by Escherichia coli Shigella. A major risk factor for the disease is the HLA B27 phenotype in the human host. By comparison between plasmid profiles of arthritogenic vs. nonarthritogenic Shigella strains, the pHS-2 plasmid has been previously associated with the arthritogenic capacity of Shigella isolates. However, the prevalence of this plasmid in the various Shigella biotypes and serotypes is largely unknown. On this background, 188 clinical isolates from intestinal disease representing all 46 Shigella serogroups were studied for the presence of the pHS-2 plasmid, using PCR, dot blot and Southern blot techniques and by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The pHS-2 plasmid was found in nine of 14 E. coli Flexneri serogroups, in E. coli Dysenteriae 1 and in E. coli Boydii 16. In addition, we show marked variability of this plasmid in E. coli Flexneri 3A and 4A strains. Major biological diversity of the pHS-2 plasmid was found to be strictly related to Shigella serogroups. The prevalence pattern of the pHS-2 plasmid matches published data on arthritogenic Shigella isolates, providing additional indirect evidence for the potential validity of this plasmid as a marker for arthritogenicity.","['Adam T', 'Siewerdt R', 'Offermann I', 'Lang J', 'Tschäpe H', 'Sieper J', 'Graf B']",2003,5,7,Microbes Infect,"Adam T, et al.

However, the mechanism of the shigellocidal action of this plant remains to be understood. This study investigated the effects of O. gratissimum essential oil (EO) at subinhibitory concentrations of 0.75 and 1.0 microg/ml on virulence and multidrug-resistant strains of 22 Shigella isolates from Nigeria. Compared with untreated Shigella strains, O. gratissimum EO caused significant decreases (p<0.01) in extracellular protease activity, o-lipopolysaccharide rhamnose content and incidence of invasiveness mediated as keratoconjunctivitis in guinea pig. The disparity in extracellular protease activity and o-lipopolysacharide rhamnose between the two treatment groups was also found to be significant (p<0.05), suggesting greater anti-virulent effects of O. gratissimum oil at 1.0 microg/ml. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that the EO of O. gratissimum reduced the MICs of antibiotics to which Shigellae showed resistance by 9.8-53.1% and fluoroquinolones by 18.2-45.5%. The results of this study strongly suggest inhibition of extracellular protease and expression of O-LPS rhamnose in Shigellae by O. gratissimum EO.

12759714,[Diseases of Compulsory Notification (DCN) in Navarra. 2002].,"Since 1998, the Epidemiological Survelliance System of Navarra has included the notification of 34 transmissible infectious diseases, to which are added epidemic outbreaks of any aetiology and cause. Reporting to the system is carried out on a weekly basis by every doctor who suspects, or diagnoses, any of these processes. In our autonomous community, Diseases of Compulsory Notification (DCN) are reported using standardised forms on a weekly basis to the Section of Infectious Diseases and Control of Outbreaks of the Public Health Institute. Notification is made by the doctors and/or paediatricians of Primary Care and by certain services of Specialised Care. Subsequently, the information is sent to the National Epidemiology Centre where data from the Autonomous Communities is centralised and diffused. The year 2002 marks the fifth year of the new Epidemiological Vigilance System. In these five years there have been 74,814 notifications of disease, 17,184 in the year 2002, which provides a balance of notification of 74.07% for this year. In 2002, under the heading of respiratory transmitted diseases, 24,870 cases of Inluenza were reported, Epidemic Index (EI: 0.80). 58% of total annual cases were reported in the first nine weeks of the year, with a maximum in week 4 when 3,277 cases were reported. 16 cases of Meningococcal Disease were reported to the system (EI: 1.07). All the cases were confirmed microbiologically and all appeared in a sporadic way. With respect to the causative serogroup, on 12 occasions Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B was isolated and in the 4 remaining cases serogroup C was isolated. One case was notified in infants of less than 2 years of age (Rate: 10.52 cases per 100,000), another case in children between 2 and 5 years (5.52 cases per 100,000), 5 cases in the age group of 6 to 19 years (Rate: 5.86 cases per 100,000) and the remaining nine cases in the age group of persons aged 20 years or over (2.2 per 100,000). 70 cases of Legionellosis were declared in 2002 (EI: 4.67), all but one under the clinical form of pneumonia. Twenty-two of the cases were presented in the context of two outbreaks with a community origin, which affected 17 and 5 persons respectively. Similarly, there was a notable increase in the declaration of cases of bacillary dysentery, with 6 cases (EI: 2.00), brucellosis, with 10 cases (EI: 1.67) and chickenpox, with 4,346 notified cases (EI: 1.61).","['Urtiaga M', 'Irisarri F', 'Zabala A']",2003,26,1,An Sist Sanit Navar,"Urtiaga M, et al.

12757222,Bacterial enteric pathogens in children with acute dysentery in Thailand: increasing importance of quinolone-resistant Campylobacter.,"Current data on pathogen prevalence and drug resistance patterns are important for treatment and vaccine-development strategies. An etiologic study of acute bacterial dysentery was conducted in children up to 12 years of age in 2 major hospitals in and around Bangkok. Stool samples or rectal swabs and clinical data were collected. Standard microbiological methods were used to detect Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas. Pathogenic E. coli (ETEC, EIEC, STEC) was identified by digoxigenin-labeled probes. A total of 623 cases were enrolled: median age 11.0 months (range 1 month-12 years). At least one bacterial pathogen was isolated in 55% of cases. Campylobacter was the most common pathogen found (28%), whereas Salmonella, Shigella and ETEC were isolated from 18%, 9% and 6% respectively. EIEC, Vibrio and Plesiomonas were isolated from <1% and no STEC was detected. C. jejuni serotypes 36, 4 and 11 were the most common. The mean age of cases with Campylobacter was significantly lower than with Shigella (17.9 vs 52.8 months, p<0.001). Clinical presentations of Campylobacter and Shigella infections were compared: fever (28% vs 37%), abdominal colic (62% vs 80%, p<0.05), vomiting (38% vs 70%, p<0.001) and bloody stools (52% vs 48%). The Campylobacter isolates (80% C. jejuni, 20% C. coli) were 90% resistant to ciprofloxacin but sensitive to macrolides. All the Shigella isolates (70% S. sonnei) were sensitive to quinolones. Our study illustrates the increasing importance of quinolone-resistant Campylobacter and the decline of Shigella in the etiology of dysentery in Thailand. The clinical presentation of campylobacteriosis is similar to that of shigellosis, except that the patients may be younger and there may be less association with colic and vomiting; having fecal leukocytes will be >10/HPF. The use of macrolide antibiotics rather than quinolones would be reasonable in children <24 months of age; fluoroquinolones will be ineffective in at least half of culture-positive cases.","['Bodhidatta L', 'Vithayasai N', 'Eimpokalarp B', 'Pitarangsi C', 'Serichantalergs O', 'Isenbarger DW']",2002,33,4,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,"Bodhidatta L, et al.

12751672,Aetiology of shigellosis in northern Pakistan.,"People of northern Pakistan face health hazards because of poor sanitation practices. Bacterial gastrointestinal infections are very common, and sometimes outbreaks occur. The present study was aimed at evaluating and analyzing infestation of Shigella spp. in patients with suspected gastroenteritis and ascertaining the status of antibiotic therapy. Five hundred and eighty-five faecal samples of patients with suspected gastroenteritis, referred to the District Headquarter Hospital Gilgit, were investigated for common enteropathogenic bacteria from July 1997 to September 1999. Seventy-seven (13.2%) of the faecal specimens were infected with different strains of Shigella spp., 61% of which were Shigella dysenteriae, 15.6% were S. flexneri, and 23.4% were Shigella sp. All Shigella strains were sensitive to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and enoxacin. Sixty-one percent of the strains were resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and 3.9% to ampicillin and nalidixic acid, while 10.4% were resistant to ampicillin alone and 14.3% to chloramphenicol only. Only 10.4% of the strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. Sixty strains of Shigella spp. were processed for isolation of plasmids, and 58 (97%) of these antibiotic-resistant bacteria harboured at least one plasmid. The number of plasmids varied from 1 to 9. Escherichia coli C600 were transformed with the isolated plasmids. Transformants, containing 23-kb plasmid, resisted growth in media containing antibiotics, thereby indicating that antibiotic resistance is plasmid-borne. Based on the findings of the study, it is concluded that the infestation of Shigella spp. is high in northern Pakistan, the aetiological agents are highly resistant to chloramphenicol and ampicillin, and the antibiotic resistance is mediated by the 23-kb plasmid.","['Ahmed K', 'Shakoori FR', 'Shakoori AR']",2003,21,1,J Health Popul Nutr,"Ahmed K, et al.

12726975,Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review.,"We set out to determine the impact of washing hands with soap on the risk of diarrhoeal diseases in the community with a systematic review with random effects meta-analysis. Our data sources were studies linking handwashing with diarrhoeal diseases. Seven intervention studies, six case-control, two cross-sectional, and two cohort studies were located from electronic databases, hand searching, and the authors' collections. The pooled relative risk of diarrhoeal disease associated with not washing hands from the intervention trials was 1.88 (95% CI 1.31-2.68), implying that handwashing could reduce diarrhoea risk by 47%. When all studies, when only those of high quality, and when only those studies specifically mentioning soap were pooled, risk reduction ranged from 42-44%. The risks of severe intestinal infections and of shigellosis were associated with reductions of 48% and 59%, respectively. In the absence of adequate mortality studies, we extrapolate the potential number of diarrhoea deaths that could be averted by handwashing at about a million (1.1 million, lower estimate 0.5 million, upper estimate 1.4 million). Results may be affected by the poor quality of many of the studies and may be inflated by publication bias. On current evidence, washing hands with soap can reduce the risk of diarrhoeal diseases by 42-47% and interventions to promote handwashing might save a million lives. More and better-designed trials are needed to measure the impact of washing hands on diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in developing countries.","['Curtis V', 'Cairncross S']",2003,3,5,Lancet Infect Dis,Curtis V and Cairncross S.

12716215,Acute gastroenteritis in children : what role for antibacterials?,"The aim of this article is to define the currently accepted role of antibacterials in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children. Most cases of acute gastroenteritis in children are viral, self-limited, and need only supportive treatment. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, with close attention to nutrition, remain central to therapy.Antibacterial therapy serves as an adjunct, to shorten the clinical course, eradicate causative organisms, reduce transmission, and prevent invasive complications. Selection of antibacterials to use in acute bacterial gastroenteritis is based on clinical diagnosis of the likely pathogen prior to definitive laboratory results. Antibacterial therapy should be restricted to specific bacterial pathogens and disease presentations. In general, infections with Shigella spp. and Vibrio cholera should usually be treated with antibacterials, while antibacterials are only used in severe unresponsive infections with Salmonella, Yersinia, Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Plesiomonas spp., and Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials should be avoided in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection. However, empiric therapy may be appropriate in the presence of a severe illness with bloody diarrhea and stool leucocytes, particularly in infancy and the immunocompromised. The benefits and risks of adverse drug reactions should be weighed before prescribing antibacterials. Moreover, a major concern is the emergence of antibacterial-resistant strains due to the widespread use of antibacterial agents.","['Phavichitr N', 'Catto-Smith A']",2003,5,5,Paediatr Drugs,Phavichitr N and Catto-Smith A.

Adult patients had increased infiltration of mucosal mast cells (MMC) at the acute stage (3 to 5 days after the onset of diarrhea) and eosinophils in early convalescence (14 to 16 days after onset). Increased expression of stem cell factor and prostaglandin H synthase-1 (PGHS-1) was associated with increased tryptase-K(i)67-double-positive MMC in the acute stage and increased apoptosis of MMC, which led to a rapid decline in early convalescence. The eosinophils demonstrated increased expression of major basic protein (MBP), eotaxin, and CCR3, as well as increased necrotic death. The neutrophils showed enhanced alpha-defensin and lactoferrin expression in the acute phase. In contrast to adults, the pediatric patients demonstrated delayed accumulation of mast cells and eosinophils, while alpha-defensin expression persisted during convalescence. In contrast, neutrophil counts and lactoferrin expression were reduced in children compared to adults. The results suggest that children with shigellosis have a persistent activation of the innate immune response in the convalescent phase, indicating delayed elimination of Shigella antigens compared to adults.","['Raqib R', 'Moly PK', 'Sarker P', 'Qadri F', 'Alam NH', 'Mathan M', 'Andersson J']",2003,71,5,Infect Immun,"Raqib R, et al.

12696674,Concurrent outbreaks of Shigella sonnei and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections associated with parsley: implications for surveillance and control of foodborne illness.,"In recent years, the globalization of the food supply and the development of extensive food distribution networks have increased the risk of foodborne disease outbreaks involving multiple states or countries. In particular, outbreaks associated with fresh produce have emerged as an important public health concern. During July and August 1998, eight restaurant-associated outbreaks of shigellosis caused by a common strain of Shigella sonnei occurred in the United States and Canada. The outbreak strain was characterized by unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Epidemiologic investigation determined that the illness was associated with the ingestion of parsley at four restaurants; at the other four restaurants, the majority of the people who contracted the illness ate parsley. Isolates from patrons in two unrelated restaurant-associated enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) outbreaks in Minnesota shared a common serotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern. Parsley was the implicated or suspected source of both ETEC outbreaks. In each of the outbreak-associated restaurants, parsley was chopped, held at room temperature, and used as an ingredient or garnish for multiple dishes. Infected food workers at several restaurants may also have contributed to the propagation of the outbreak. The sources of parsley served in outbreak-associated restaurants were traced, and a 1,600-acre farm in Baja California, Mexico, was identified as a likely source of the parsley implicated in six of the seven Shigella outbreaks and as a possible source of the parsley implicated in the two ETEC outbreaks. Global food supplies and large distribution networks demand strengthened laboratory and epidemiologic capacity to enable state and local public health agencies to conduct foodborne disease surveillance and to promote effective responses to multistate outbreaks.","['Naimi TS', 'Wicklund JH', 'Olsen SJ', 'Krause G', 'Wells JG', 'Bartkus JM', 'Boxrud DJ', 'Sullivan M', 'Kassenborg H', 'Besser JM', 'Mintz ED', 'Osterholm MT', 'Hedberg CW']",2003,66,4,J Food Prot,"Naimi TS, et al.

Outbreak strains exhibited two major antibiograms, 9 plasmid profiles, 10 enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence (ERIC)-PCR patterns, and 17 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. Of typing methods, ERIC-PCR types generally coincided with the PFGE types within these outbreak strains. However, ERIC-PCR analysis could not discriminate an epidemiologically unrelated strain from some outbreak strains. Further computer-assisted analysis for similarity of the PFGE patterns revealed that the main culprits of these four sequential outbreaks were strains of pulsotype C (88.2% of total outbreak isolates). The results indicate that PFGE can provide more explicit relatedness of outbreak strains than the other typing methods examined.

12624025,Epidemiology of tetracycline resistance determinants in Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli: characterization and dissemination of tet(A)-1.,"To make a comprehensive study of tetracycline resistance determinant distribution in the genus Shigella, a collection of 577 clinical isolates of Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) from a variety of geographical locations was screened to identify tetracycline-resistant strains. The 459 tetracycline-resistant isolates identified were then screened by PCR analysis to determine the distribution in these strains of tetracycline efflux resistance determinants belonging to classes A to E, G, and H that have been identified in gram-negative bacteria. Only classes A to D were represented in these strains. Although Tet B was the predominant determinant in all geographical locations, there were geographical and species differences in the distribution of resistance determinants. An allele of tet(A), designated tet(A)-1, was identified and sequenced, and the 8.6-kb plasmid containing determinant Tet A-1, designated pSSTA-1, was found to have homologies to portions of a Salmonella enterica cryptic plasmid and the broad-host-range resistance plasmid RSF1010. This allele and pSSTA-1 were used as epidemiological markers to monitor clonal and horizontal transmission of determinant Tet A-1. An analysis of serotype, distribution of tetracycline resistance determinants, and resistance profiles indicated that both clonal spread and horizontal transfer had contributed to the spread of specific tetracycline resistance determinants in these populations and demonstrated the use of these parameters as an epidemiological tool to follow the transmission of determinants and strains.","['Hartman AB', 'Essiet II', 'Isenbarger DW', 'Lindler LE']",2003,41,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Hartman AB, et al.

12608880,Treatment of infectious diarrhea in children.,"Diarrheal diseases remain an important cause of childhood morbidity and death in developing countries, although diarrheal deaths have significantly declined in recent years, mostly due to successes in the implementation of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which is the principal treatment modality. Diarrhea may occur for varied reasons; however, most episodes of diarrhea in developing countries are infectious in origin. Three clinical forms of diarrhea (acute watery diarrhea, invasive diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea) have been identified to formulate a management plan. Acute diarrhea may be watery (where features of dehydration are prominent) or dysenteric (where stools contain blood and mucus). Rehydration therapy is the key to management of acute watery diarrhea, whereas antimicrobial agents play a vital role in the management of acute invasive diarrhea, particularly shigellosis and amebiasis. In persistent diarrhea, nutritional therapy, including dietary manipulations, is a very important aspect in its management, in addition to rehydration therapy. Rehydration may be carried out either by the oral or intravenous route, depending upon the degree of dehydration. Oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution (World Health Organization formula) is recommended for ORT. Intravenous fluid is recommended for initial management of severe dehydration due to diarrhea, followed by ORT with ORS solution for correction of ongoing fluid losses. Antimicrobial therapy is beneficial for cholera and shigellosis. Antiparasitic agents are indicated only if amebiasis and giardiasis are present. Appropriate feeding during diarrhea is recommended for nutritional recovery and to prevent bodyweight loss. Antidiarrheal agents do not provide additional benefit in the management of infectious diarrhea. Although some probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of acute diarrhea due to rotavirus, their use in the treatment of diarrhea is yet to be recommended, even in developed countries. The children of developing countries might benefit from zinc supplementation during the diarrheal illness, but its mode of delivery and cost effectiveness are yet to be decided.","['Alam NH', 'Ashraf H']",2003,5,3,Paediatr Drugs,Alam NH and Ashraf H.

There is a need to monitor antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of enteric bacterial pathogens in order to ensure appropriate treatment and control of infections. The objectives of this study was to identify and determine the magnitude of potential enteric pathogens including Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter and other species in HIV-infected and HIV-non-infected patients with diarrhea, to evaluate the current antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the clinical isolates and the association of enteric bacterial pathogens in HIV infected patients with diarrhea. A cross-sectional study was conducted from Feb-July 2001 on 372 consecutive HIV seropositive and seronegative patients presenting at Jimma hospital for different illnesses. Patients were selected based on their serological tests for HIV. Sample of faeces specimens were collected and inoculated onto standard culture media as well as onto Skirrow's medium for isolation of Campylobacter species. Salmonella and Shigella species were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using disc agar diffusion technique recommended by Kirby-Bauer. Stool specimens were also smeared and stained by Zehl-Neelson staining technique for the identification of Mycobacterium species. Among the 99 HIV-infected patients with diarrhea, 25 (25.0%) of them had enteric bacteria among which 8(8.1%) were Salmonella, 4(4.0%) Shigella and 13(13.1%) Campylobacter species. Mycobacterium species were identified in 3(3.0%) of stool specimens obtained from HIV-infected patients with diarrhea and another 3 species were detected in HIV-infected patient without diarrhea. Salmonella species were isolated with higher prevalence in HIV-infected than in HIV non-infected patients. These Salmonella isolates were 100% susceptible to Amikacin, Gentamicin, Nalidixic acid and Kanamycin while Shigella isolates were 100% susceptible for Gentamycin and Kanamycin only. Unlike Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter species showed higher prevalence rates in HIV non-infected patients. Enteric bacterial pathogens account for about one fourth diarrhea in HIV infected patients in Jimma hospital. The finding of this investigation also confirmed earlier observations of wide spread resistance to the commonly used drugs in this region.","['Awole M', 'Gebre-Selassie S', 'Kassa T', 'Kibru G']",2002,40,4,Ethiop Med J,"Awole M, et al.

Since attenuated strains of Shigella have been developed as live oral vaccines against shigellosis, we have adapted these attenuated Shigella strains to serve as carriers of ETEC antigens, thereby constituting a hybrid vaccine. Since protective immunity against ETEC is largely directed against fimbrial antigens (of which there are multiple antigenic types), we have individually expressed four different ETEC fimbriae, including CFA/I, CS2, CS3, and CS4, using deltaguaBA attenuated Shigella vaccine strain CVD 1204 as a prototype live vector. Following mucosal (intranasal) immunization of guinea pigs, serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses were elicited against each fimbrial type. An additional strain was constructed expressing a detoxified version of the human ETEC variant of heat labile toxin (LThK63). Following mucosal immunization of guinea pigs with a mixed inoculum containing five Shigella strains each expressing a different ETEC antigen, immune responses were observed against each ETEC antigen plus the Shigella vector.","['Barry EM', 'Altboum Z', 'Losonsky G', 'Levine MM']",2003,21,5-6,Vaccine,"Barry EM, et al.

Among serotype 1 isolates, the prevalence of provisional serotype S. flexneri 1c increased from 0 to 56% from 1978 to 2001 in Bangladesh. Detailed biochemical studies revealed that none of the strains of serotype 1 produced indole, while all the strains fermented mannose, mannitol, and trehalose. Twenty percent of the serotype 1c and all the serotype 1a strains fermented maltose and 53% of the serotype 1c strains and 60% of the serotype 1a strains fermented arabinose, whereas all serotype 1b strains were negative for fermentation of these sugars. Only 18% of serotype 1b strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, and most of the serotype 1c and 1b strains were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All the strains of serotypes 1a and 1b and about 88% of the serotype 1c strains were found to be invasive by the Sereny test, had a 140-MDa plasmid, and had Congo red absorption ability. Plasmid profile analysis showed that 26% of the strains of serotype 1 contained identical patterns. Most of the serotype 1c strains (72%) had the 1.6-MDa plasmid, which was not found in either serotype 1a or 1b strains. A self-transmissible middle-range plasmid (35 to 80 MDa) was found in some strains carrying the multiple-antibiotic-resistance gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis yielded three types (types A, B, and C) with numerous subtypes among the serotype 1c strains, whereas serotypes 1b and 1a yielded only one type for each serotype, and those types were related to the types for serotype 1c strains. Ribotyping analysis yielded three patterns for serotype 1c strains and one pattern each for serotype 1a and 1b strains which were similar to the patterns for the serotype 1c strains. Overall analysis of the results concluded that subserotype 1c is closely related to serotypes 1a and 1b. Furthermore, the high rate of prevalence of serotype 1c necessitates the commercial production of antibody against this subserotype to allow the determination of the actual burden of shigellosis caused by provisional serotype 1c.","['Talukder KA', 'Islam Z', 'Islam MA', 'Dutta DK', 'Safa A', 'Ansaruzzaman M', 'Faruque AS', 'Shahed SN', 'Nair GB', 'Sack DA']",2003,41,1,J Clin Microbiol,"Talukder KA, et al.

RESULTS: Concentration of LM and MM substances in patients with AD was much higher compared to healthy subjects in all the examined fluids at the height of the disease. In decline of clinical symptoms the studied concentrations diminished, in early convalescence the substances were at normal levels in red cells and urine being higher in plasm. Maximal changes of the LM and MM substances' concentrations were noted in a severe course of AD.
CONCLUSION: In acute bacterial dysentery concentration of LM and MM substances in blood plasm, red cells and urine depend on the period of the disease course and AD severity.

Treatment is either costly or complicated by the emergence of bacterial resistance. This study compared the efficacy and safety of short course (3 days) and standard course (5 days) oral ciprofloxacin in children with Sd1 dysentery.
METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trial. Children between 1 and 12 years of age with Sd1 dysentery were randomized to receive oral ciprofloxacin suspension 15 mg/kg every 12 h for 3 days followed by placebo for 2 days or ciprofloxacin suspension for 5 days. Treatment success was defined as either resolution of illness or marked improvement on Day 6 of study. Bacteriologic cure was defined as failure to grow Sd1 on a stool sample collected on Day 6. Clinical assessments and joint examinations were performed at baseline, at discharge and 2 weeks later.
RESULTS: Of 253 patients enrolled 128 were assigned to short course ciprofloxacin and 125 to standard course ciprofloxacin. The success rates were 65 and 69% for short and standard course ciprofloxacin, respectively. All patients had bacteriologic cure, and all Sd1 isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. No bacteriologic relapses occurred during the study period. Eight patients reported arthralgia. All patients had normal joint function including at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: In this study twice daily ciprofloxacin for 3 days achieved clinical cure rates similar to those for the same dosage given for 5 days in children with Sd1 dysentery.","['Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, South Africa (Zimbasa) Dysentery Study Group']",2002,21,12,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, South Africa (Zimbasa) Dysentery Study Group.

Invasion plasmid antigen C (IpaC) has been identified as the primary effector protein for Shigella invasion of epithelial cells. Although an initial model of IpaC function has been developed, no detailed structural information is available that could assist in a better understanding of the molecular basis for its interactions with the host cytoskeleton and phospholipid membrane. We have therefore initiated structural studies of IpaC, IpaC I', (residues 101-363 deleted), and IpaC Delta H (residues 63-170 deleted). The secondary and tertiary structure of the protein was examined as a function of temperature, employing circular dichroism and high resolution derivative absorbance techniques. ANS (8-anilino-1-napthalene sulfonic acid) was used to probe the exposure of the hydrophobic surfaces under different conditions. The interaction of IpaC and these mutants with a liposome model (liposomes with entrapped fluorescein) was also examined. Domain III (residues 261-363) was studied using linker-scanning mutagenesis. It was shown that domain III contains periodic, sequence-dependent activity, suggesting helical structure in this section of the protein. In addition to these structural studies, investigation into the actin nucleation properties of IpaC was conducted, and actin nucleation by IpaC and some of the mutants was exhibited. Structure-function relationships of IpaC are discussed.","['Kueltzo LA', 'Osiecki J', 'Barker J', 'Picking WL', 'Ersoy B', 'Picking WD', 'Middaugh CR']",2003,278,5,J Biol Chem,"Kueltzo LA, et al.

12423805,Shigellosis complicating preterm premature rupture of membranes resulting in congenital infection and preterm delivery.,"BACKGROUND: The association of chorioamnionitis with preterm birth is well established. Intra-amniotic infection complicates 13-60% of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) with enteric gram-negative pathogens accounting for 20-40% of recoverable organisms. However, the source of enteric pathogens leading to premature birth has been poorly characterized.
CASE: A 36-year-old multiparous woman presented at 2567 weeks with preterm PROM. She reported a 5-day history of bloody, mucous diarrhea. A fourth cesarean delivery was performed secondary to the onset of labor. Fetal blood, placental membrane, and vaginal pool cultures revealed the presence of Shigella sonnei. With appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 5. Neonatal stool cultures revealed evidence of in utero fetal transmission.
CONCLUSION: It is prudent to treat pregnant patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of shigellosis because this pathogen can result in preterm PROM and preterm delivery. Neonatal testing is indicated if maternal disease is suspected before delivery.","['Rebarber A', 'Star Hampton B', 'Lewis V', 'Bender S']",2002,100,5 Pt 2,Obstet Gynecol,"Rebarber A, et al.

OzFoodNet consists of 7 sites and covers 68 per cent of Australia's population. During 2001, sites reported 15,815 cases of campylobacteriosis, 6,607 cases of salmonellosis, 326 cases of shigellosis, 71 cases of yersiniosis, 61 cases of listeriosis, 47 cases of shiga-toxin producing E. coli and 5 cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Sites reported 86 foodborne outbreaks affecting 1,768 people, of whom 4.0 per cent (70/1,768) were hospitalised and one person died. There was a wide range of foods implicated in these outbreaks and the most common agent was S. Typhimurium. Sites reported two international outbreaks; one of multi-drug resistant S. Typhimurium Definitive Type 104 due to helva imported from Turkey, and one of S. Stanley associated with dried peanuts from China. The National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health conducted a national survey of gastroenteritis. Preliminary data from interviews of 2,417 people suggests that the incidence of foodborne illness is significantly higher than previously thought. OzFoodNet initiated case control studies into risk factors for Campylobacter, Salmonella, Listeria, and shiga-toxin producing E. coli. OzFoodNet developed a foodborne disease outbreak register for Australia; established a network of laboratories to type Campylobacter; prepared a survey of pathology laboratories; reviewed Australian data on listeriosis; and assessed the usefulness of sentinel surveillance for gastroenteritis.

In 1997, the Colombian Instituto Nacional de Salud Microbiology Group organized a network surveillance program with the country's Public Health Laboratories (PHLs) to monitor the principal etiological agents responsible for acute diarrhoeal disease. In May, 2001, the PHL of the state of Cundinamarca reported a food poisoning outbreak involving an elementary school community. The main goal of the Microbiology Group involvement was to establish the molecular relationships among the isolates from the outbreak by phenotypic and genotypic methods of characterization. Stool cultures were obtained from 22 of 195 affected individuals. The Microbiology Group confirmed the identification of the isolates by biochemical and serological probes. The antimicrobial susceptibilities were tested against the following battery of antibiotics: chloramphenicol, trimehoprim-sulfamethozazole, cefotaxime, gentamicin, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin. The isolates were subjected to pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the following CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control) protocols: Xbal restriction enzyme, Shigella sonnei CDC F2353 as the reference standard, and lambda phage as a molecular weight marker. In 15 of 22 (68%) stool cultures Shigella was recovered, all isolates were identified as Shigella flexneri serotype 6 biotype Newcastle with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile. PFGE showed that 3 (20%) isolates were identical (100% genetic similarity) and the other 12 (80%) were very closely related (genetic similarity between 86-98%). The network system permitted the INS ready access to the isolates and the implementation of the PFGE permitted a quantitative characterization of the clonal relationship among the isolates from the outbreak.","['Hidalgo M', 'Realpe ME', 'Muñoz N', 'Sicard D', 'Silva E', 'Agudelo CI', 'Castañeda E']",2002,22,3,Biomedica,"Hidalgo M, et al.

12403099,"Shifting serotypes, plasmid profile analysis and antimicrobial resistance pattern of shigellae strains isolated from Kolkata, India during 1995-2000.","One hundred and sixty-six shigellae strains, isolated from stool samples of paediatric patients (< 5 years old) at a Childrens' Hospital in Kolkata, India during the period of 1995-2000 were examined for serotyping, drug resistance pattern and plasmid profiles. Sh. flexneri (58 %) was found to be commonest isolate of total shigellae, followed by Sh. sonnei (28 %), Sh. boydii (9%) and Sh. dysenteriae (5%). This profile of species was in sharp contrast to the picture obtained before 1995, when Sh. dysenteriae 1 predominated over Sh. flexneri. In Sh. flexneri strains, Sh. flexneri 2a (35%) was the most prevalent serotype, following Sh. flexneri 3a (31%), Sh. flexneri 6 (14%), Sh. flexneri 2b (11%) and Sh. flexneri 4 (9%). Resistance patterns of the strains to 12 commonly used antimicrobial agents and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antibiotics were also tested. All strains were found uniformly susceptible to norfloxacin, but more than 90% strains were resistant to tetracycline, co-trimoxazole and 67% strains were resistant to ampicillin. Resistance to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid was found in 55% (range 45-74%), 46% (range 40-60%) and 29% (range 15-40%) strains respectively. Overall, shigellae strains showed statistically significant increase in resistance against tetracycline, nalidixic acid and furazolidone (P < 0.05) over the years of this study. This indicates decreased efficacy of furazolidone, cotrimoxazole and nalidixic acid for the empirical treatment of shigellosis in Kolkata. Although a few strains showed intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (4%) and cefotaxime (10%) by disk diffusion test, but the MICs of those antibiotics were within the normal limits. Almost 57% of the strains were resistant to four or more drugs with high MICs of the antibiotics. Plasmid profile analysis revealed presence of large plasmid of 220 kb in majority of the strains except in Sh. sonnei and a correlation between presence of smaller plasmids and shigellae serotypes. Hence this study reports epidemiological change of shigellae species in Kolkata, India with regard to serotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns.","['Dutta S', 'Rajendran K', 'Roy S', 'Chatterjee A', 'Dutta P', 'Nair GB', 'Bhattacharya SK', 'Yoshida SI']",2002,129,2,Epidemiol Infect,"Dutta S, et al.

There are 13 translocations and inversions compared with the E.coli sequences, all involve a segment larger than 5 kb, and most are associated with deletions or acquired DNA sequences, of which several are likely to be bacteriophage-transmitted pathogenicity islands. Furthermore, S.flexneri, resembling another human-restricted enteric pathogen, Salmonella typhi, also has hundreds of pseudogenes compared with the E.coli strains.

12361911,Epithelial inflammation response induced by Shigella flexneri depends on mucin gene expression.,"The protective effects of different mucin gene profiles on gut protection were assessed by the evaluation of TNFalpha production by intestinal epithelial cells infected by Shigella flexneri. Three HT-29 cell lines were used: HT29-G(-) (enterocyte-like cells, secreting no mucins), HT29-FU (highly expressing MUC2 and MUC4) and HT29-MTX (highly expressing MUC3 and MUC5AC). These cells were infected either by an invasive (M90T) or the control isogenic (BS176) strains of S. flexneri, and TNFalpha mRNA production was quantified by competitive PCR. In the HT29-G(-) cells, M90T induced an increased production of TNFalpha mRNA compared to BS176, giving a TNFalpha ratio of 5.6 +/- 3.3. In contrast, similar levels of TNFalpha mRNA were detected in HT29-FU and HT29-MTX cells stimulated with either M90T or BS176, giving ratios of 1.4 +/- 1.3 and 1.0 +/- 0.1, respectively. The results suggest that mucin genes have abilities to protect epithelial cells against S. flexneri. Furthermore, the difference in the TNFalpha ratio between the HT29-FU and HT29-MTX cells suggests distinct protective effects for these two mucin-secreting epithelial cells.","['Nutten S', 'Sansonetti P', 'Huet G', 'Bourdon-Bisiaux C', 'Meresse B', 'Colombel JF', 'Desreumaux P']",2002,4,11,Microbes Infect,"Nutten S, et al.

METHODS: Those with symptoms were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire. Cases were defined as having at least three loose stools over a 24 hour period and stool samples requested. A case-control study investigating routes of transmission was performed at the health camp. Environmental investigations of food safety and hygiene were conducted at each facility.
RESULTS: At the camp, 15 (37%) students and 15 (28%) staff met case criteria. Contact with human faeces (OR 4.0; 95% confidence interval 1.0-16.3; p = 0.05) and, for staff, eating camp food (OR 6.9; 1.0-5.0; p = 0.06) were shown to be independent risk factors for illness. At the elderly care facility, four (19%) residents and four (25%) staff met case criteria. Molecular subtyping confirmed that the outbreaks were related to each other and to other cases in travellers returning from Samoa to Auckland and other New Zealand cities over a four month period.

Deciphering the initial molecular events is crucial to understanding the infectious process. We identified a molecular complex involving proteins of both the host, CD44 the hyaluronan receptor, and Shigella, the invasin IpaB, which partitions during infection within specialized membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, called rafts. We also document accumulation of cholesterol and raft-associated proteins at Shigella entry foci. Moreover, we report that Shigella entry is impaired after cholesterol depletion using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Finally, we find that Shigella is less invasive in sphingosid-based lipid-deficient cell lines, demonstrating the involvement of sphingolipids. Our results show that rafts are implicated in Shigella binding and entry, suggesting that raft-associated molecular machineries are engaged in mediating the cell signalling response required for the invasion process.","['Lafont F', 'Tran Van Nhieu G', 'Hanada K', 'Sansonetti P', 'van der Goot FG']",2002,21,17,EMBO J,"Lafont F, et al.

12176849,Bacterial pathogen genomics and vaccines.,"Infectious diseases remain a major cause of deaths and disabilities in the world, the majority of which are caused by bacteria. Although immunisation is the most cost effective and efficient means to control microbial diseases, vaccines are not yet available to prevent many major bacterial infections. Examples include dysentery (shigellosis), gonorrhoea, trachoma, gastric ulcers and cancer (Helicobacter pylori). Improved vaccines are needed to combat some diseases for which current vaccines are inadequate. Tuberculosis, for example, remains rampant throughout most countries in the world and represents a global emergency heightened by the pandemic of HIV. The availability of complete genome sequences has dramatically changed the opportunities for developing novel and improved vaccines and facilitated the efficiency and rapidity of their development. Complete genomic databases provide an inclusive catalogue of all potential candidate vaccines for any bacterial pathogen. In conjunction with adjunct technologies, including bioinformatics, random mutagenesis, microarrays, and proteomics, a systematic and comprehensive approach to identifying vaccine discovery can be undertaken. Genomics must be used in conjunction with population biology to ensure that the vaccine can target all pathogenic strains of a species. A proof in principle of the utility of genomics is provided by the recent exploitation of the complete genome sequence of Neisseria meningitidis group B.","['Moxon R', 'Rappuoli R']",2002,62,,Br Med Bull,Moxon R and Rappuoli R.

It is composed of at least two monomeric IgA molecules, covalently linked through the J chain, and secretory component (SC). We show here that a dimeric/polymeric IgA (IgA(d/p)) is more efficient when bound to SC in protecting mice against bacterial infection of the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that SC ensures, through its carbohydrate residues, the appropriate tissue localization of SIgA by anchoring the antibody to mucus lining the epithelial surface. This in turn impacts the localization and the subsequent clearance of bacteria. Thus, SC is directly involved in the SIgA function in vivo. Therefore, binding of IgA(d/p) to SC during the course of SIgA-mediated mucosal response constitutes a crucial step in achieving efficient protection of the epithelial barrier by immune exclusion.","['Phalipon A', 'Cardona A', 'Kraehenbuhl JP', 'Edelman L', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Corthésy B']",2002,17,1,Immunity,"Phalipon A, et al.

Although, shigellae-contaminated food and drinks are often the source of the epidemic's spread, the possible presence of the pathogen and transmission of it through environmental waters have not been adequately examined. We analyzed surface waters collected in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for the presence of shigellae by a combination of PCR assays followed by concentration and culturing of PCR-positive samples. Analysis of 128 water samples by PCR assays for Shigella-specific virulence genes including ipaBCD, ipaH, and stx1 identified 14 (10.9%) samples which were positive for one or more of these virulence genes. Concentration of the PCR-positive samples by filtration followed by culturing identified live Shigella species in 11 of the 14 PCR-positive samples. Analysis of rRNA gene restriction patterns (ribotype) showed that the environmental isolates shared ribotypes with a collection of clinical isolates, but in contrast to the clinical isolates, 10 of the 11 environmental isolates were either negative or carried deletions in the plasmid-encoded invasion-associated genes ipaB, ipaC, and ipaD. However, all environmental Shigella isolates were positive for the chromosomal multicopy invasion-associated gene ipaH and all Shigella dysenteriae type 1 isolates were positive for the stx1 gene in addition to ipaH. This study demonstrated the presence of Shigella in the aquatic environment and dispersion of different virulence genes among these isolates which appear to constitute an environmental reservoir of Shigella-specific virulence genes.

The lipid A was analyzed underivatized with ESI in negative-ion mode. With multiple stages of fragmentation (MS(n)), both the degree of acylation and the positions of the fatty acids on the disaccharide backbone could be determined. It was possible to determine the degree of acylation by the MS(n) technique, where in each MS stage the parent ion was an ion where one fatty acid had been eliminated. One way to determine the location of the fatty acids was by identifying cross-ring fragments of the reducing sugar from parent ions containing different numbers of fatty acids. Another was by identifying a possible charge-driven release of fatty acids situated close to a phosphate group. The fatty acids were otherwise eliminated by a charge-remote fragmentation mechanism. The combined data show the usefulness of ion-trap mass spectrometers for this type of analysis.","['Kussak A', 'Weintraub A']",2002,307,1,Anal Biochem,Kussak A and Weintraub A.

12120936,Clinical dysentery in hospitalized children.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical dysentery is a severe presentation of an enteric infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a serious bacterial etiology in clinical dysentery in hospitalized children and determine if children at high risk can be identified on the basis of clinical or laboratory parameters.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study design was used. The study population included 60 children admitted to our department with clinical dysentery over a 16-month period. Fresh stool specimens were collected on days 1, 2 and 3. The clinical and laboratory data of the children were analyzed.
RESULTS: Clinical dysentery accounted for 1.7% of all pediatric hospitalizations during this period. Stool cultures were positive for Shigella spp. in 18 children (30%), and Salmonella spp. in 15 children (25%), Campylobacter jejuni was identified in one patient (2%). There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics or laboratory parameters between children with positive and negative stool cultures.
CONCLUSION: 40% of the children hospitalized for clinical dysentery were eligible for antibiotic treatment. Early administration of empiric antibiotic treatment is justified in children hospitalized for clinical dysentery in Israel. Clinical or laboratory parameters were unable to differentiate those with clinical dysentery at risk of serous bacterial pathogens in stool.","['Finkelstein Y', 'Moran O', 'Avitzur Y', 'Nussinovitch M', 'Harel L', 'Volovitz B', 'Amir J']",2002,30,3,Infection,"Finkelstein Y, et al.

24643271,[Not Available].,"Foodborne infections are the leading cause of health problems during and after travel to areas of low hygienic standards. The majority of cases are traveler's diarrhea. However, some foodborne infections can cause severe or chronic enteritis (e.g. shigellosis, typhoid fever, amebic dysentery, helminth infections), or diseases of other organ systems (e.g. hepatitis A, poliomyelitis, tissue parasitoses). The etiology of traveler's diarrhea is heterogeneous. Most common are bacteria, notably enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and rotavirus. New diagnostic methods (PCR, coproantigen-ELISA) increase the diagnostic sensitivity and spectrum considerably. Microbiological diagnosis is indicated in severe or chronic enteritis, and in the immunocompromized. However, to apply the complete spectrum of available methods is economically and medically not justified, and the diagnostic work-up has to be done in a step-wise manner. Antibiotics like ciprofloxacin are effective in treatment and prevention of traveler's diarrhea. However, the empiric use of antibiotics should be restricted to the treatment of dysenteric and febrile cases of enteritis. New antisecretory drugs, nonabsorbable antibiotics, and new vaccines against cholera, ETEC and rotavirus are under clinical development.","['Löscher T', 'Hoelscher M']",2002,45,7,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,Löscher T and Hoelscher M.

The atypical strains agglutinated only with the type antigen factor 4 and did not agglutinate with any group factors, thereby excluding their characterization into serotype 4a or 4b. Of the 21 strains, 85.7% did not ferment mannitol but were able to ferment most of the sugars, whereas the remaining 14.3% strains fermented mannitol but were unable to ferment most of the sugars. Most of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole. All of the strains harbored the 140-MDa plasmid, had the ipaH gene, had the sen gene (encoding Shigella enterotoxin 2), had the ability to bind Congo red, and were positive for keratoconjunctivitis in the guinea pig eye, attesting their invasive properties. All of the strains contained a middle-range plasmid (35 to 62 MDa) as well as a number of stable small plasmids, yielding mainly two plasmid profiles which were different from those of 4a and 4b strains. Conjugation and curing experiments suggested that the middle-range plasmids harbored a self-transferable multiple antibiotic resistance marker. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of all of the tested strains yielded two types with numerous subtypes, whereas ribotyping yielded only two types which were completely different from those of types 4a and 4b.

12065527,Human monocytes kill Shigella flexneri but then die by apoptosis associated with suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production.,"Shigella flexneri infection of human macrophages is followed by rapid bacterial escape into the cytosol and secretion of IpaB, which activates caspase-1 to mediate cell death and release of mature interleukin (IL)-1 beta. Here we report a different outcome following infection of human peripheral blood monocytes. S. flexneri infects monocytes inefficiently in the absence of complement and, following complement-dependent uptake, cannot escape the endosomal compartment. Consequently, bacteria are killed within the first 60 min in the absence of monocyte cell death, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy and enumeration of colonies in a gentamicin protection assay. Despite early bacterial death, wild-type S. flexneri influenced the subsequent monocyte proinflammatory cytokine response and cell fate. Infection with wild-type S. flexneri resulted in IpaB-dependent suppression of IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-6 compared with that of plasmid-cured avirulent S. flexneri-infected cells. Furthermore, over the following 6 to 8 h, virulent S. flexneri-infected monocytes died by apoptosis whereas avirulent infected monocytes died by necrosis. Together, these results imply that monocytes migrating into the inflammatory site during the early stages of shigellosis kill S. flexneri but that during bacterial uptake, they receive virulence signals from S. flexneri which induce delayed apoptosis associated with suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine response to bacterial phagocytosis. This delayed apoptosis may have important effects on the ordered initiation of the innate immune response, leading to the excessive inflammatory response characteristic of shigellosis.","['Hathaway LJ', 'Griffin GE', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Edgeworth JD']",2002,70,7,Infect Immun,"Hathaway LJ, et al.

12018205,Neutrophil elastase targets virulence factors of enterobacteria.,"Shigellae cause bacillary dysentery, a bloody form of diarrhoea that affects almost 200 million people and causes nearly 2 million deaths per year. Shigella invades the colonic mucosa, where it initiates an acute inflammation, rich in neutrophils, that initially contributes to tissue damage and eventually resolves the infection. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells that kill microorganisms but it is unclear how neutrophils control pathogenic bacteria expressing virulence factors that manipulate host cells. In contrast to other cells, neutrophils prevent the escape of Shigella from phagocytic vacuoles in which the bacteria are killed. Here we identify human neutrophil elastase (NE) as a key host defence protein: NE degrades Shigella virulence factors at a 1,000-fold lower concentration than that needed to degrade other bacterial proteins. In neutrophils in which NE is inactivated pharmacologically or genetically, Shigella escapes from phagosomes, increasing bacterial survival. NE also preferentially cleaves virulence factors of Salmonella and Yersinia. These findings establish NE as the first neutrophil factor that targets bacterial virulence proteins.","['Weinrauch Y', 'Drujan D', 'Shapiro SD', 'Weiss J', 'Zychlinsky A']",2002,417,6884,Nature,"Weinrauch Y, et al.

Death from shigellosis is rare in Fiji. However, the global problem of emerging multidrug resistance raises some issues about the management of Shigellosis in this country.

There was only one recorded death during this time--in 1998. Resistance to chloramphenicol occurred in 82% of cases. Shigella flexneri in Fiji remains sensitive to cephalothin and cefaclor. The current antibiotic guidelines in Fiji, recommend that antibiotics be used only for cases of moderate and severe dysentery. Shigellosis was suspected soon after presentation however the patient was unable to take oral antibiotics and was treated with intravenous antibiotics (chloramphenicol and ampicillin), which were ineffective due to resistance of the organism. The current antibiotic guidelines for severe dysentery recommend chloramphenicol or nalidixic acid--the later not available in Fiji. However the only intravenous drugs that retain their sensitivity to Shigella-ceftriaxone and cephalothin, are expensive ($F 45.00 per vial of ceftriaxone) and these are only available in large regional hospitals.",['Watson C'],2001,8,1,Pac Health Dialog,Watson C.

Expression of proteins and cytokines participating in the apoptotic process (caspase-1, caspase-3, Fas [CD95], Fas ligand [Fas-L], perforin, granzyme A, Bax, WAF-1, Bcl-2, interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-18, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) in tissue in the acute and convalescent stages of dysentery was quantified at the single-cell level by in situ immunostaining. Apoptotic cell death in the lamina propria was markedly up-regulated at the acute stage (P < 0.05), where an increased number of necrotic cells were also seen. Phenotypic analysis of apoptotic cells revealed that 43% of T cells (CD3), 10% of granulocytes (CD15), and 5% of macrophages (CD56) underwent apoptosis. Increased activity of caspase-1 persisted in the rectum up to 1 month after onset. More-extensive expression of Fas, Fas-L, perforin, caspase-3, and IL-18, but not IL-2, at the acute stage than at the convalescent stage was observed. Increased expression of caspase-3 and IL-18 in tissues with severe inflammation compared to expression in those with mild inflammation was evident, implying a possible role in the perpetuation of inflammation. Significantly reduced cell death during convalescence was associated with a significant up-regulation of Bcl-2, Bax, and WAF-1 expression in the rectum compared to that in the acute phase of infection. Thus, induction of apoptosis at the local site in the early phase of S. dysenteriae type 1 infection was associated with a significant up-regulation of Fas/Fas-L and perforin and granzyme A expression and a down-regulation of Bcl-2 and IL-2, which promote cell survival.","['Raqib R', 'Ekberg C', 'Sharkar P', 'Bardhan PK', 'Zychlinsky A', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Andersson J']",2002,70,6,Infect Immun,"Raqib R, et al.

The following is a brief review of the way in which TTSSs and their effectors contribute to the pathogenic nature of the prototypic diarrheal pathogens Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC).","['Zaharik ML', 'Gruenheid S', 'Perrin AJ', 'Finlay BB']",2002,291,8,Int J Med Microbiol,"Zaharik ML, et al.

12002106,Antibiotic resistance and sero-groups of shigella among paediatric out-patients in southwest Ethiopia.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Shigella sero-groups and resistance pattern of isolates to commonly used antibiotics in Jimma.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: The study was conducted in Jimma, southwest Ethiopia.
SUBJECTS: A total of 384 paediatric out-patients with diarrhoea aged 14 years and below were studied.
METHODS: Stool specimens were collected from children presenting with diarrhoea using Cary-Blair transport medium and buffer treated swabs from Jimma hospital and Jimma health centre. Isolation, biochemical characterisation, sero-grouping and antibiotic sensitivity testing were performed according to standard methodology in the Microbiology laboratory of Jimma University.
RESULTS: Out of the 77 Shigella strains isolated, sero-group A comprised 29.9%, B 40.3%, C 19.5% and D 10.4%. Among all Shigella sero-groups, highest resistance was encountered to tetracycline (63.6%), ampicillin (70.1%), cephalothin (57.1%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (32.5%) and chloramphenicol (40.3%) whileleast resistance was observed to gentamicin (1.3%), polymyxin B (3.9%) and nalidixic acid (6.5%).

12000622,Quantitative assessment of risk reduction from hand washing with antibacterial soaps.,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have estimated that there are 3,713,000 cases of infectious disease associated with day care facilities each year. The objective of this study was to examine the risk reduction achieved from using different soap formulations after diaper changing using a microbial quantitative risk assessment approach. To achieve this, a probability of infection model and an exposure assessment based on micro-organism transfer were used to evaluate the efficacy of different soap formulations in reducing the probability of disease following hand contact with an enteric pathogen. Based on this model, it was determined that the probability of infection ranged from 24/100 to 91/100 for those changing diapers of babies with symptomatic shigellosis who used a control product (soap without an antibacterial ingredient), 22/100 to 91/100 for those who used an antibacterial soap (chlorohexadine 4%), and 15/100 to 90/100 for those who used a triclosan (1.5%) antibacterial soap. Those with asymptomatic shigellosis who used a non-antibacterial control soap had a risk between 49/100,000 and 53/100, those who used the 4% chlorohexadine-containing soap had a risk between 43/100,000 and 51/100, and for those who used a 1.5% triclosan soap had a risk between 21/100,000 and 43/100. The adequate washing of hands after diapering reduces risk and can be further reduced by a factor of 20% by the use of an antibacterial soap. Quantitative risk assessment is a valuable tool in the evaluation of household sanitizing agents and low risk outcomes.","['Gibson LL', 'Rose JB', 'Haas CN', 'Gerba CP', 'Rusin PA']",2002,92 Suppl,,J Appl Microbiol,"Gibson LL, et al.

11994481,Two msbB genes encoding maximal acylation of lipid A are required for invasive Shigella flexneri to mediate inflammatory rupture and destruction of the intestinal epithelium.,"Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative pathogen that invades and causes inflammatory destruction of the human colonic epithelium, thus leading to bloody diarrhea and dysentery. A type III secretion system that delivers effector proteins into target eukaryotic cells is largely responsible for cell and tissue invasion. However, the respective role of this invasive phenotype and of lipid A, the endotoxin of the Shigella LPS, in eliciting the inflammatory cascade that leads to rupture and destruction of the epithelial barrier, was unknown. We investigated whether genetic detoxification of lipid A would cause significant alteration in pathogenicity. We showed that S. flexneri has two functional msbB genes, one carried by the chromosome (msbB1) and the other by the virulence plasmid (msbB2), the products of which act in complement to produce full acyl-oxy-acylation of the myristate at the 3' position of the lipid A glucosamine disaccharide. A mutant in which both the msbB1 and msbB2 genes have been inactivated was impaired in its capacity to cause TNF-alpha production by human monocytes and to cause rupture and inflammatory destruction of the epithelial barrier in the rabbit ligated intestinal loop model of shigellosis, indicating that lipid A plays a significant role in aggravating inflammation that eventually destroys the intestinal barrier. In addition, neutralization of TNF-alpha during invasion by the wild-type strain strongly impaired its ability to cause rupture and inflammatory destruction of the epithelial lining, thus indicating that TNF-alpha is a major effector of epithelial destruction by Shigella.","[""D'Hauteville H"", 'Khan S', 'Maskell DJ', 'Kussak A', 'Weintraub A', 'Mathison J', 'Ulevitch RJ', 'Wuscher N', 'Parsot C', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2002,168,10,J Immunol,"D'Hauteville H, et al.

11981835,Cytotoxicity and interleukin-1beta processing following Shigella flexneri infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.,"Shigella flexneri infection of macrophages (MPhi) leads to activation of caspase-1 by the IpaB virulence factor, which induces rapid cell death and release of mature IL-1beta. Here we show that S. flexneri infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) also results in rapid IpaB-dependent death. Cytotoxicity is only partially blocked by the caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD, but completely blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD. Cytotoxicity is also partially blocked by glycine without affecting caspase-1-dependent IL-1beta processing, and treatment with glycine and YVAD completely blocks cytotoxicity, implying that glycine inhibits a caspase-1-independent cytotoxic mechanism. S. flexneri infection of LPS-pre-treated DC and Mphi results in comparable release of mature IL-1beta, although DC release significantly less IL-18 than MPhi. IL-1beta release from infected DC occurs within 3 h of the initial LPS pre-stimulation signal, implying that infection of DC will contribute towards induction of the early inflammatory response. The rapid death of DC during the early stages of shigellosis is likely to have adverse consequences for generation of adaptive immunity.","['Edgeworth JD', 'Spencer J', 'Phalipon A', 'Griffin GE', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2002,32,5,Eur J Immunol,"Edgeworth JD, et al.

11967124,Delayed and reduced adaptive humoral immune responses in children with shigellosis compared with in adults.,"We hypothesized that increased susceptibility to Shigella infection, increased severity of disease and high mortality in children compared with adults were consequences of insufficient adaptive immune responses. Antigen-specific immune responses were studied in paediatric patients (n = 38, 2-10 years) with shigellosis and compared with those of adult patients (n = 30, 18-45 years). Peak frequencies of antigen (invasion plasmid coded antigen B, Ipa-B; lipopolysaccharide, LPS)-specific immunoglobulin (IgM)-antibody secreting cells (ASC) were seen within 3-5 days after the onset of diarrhoea in children, while peak IgA- and IgG-ASCs were obtained 8-10 days later in line with adults. Antigen-specific ASC responses in children ranged between 2 and 4% of the total ASC responses, in contrast to 8-15% in adults. The kinetics of LPS-specific IgG subclass titres was different in younger children (2.5-5 years) (IgG1 > IgG2 > IgG4 > IgG3) compared with in older children (6-8 years) (IgG2 > IgG1 >IgG3 > IgG4) and adults. Secretory IgA levels in stool peaked 8-10 days after onset in both adults and children. However, a rapid induction of stool LPS-specific IgA, IgA1 and IgA2 occurred in adult patients within 3-5 days of onset, while in children, this was delayed by 8-10 days. Similarly, higher number of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma expressing cells in vitro were seen in adult patients in response to antigens (LPS and Ipa-B) in the acute stage in contrast to paediatric patients. Thus, paediatric patients with shigellosis have reduced and delayed adaptive immune responses compared with adult patients.","['Raqib R', 'Qadri F', 'SarkEr P', 'Mia SM', 'Sansonnetti PJ', 'Albert MJ', 'Andersson J']",2002,55,4,Scand J Immunol,"Raqib R, et al.

More than 200 people were affected. Epidemiological investigations implicated a regionally manufactured fresh pasteurised milk cheese as the vehicle of infection. A case-control study showed a statistically significant association between the illness and consumption of the suspect cheese. The dispersed sale of the cheese resulted in a regional dissemination of the organism and people were affected in eight townships. Research suggested that an infected foodhandler at the cheese factory might have been the source of contamination and that the processing method might have allowed cross-contamination to occur. This study emphasises the importance of increasing the control of strict hygiene during the processing of fresh cheese, since legislation does not forbid direct contact by hand that could result in contamination of cheese even when the milk pasteurisation process was correctly performed.","['Garcia-Fulgueiras A', 'Sánchez S', 'Guillén JJ', 'Marsilla B', 'Aladueña A', 'Navarro C']",2001,17,6,Eur J Epidemiol,"Garcia-Fulgueiras A, et al.

11924776,Effects of buprenorphine on immunogenicity and protective efficacy in the guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis model (Sereny test).,"Shigellosis is a disease of global proportions, with an estimated 164.7 million episodes annually throughout the world as well as an estimated 1.1 million associated mortalities in developing countries. Due to increasing incidence, and continued emergence of multi-drug resistant strains, Shigella vaccine development is considered a top public health priority. The guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis model, the basis for the Sereny test, remains the most reliable in vivo indicator of virulence of Shigella strains and immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Shigella vaccine candidates. The model is effective in evaluating the ability of Shigella strains to invade the corneal epithelia of guinea pigs and spread to contiguous cells, with the more virulent strains causing ulcerative keratoconjunctivitis. However, analgesia is not routinely used to relieve this painful condition because of potential immunomodulation and confounding of experimental results. The objective of the study reported here was to evaluate use of buprenorphine hydrochloride as an analgesic during the Sereny test. Local and systemic immune responses were measured in guinea pigs given buprenorphine versus those responses in controls. Results of this study suggest that buprenorphine, administered at an analgesic dose of 0.05 mg/kg of body weight twice daily, can be successfully used with the model without significantly affecting immunologic evaluation of Shigella vaccine candidates. However, in buprenorphine-treated animals, there was a significant increase in the amount of mucopurulent ocular discharge, requiring frequent cleaning of the affected eyes. Additionally, animals treated with buprenorphine had significant reduction in body weight, in comparison with saline controls.","['Hanson CE', 'Ruble GR', 'Essiet I', 'Hartman AB']",2001,51,3,Comp Med,"Hanson CE, et al.

The incidence for viral hemorrhagic fever was estimated 0.0018 under assumption that ""it correlates with the malaria incidence from Africa"" and that ""the incidence occurs every 15 years"". These results indicate little possibility of remarkable increase of exotic infections during the event. These incidences, however, may occur in the rural prefectures where few cases are reported.

Covering 30 villages, with a population of about 30,000 inhabitants, the area has been under demographic and epidemiological surveillance. In 1999, the surveillance allowed 973 cases of shigellosis to be recorded out of 1,751 cases of dysenteric diarrhoeas. The outbreak reached a peak during the raining season (73% of the cases in September and October). All the villages and all age groups were concerned. The attack rate in the population was 3%. During the same period, 22 deaths were attributed to shigellosis, leading to a lethality of 2.3%. Children under five were the most affected. The bacteriological examination isolated S. flexneri in 72% of 12 stools samples and S. dysenteriae A1 (SD1) in 14%. All serotypes were resistant to ampicillin and susceptible to quinolones. Susceptibility to cotrimoxazole was unconstant. Apart from the usual factors involved in the spread of diarrhoeas, the main reason evoked to explain the duration of the epidemic has been the lack of adequate emergency antibiotherapy treatment. Quinolones, recommended by the health authorities, could not be provided by health services. The identification of the SD1 serotype confirmed its involvement in the outbreak of shigellosis.

In this study, three Nigerian medicinal plants: Ocimum gratissimum, Terminalia avicennoides, and Momordica balsamina were investigated for their activities against multidrug-resistant Shigella species isolated from patients with bacilliary dysentery in Lagos. Decoctions of O. gratissimum and concoctions of O. gratissimum and T. avicennoides at crude concentration of 3,000 micrograms/mL markedly inhibited the growth of all isolates tested. Zones of inhibition indicating susceptibilities of the organisms varied from 18.3 to 21.5 mm for Shigella dysenteriae, 15.3 to 16.3 mm for S. flexneri, 18.8 to 19.3 mm for S. sonnei, and 16.5 mm for S. boydii. Except S. flexneri, minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration revealed a higher shigellocidal property of O. gratissimum/T. avicennoides concoction than other extracts in S. dysenteriae (300-515.6 vs 337.5-1,312.5 micrograms/mL), S. sonnei (309.4-543.8 vs 403.1-1,312.5 micrograms/mL), and S. boydii (243.8-337.5 vs 253-1,312.5 micrograms/mL).

11853332,Sodium and water homeostasis in children with shigellosis.,"UNLABELLED: Studies in Bangladesh have shown that the mortality in shigellosis is significantly higher in hyponatraemic (HN) than in normo- (NN) or hypernatraemic children. The aim of this study was to describe the effect of shigellosis on renal haemodynamics and sodium and water homeostasis before treatment was started. Twenty-one moderately ill children infected with Shigella dysenteriae type I were studied. Eight of them had a serum sodium concentration below 130 mmol/L. Renal function was determined by glomerular filtration rate measured by clearances of inulin and iohexol. Effective renal plasma flow was estimated by clearance of para-aminohippuric acid. Plasma renin, aldosterone and anti-diuretic hormone were also studied. The HN children had significantly higher haemoglobin and haematocrit levels than the NN group. There was an inverse correlation between serum sodium and haemoglobin, and a direct correlation between serum sodium and urinary sodium and urinary chloride. Direct correlations were found between serum aldosterone and haemoglobin, plasma renin and systolic blood pressure and an inverse correlation between serum aldosterone and serum sodium. Clearances of inulin and iohexol were normal. Detectable levels of ADH were found in both groups, despite low serum osmolalities.
CONCLUSION: The HN state seems to be triggered by multiple factors. The normal glomerular filtration rate excludes a volume expansion secondary to reduced renal function. Inappropriate or a physiological increase of anti-diuretic hormone secretion may be of importance. The higher sodium losses in stools of the HN children might also be a factor contributing to the HN.","['Lindblad H', 'Berg U', 'Dhar U', 'Mahalanabis D', 'Salaam MA', 'Zetterström R']",2001,90,12,Acta Paediatr,"Lindblad H, et al.

11845469,"Differentiation of Shigella strains by plasmid profile analysis, serotyping and phage typing.","Ninety-one Shigella flexneri and 29 Shigella sonnei strains isolated during 1994 from sporadic cases of shigellosis and healthy carriers were analyzed for plasmid profile in order to compare the discriminating ability of this method with that of serotyping and phage typing. Our study revealed 10 plasmid profiles (PP) among S. sonnei strains. A total of 26 out of 29 (89%) S. sonnei isolates could be placed into two phage types (type 1 and 20) comprising four PP for phage type 1 and seven PP for type 20, respectively. Twenty-three different PP were identified among S. flexneri strains. Each serotype was associated with a specific predominant plasmid profile, except serotype 2a. This serotype, the most frequently isolated in Romania, was still rather homogeneous: 33 out of 39 isolates belonged to phage type 125, 27 of which could be placed into two related PP (F10 and F17). Comparison of plasmid patterns of epidemiologically independent S. flexneri serotype 2a isolates with those exhibited by 45 serotype 2a isolates associated to six independent outbreaks revealed the same homogeneity. Thirty-eight strains, representing 4 of 6 outbreaks, had F10 and F17 plasmid patterns. The discrimination indices (D) for plasmid profile analysis alone (D = 0.890) and for the combination of serotyping and phage typing (D = 0.841) indicate that both typing systems have a nearly similar ability of discriminating among S. flexneri strains. By combining the results of the three typing methods, a total of 42 types are distinguished and the D value is 0.942. Our data suggest that plasmid profile analysis can complement phenotyping methods resulting in a degree of discrimination that cannot be achieved by either system alone.","['Surdeanu M', 'Pencu E', 'Tonciu M', 'Mihai I', 'Ciudin L']",2000,59,1-2,Roum Arch Microbiol Immunol,"Surdeanu M, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A chemiluminescent response of peripheral blood neutrophils was studied in patients with acute mild and moderate dysentery in the presence of luminol. Lipopolysaccharide Salmonella typhimurium at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml served as a priming substance of S-chemotype. Neutrophils were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate in concentration 10(-6) M and isolated on Histopaque double gradient (Sigma reagents, USA).
RESULTS: In reproduction of priming-phenomenon in vitro on neutrophils of patients with acute Flexner's dysentery chemiluminescence amplitude increased 1.29-1.69-fold vs control.
CONCLUSION: Priming-phenomenon on neutrophils in acute dysentery is reproducible. This confirms modulating properties of lipopolysaccharides in conditions of systemic nonphysiological endotoxinemia.

METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) domestic fleroxacin and lomefloxacin were determined by agar disk dilution method and microplate method respectively. A clinical observation of fleroxacin and lomefloxacin for treating acute bacillary dysentery was carried out.
RESULTS: MIC(90) of fleroxacin against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. dysenteriae, S. aureus was 0.25-2 mg/L, being the same as that of ofloxacin. However, MIC(90) of lomefloxacin against the above mentioned species was twice or fourfold as that of ofloxacin and fleroxacin.

11787716,Protective role of human lactoferrin against invasion of Shigella flexneri M90T.,"Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein found in human mucosal secretions such as milk. A variety of functions have been ascribed to this protein, it appears to contribute to antimicrobial host defense. Still its overall physiological role remains to be defined. We sought to study the role of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLf) in Shigella infection. Invasion of epithelial cells is essential to the development of bacillary dysentery. Shigella flexneri 5 M90T, a virulent strain, was evaluated in the classic HeLa cell invasion model, in immunoblots, and by transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and deconvolved microscopy Bacteria not exposed to rhLf were used as controls. We found that rhLf decreased significantly the invasiveness of S. flexneri 5 M90T in a HeLa cell model. The immunoblot data showed that invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB) was released from the bacteria during incubation with rhLf. Lactoferrin treatment did not directly dissociate the complex of IpaB and IpaC (IpaBC) once the complex had been formed. Furthermore, ferric iron had no effect on release of IpaB. Electron microscopy of rhLf-treated bacteria suggested a reduction in vacuolization of the HeLa cell cytoplasm and decreased number of bacteria within HeLa cells. At 40,000 x magnification the few rhLf-treated Shigella that invaded exhibited a dense ring completely surrounding them. Immunofluorescence and deconvolved microscopy suggested that rhLf-treated bacteria were completely surrounded by a thick layer of actin. The fact that two cell surface functions (invasion and actin-mediated movement) were deranged suggests that rhLf disrupts the integrity of the bacterial outer membrane in which virulence proteins are anchored. The mechanism by which rhLf impairs Shigella invasiveness may be relevant to other enteropathogens that share similar virulence strategies.","['Gomez HF', 'Herrera-Insua I', 'Siddiqui MM', 'Diaz-Gonzalez VA', 'Caceres E', 'Newburg DS', 'Cleary TG']",2001,501,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Gomez HF, et al.

For one year, we studied 95 strains of Shigella obtained from stool specimens of patients with dysentery. Bacteria came from various health care centres in the states of Chaco and Corrientes (Argentina). Bacteria were identified by using classical biochemical methods. All strains were serotyped and susceptibility patterns were determined using thirteen antibiotics. Bacteriocin typing was determined by the sensitivity to piocins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to marcescins of Serratia marcescens. Colicin production in S. sonnei was also studied. Among all the strains examined, the most prevalent was Shigella flexneri (82%) followed by Shigella sonnei (18%). The most frequent serotype among S. flexneri was 2 (93%), followed by serotypes 6 (4%), 1 (1.5%), and 3 (1.5%). S. sonnei strains were classified in 7 antibiotypes, 6 piocin types, 3 marcescin types, and 4 colicin types. Strains of S. flexneri type 2 were divided among 14 antibiotypes, 4 piocin types and 2 marcescin types. Simpson's index of diversity was applied to evaluate the discriminatory power of studied typing methods, both alone and combined.

Four hundred fifty-nine isolates were identified as shigellae (62) and E. coli (397). Shigella flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, and S. sonnei accounted, respectively, for 51.6%, 17.7%, 17.7%, and 13% of the total number of shigellae isolated. Eleven cases of shigellosis occurred in the age group of 0-9 years, 22 cases in the age group of 10-19 years, and 29 cases in the age group of > or = 20 years. Of the 397 E. coli isolates, 11 were enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and 7 of these strains were isolated with shigellae from stools of patients aged 0-9 year(s) (71.4%) and 10-19 years (28.6%). Over 70% of the Shigella isolates were resistant to two or more drugs, including ampicillin and tetracycline. Twenty-one distinct multidrug resistance patterns were observed in these isolates. During 1990-2000, resistance to ampicillin increased from 70% to 90%, co-trimoxazole from 77% to 85%, chloramphenicol from 71% to 77%, streptomycin from 71% to 79%, and nalidixic acid from 0% to 11.3%. Resistance to tetracycline decreased from 89% to 79% but with MIC50 and MIC90 values outside the susceptible range. While resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin remained nil with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.008 and 0.0016 microgram/mL respectively. The results of this study revealed the endemicity of shigellosis with S. flexneri as the predominant serogroup in Lagos. Children and young adults were at a higher risk of severe shigellosis. The results also suggest that ampicillin, tetracycline, co-trimoxazole, and streptomycin should not be used as the first-line drugs in the treatment of shigellosis. Nalidixic acid should still be selectively used for treatment, while ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin can be ideal alternatives.","['Iwalokun BA', 'Gbenle GO', 'Smith SI', 'Ogunledun A', 'Akinsinde KA', 'Omonigbehin EA']",2001,19,3,J Health Popul Nutr,"Iwalokun BA, et al.

The anti-CD14-treated rabbits exhibited more severe tissue destruction and a 50-fold increase in bacterial invasion of the intestinal mucosa when compared to controls. Similar numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were recruited to the intestinal mucosa in both groups despite the massive bacterial invasion seen in the CD14-blocked group. No statistically significant differences were seen in levels of IL-1beta nor in the ratio of IL-1RA/IL-1beta for either group. In contrast, higher quantities of TNF-alpha were observed in the CD14-blocked group.

11705937,Characterization of a Shiga toxin-encoding temperate bacteriophage of Shigella sonnei.,"A Shiga toxin (Stx)-encoding temperate bacteriophage of Shigella sonnei strain CB7888 was investigated for its morphology, DNA similarity, host range, and lysogenization in Shigella and Escherichia coli strains. Phage 7888 formed plaques on a broad spectrum of Shigella strains belonging to different species and serotypes, including Stx-producing Shigella dysenteriae type 1. With E. coli, only strains with rough lipopolysaccharide were sensitive to this phage. The phage integrated into the genome of nontoxigenic S. sonnei and laboratory E. coli K-12 strains, which became Stx positive upon lysogenization. Moreover, phage 7888 is capable of transducing chromosomal genes in E. coli K-12. The relationships of phage 7888 with the E. coli Stx1-producing phage H-19B and the E. coli Stx2-producing phage 933W were investigated by DNA cross-hybridization of phage genomes and by nucleotide sequencing of an 8,053-bp DNA region of the phage 7888 genome flanking the stx genes. By these methods, a high similarity was found between phages 7888 and 933W. Much less similarity was found between phages H-19B and 7888. As in the other Stx phages, a regulatory region involved in Q-dependent expression is found upstream of stxA and stxB (stx gene) in phage 7888. The morphology of phage 7888 was similar to that of phage 933W, which shows a hexagonal head and a short tail.

11680789,Exploitation of host factors for efficient infection by Shigella.,"Shigellosis is a worldwide endemic ulcerating disease of the large intestine caused by enteroinvasive bacteria. Shigella takes the route via M-cells and macrophages to access the basolateral pole of enterocytes. After invasion of and cell-to-cell spread within the epithelial cell layer, the bacterium multiplies within the cytoplasm of enterocytes. Induced by a limited number of bacterial effector proteins, Shigella makes use of established signaling pathways of the host cell to achieve internalization, transcytosis, apoptosis or cell-to-cell spread.

This raises the question of what species concept to apply to bacteria. We suggest that the species definition in bacteria should be based on analysis of sequence variation in housekeeping genes, and also that the ""clone"" be given official status in bacterial nomenclature.

11517436,Cadaverine prevents the escape of Shigella flexneri from the phagolysosome: a connection between bacterial dissemination and neutrophil transepithelial signaling.,"Shigella flexneri causes bacillary dysentery in humans by invading epithelial cells of the colon, which is characterized by an acute polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL)-rich inflammation. Our recent studies demonstrated that cadaverine, a polyamine, specifically acts to abrogate transepithelial signaling to PMNL induced by S. flexneri. Here, insight is provided into the cellular mechanisms by which cadaverine attenuates the ability of Shigella species to induce PMNL signaling. It was found that cadaverine retards the lysis of the Shigella species-containing vacuole, suggesting that a blockade is established, in which the pathogen is prevented from adequately interacting with the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, an IcsA mutant of S. flexneri that cannot interact with the cytoskeleton and spreads intercellularly fails to induce transmigration of PMNL. Results indicate that cadaverine-induced compartmentalization of Shigella species to the phagolysosome might be a protective response of the host that directly contributes to the diminished ability of PMNL to transmigrate across model intestinal epithelia.","['Fernandez IM', 'Silva M', 'Schuch R', 'Walker WA', 'Siber AM', 'Maurelli AT', 'McCormick BA']",2001,184,6,J Infect Dis,"Fernandez IM, et al.

In this study, we identified dksA as a gene necessary for intercellular spread in, but not invasion of, cultured cells. The S. flexneri dksA mutant exhibited sensitivity to acid and oxidative stress, in part due to an effect of DksA on production of RpoS. However, an S. flexneri rpoS mutant formed plaques on tissue culture monolayers, thus excluding DksA regulation of RpoS as the mechanism responsible for the inability of the dksA mutant to spread intercellularly. Intracellular analysis of the dksA mutant indicates that it survived and divided within the Henle cell cytoplasm, but the dksA mutant cells were elongated, and some exhibited filamentation in the intracellular environment. Some of the S. flexneri dksA mutant cells showed aberrant localization of virulence protein IcsA, which may inhibit spread between epithelial cells.","['Mogull SA', 'Runyen-Janecky LJ', 'Hong M', 'Payne SM']",2001,69,9,Infect Immun,"Mogull SA, et al. dksA is required for intercellular spread of Shigella flexneri via an RpoS-independent mechanism. dksA is required for intercellular spread of Shigella flexneri via an RpoS-independent mechanism. 2001; 69:5742-51. doi: 10.1128/IAI.69.9.5742-5751.2001",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11500451/

Analytical sensitivity (2 x 10(2) cfu) of the PCR technique was obtained by artificially spiking negative stool samples with a standard strain of S. flexneri type 2, then determining the detection limit. Specificity (100%) of the method was determined by testing a number of known Shigella and EIEC strains and organisms other than Shigella spp. A total of 300 stool samples collected from children with acute diarrhoea was plated on to two selective agar media after enrichment in Luria broth. Shigella spp. were isolated from 7.7% (23 of 300) and EIEC from 1% (3 of 300) patients. All enriched stool samples were subjected to PCR to amplify the target sequence of invasive plasmid antigen (ipa)H locus, a multicopy element found on the chromosome and invasion plasmid. The stool PCR was positive in 24 of the 26 culture-positive and in 22 culture-negative stools, thus detecting the presence of Shigella spp. or EIEC in 15.3% (46 of 300) of diarrhoea cases. When an ial probe was used for colony hybridistion with enriched stool cultures blotted on to membranes, 9.6% (29 of 300) of dysentery cases were identified as being caused by Shigella spp. or EIEC. Thus the sensitivity of enriched stool culture, colony hybridisation and enriched stool PCR was found to be 54%, 60% and 96%, respectively, when each of the methods was compared to the total microbiologically confirmed cases of dysentery. It was also observed that only 38% (48 of 126) of acute bloody dysentery cases actually had shigella or EIEC infection, as confirmed by laboratory methods.

DESIGN: A descriptive, case-control study.
SETTING: An international sports event in Johannesburg.
METHODS: A questionnaire survey of involved children was used to conduct a case-control study. Microbiological and chemical analysis of the implicated food was undertaken. Site visits to the premises involved in food preparation were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 578 children were involved. Of the 361 children who returned questionnaires, 134 were affected by an acute-onset emetic-type illness, while 53 children developed diarrhoea. Consumption of fruit juice was associated with acute illness, while diarrhoea was associated with the consumption of maize-meal porridge (pap) and chicken stew. Microbiological analysis revealed high bacterial loads in samples of the fruit juice and the presence of Shigella flexneri in the maize-meal porridge. Visits to the suppliers of the implicated foods revealed several deficiencies in terms of food hygiene precautions.
CONCLUSION: The likely vehicles and causes of this outbreak are elucidated. Guidelines for monitoring the supply and distribution of food to future similar events should be established. Furthermore, hospitals should have protocols in place to deal with such outbreaks in a manner that facilitates epidemiological investigation.","['Karas JA', 'Nicol MP', 'Martinson N', 'Heubner R']",2001,91,5,S Afr Med J,"Karas JA, et al.

11428403,Management of reactive arthritis in a juvenile gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with long-term sulfasalazine therapy.,"A juvenile western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) experienced recurrent fever, lethargy, diarrhea, and/or arthritis starting at age 6 mo. During an episode at age 15 mo, Shigella sp. was isolated from diarrheic feces. At age 41 mo, reactive arthritis was diagnosed. In addition, the gorilla's growth was retarded. All arthritic attacks were managed symptomatically prior to age 4 yr, at which time a severe episode precipitated the implementation of therapy with sulfasalazine, an arthritis suppressive medication. Examination 27 mo later revealed cessation of progressive joint pathology although the animal exhibited decreased range of motion in most joints. The gorilla has been on sulfasalazine therapy for 4 yr without lameness. Growth has resumed, and there has been no radiographic evidence of progressive joint degeneration. Immunogenetic analysis of whole blood obtained at age 68 mo identified the gorilla major histocompatibility class I allele, Gogo-B*0101, which has limited nucleotide sequence similarity to HLA-B27, an allele associated with postinfection reactive arthritis in humans. Sulfasalazine therapy effectively managed reactive arthritis in this gorilla and should be considered for similarly frequently affected animals. Juvenile gorillas, in populations with a history of clinical shigellosis and/or postdiarrhea arthritis, may benefit from prophylactic sulfasalazine therapy after episodes of bacterial enterocolitis.

11368112,Epidemiology of postshigellosis persistent diarrhea in young children.,"BACKGROUND: Dysentery accounts for 20% of the 4.6 million diarrhea-associated deaths among children in developing countries, with the risk from death in dysenteric persistent diarrhea 10-fold higher than that in acute dysentery. Although Shigella accounts for the majority of dysenteric episodes, very little is known about the epidemiology of postshigellosis persistent diarrhea.
METHODS: Rural Bangladeshi children younger than 5 years of age (n = 1,756) were followed for 1 month after exposure to sentinel cases of Shigella dysentery. The likelihood of an acute diarrheal episode becoming persistent was assessed.
RESULTS: Diarrhea caused by Shigella was significantly associated with an increased risk of persistent diarrhea (age-adjusted relative risk, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.81). Despite the use of nalidixic acid in dysenteric episodes, persistent diarrhea occurred in 23% of children with shigellosis. Infection by multiply antibiotic-resistant Shigella isolates (age-adjusted relative risk, 3.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.51 to 9.36) and occurrence of shigellosis during infancy were observed to be risk factors for initiation of Shigella diarrhea persistence. However, 88% of the persistent shigellosis episodes occurred in older children, 50% were associated with nondysenteric shigellosis and 79% were caused by Shigella species other than Shigella dysenteriae 1.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the importance of Shigella as a cause of persistent diarrhea and indicate that strategies to prevent postshigellosis persistent diarrhea must be broad-based, with a focus on older children as well as infants, management of nondysenteric as well as dysenteric disease and prevention of diarrhea caused by multiple Shigella species.","['Ahmed F', 'Ansaruzzaman M', 'Haque E', 'Rao MR', 'Clemens JD']",2001,20,5,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Ahmed F, et al.

This difference is displayed in the virulent Shigella's ability to inhibit immune memory and secondary immune response. The existance of immunosuppressive activity in virulent Shigella has been demonstrated in the case of experimental Shigella infection in animals as well as natural infection in humans. The immunosuppressive property of Shigella sonnei is determined by the invasiveness genes of the virulence plasmid. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from virulent Shigella sonnei differs from the avirulent Shigella sonnei LPS. It possesses the property to induce in avirulent bacteria the ability to inhibit secondary immune response. This inductive immunosuppressive property of LPS is also encoded by invasiveness genes. Thus, literature data suggest that the ability to inhibit immune memory, secondary immune response and the existence of inductive immunosuppressive property in LPS are Shigella's signs of virulence as well as its ability to invade epithelial cells.",['Borisova EB'],2000,62,1,Mikrobiol Z,Borisova EB.

The CS2 cotA to -D genes, isolated from ETEC strain C91F, and the CS3 cstA to -H genes, subcloned from plasmid pCS100, were cloned into ~15-copy-number-stabilized pGA1 behind the osmotically regulated ompC promoter, resulting in high expression of both fimbriae. Under nonselective in vitro growth conditions, pGA1-CS2 and pGA1-CS3 were stable in CVD 1204, exhibiting a plasmid loss of only approximately 1% per duplication. Expression of CS2 and CS3 reduced the invasiveness of Shigella for HeLa cells and slowed the intracellular growth rate. Guinea pigs immunized intranasally with CVD 1204(pGA1-CS2) or CVD 1204(pGA1-CS3), or with a mixture of these strains, developed secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) in tears and serum IgG antibodies against Shigella lipopolysaccharide, CS2, and CS3 antigens. Moreover, the animals were protected against keratoconjunctivitis following conjunctival challenge with virulent S. flexneri 2a strain 2457T. Animals immunized with Shigella expressing CS2 or CS3 developed serum antibodies that agglutinated Shigella as well as an ETEC strain bearing the homologous fimbriae, whereas animals immunized with combined CVD 1204(pGA1-CS2) and CVD 1204(pGA1-CS3) developed antibodies that agglutinated all three test strains. These observations support the feasibility of a multivalent vaccine against shigellosis and ETEC diarrhea consisting of multiple Shigella live vectors expressing relevant ETEC antigens.","['Altboum Z', 'Barry EM', 'Losonsky G', 'Galen JE', 'Levine MM']",2001,69,5,Infect Immun,"Altboum Z, et al.

11269677,"Re-evaluating criteria for peritoneal dialysis in ""classical"" (D+) hemolytic uremic syndrome.","BACKGROUND: Indications for peritoneal dialysis in children with post-dysenteric hemolytic uremic syndrome (D+ HUS) have not been thoroughly evaluated. Although early institution of dialysis may reduce mortality, the procedure has attendant complications.
AIM: To determine whether the use of more stringent criteria for instituting dialysis had a better outcome to that of using conventional criteria.
METHOD: Following an outbreak of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 D+ HUS in KwaZulu/Natal during June 1994 to October 1995, we compared the renal outcome and mortality between two periods: before May 1995 (69 children) when conventional criteria for dialysis were employed and after May 1995 (70 children) when more stringent criteria for dialysis were applied.
RESULTS: The mean age of presentation was 35 months, 79 (56.8%) were males. Both groups were comparable except for gut perforation, which was more frequent before May 1995, and hypertension and severe disease, which were more frequent after May 1995. Seventy patients underwent dialysis, 36 (52.2%) before May 1995. There were no significant differences in renal outcome or death following discharge from hospital in both groups. Overall mortality was 20.1%, 15 (53.6%) of the 28 children that demised presented before May 1995.
OUTCOME: Accordingly, although children with more severe disease and a higher frequency of hypertension presented after May 1995, there were no significant differences in morbidity or mortality in those using stringent criteria for dialysis, compared to those in whom conventional criteria were used.
CONCLUSION: We showed that several children, who would previously have been dialyzed, may be managed conservatively, without an increase in mortality or morbidity.","['Bhimma R', 'Coovadia HM', 'Adhikari M', 'Connolly CA']",2001,55,2,Clin Nephrol,"Bhimma R, et al.

11247862,Frequency of triggering bacteria in patients with reactive arthritis and undifferentiated oligoarthritis and the relative importance of the tests used for diagnosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Reactive arthritis (ReA) triggered by Chlamydia trachomatis or enteric bacteria such as yersinia, salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, or shigella is an important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with the clinical picture of an undifferentiated oligoarthritis (UOA). This study was undertaken to evaluate the best diagnostic approach.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 52 patients with ReA, defined by arthritis and a symptomatic preceding infection of the gut or the urogenital tract, and 74 patients with possible ReA, defined by oligoarthritis without a preceding symptomatic infection and after exclusion of other diagnoses (UOA), were studied. The following diagnostic tests were applied for the identification of the triggering bacterium: for yersinia induced ReA-stool culture, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and Widal's agglutination test for detection of antibodies to yersinia; for salmonella or campylobacter induced ReA-stool culture, EIA for the detection of antibodies to salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni; for infections with shigella-stool culture; for infections with Chlamydia trachomatis-culture of the urogenital tract, microimmunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase assay for the detection of antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis.
RESULTS: A causative pathogen was identified in 29/52 (56%) of all patients with ReA. In 17 (52%) of the patients with enteric ReA one of the enteric bacteria was identified: salmonella in 11/33 (33%) and yersinia in 6/33 (18%). Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 12/19 (63%) of the patients with urogenic ReA. In patients with the clinical picture of UOA a specific triggering bacterium was also identified in 35/74 (47%) patients: yersinia in 14/74 (19%), salmonella in 9/74 (12%), and Chlamydia trachomatis in 12/74 (16%).
CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia trachomatis, yersinia, and salmonella can be identified as the causative pathogen in about 50% of patients with probable or possible ReA if the appropriate tests are used.","['Fendler C', 'Laitko S', 'Sörensen H', 'Gripenberg-Lerche C', 'Groh A', 'Uksila J', 'Granfors K', 'Braun J', 'Sieper J']",2001,60,4,Ann Rheum Dis,"Fendler C, et al.

DESIGN: Case control study.
SETTING: Nyaure Ward, Goromonzi District, Mashonaland East Province, Zimbabwe.
SUBJECTS: 52 cases and 52 controls. A case was defined as any resident of Nyaure Ward who presented with bloody diarrhoea (three or more loose stools/day) between 25 July and 25 October 1997.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequencies of symptoms, types of treatment received, risk factors for contracting the illness.
RESULTS: The median age was 17 (Q1 = 8, Q3 = 30) years for cases and 19 (Q1 = 7, Q3 = 28) years for controls. Prominent symptoms were abdominal cramps (96.2%), malaise and fever (92.3%), nausea and vomiting (50.0%). The median duration of diarrhoea was 13 (Q1 = 6, Q3 = 14) days. Eighteen (34.6%) cases were admitted and of these five were referred to a central hospital and two of them complicated with haemolytic uraemic syndrome. The case fatality rate was 1.6%. Twenty four(46.1%) of the cases had Shigella dysenteriae type I, sensitive to Nalidixic acid, Kanamycin, and Doxycycline but resistant to Metronidazole, isolated from the stool specimen. Water samples did not yield any pathogens. Significant risk factors associated with contracting dysentery were shared hand washing in the same standing water at gatherings[OR = 8.47, 95% CI: (2.43-31.33)] or within homes[OR = 60.43, 95% CI: (15.73 to 256.00)]. The use of Blair toilets was a protective factor[OR = 0.03, 95% CI: (0.01 to 0.11)].
CONCLUSION: The epidemiologic evidence implicated contamination of water used for shared hand washing before meals as the source of the infection. The common practice of shared hand washing in standing water should be discouraged at all gatherings and within households to avoid future outbreaks.","['Midzi SM', 'Tshimanga M', 'Siziya S', 'Marufu T', 'Mabiza ET']",2000,46,6,Cent Afr J Med,"Midzi SM, et al.

11232692,Increased nitrite and nitrate concentrations in sera and urine of patients with cholera or shigellosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of cell function. In the intestine, NO regulates blood flow, peristalsis, secretion, and is associated with inflammation and tissue injury. The objectives of this study were to assess and compare the role of NO in cholera, a noninflammatory enteric infection, and in shigellosis, a bacterial inflammation of the colon.
METHODS: We determined serum and urinary concentrations of nitrite and nitrate during acute illness and early convalescence in 45 hospitalized children: 24 with cholera and 21 with shigellosis; 18 healthy children served as controls. Nitrite and nitrate concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using Greiss reaction-dependent enzyme assay.
RESULTS: Serum nitrite and nitrate concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) increased during acute illness compared to the early convalescence in both cholera and shigellosis. Urinary nitrite and nitrate excretions were significantly (p < 0.01) increased during acute disease in shigellosis, but not in cholera. Nitrite concentrations correlated with stool volume (r2 = 0.851) in cholera and with leukocytosis (r2 = 0.923) in shigellosis.

The infections extended to two neighboring townships and continued to the end of 1996. Forty cases were confirmed during the period, in contrast to only one confirmed case in Nantou County in 1996 before the outbreak. All of these 41 cases in 1996 were identified as infections with Shigella flexneri serotype 2a. In order to trace the source of the infections, the 41 isolates recovered were analyzed by plasmid profile and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). There was no correlation between the plasmid profile results and the PFGE results, and the latter were used for subtyping of the 41 isolates. Twenty-two isolates (53%) had the same NotI and XbaI PFGE patterns, and 4 isolates (10%) had an additional unstable plasmid band in their NotI patterns but otherwise had the same NotI and XbaI patterns as the 22 isolates. These 26 isolates were designated the outbreak strain, and of these, 24 appeared in eight villages in one township and 2 appeared in a neighboring township. Fourteen of the remaining 15 isolates, including the isolate recovered 7 months before the outbreak, had both NotI and XbaI PFGE patterns closely related to those of the outbreak strain, indicating that Shigella infections were endemic in the area. By tracing the first isolation dates of the outbreak strain in individual villages and the neighboring township, it was found that the strain spread along the major arterial road and its branch road as time passed. Our molecular typing results and epidemiological data demonstrated the endemic nature of the outbreak strain as well as a person-to-person mode of transmission for the widespread infections the strain caused.","['Chiou CS', 'Hsu WB', 'Wei HL', 'Chen JH']",2001,39,3,J Clin Microbiol,"Chiou CS, et al.

11207612,Functional role for the class IX myosin myr5 in epithelial cell infection by Shigella flexneri.,"Efficient control of Shigella-induced, rho-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements seems to be required to shape the delicate cellular structures associated with bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. We therefore studied a class IX myosin and rho antagonist, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) myr5, for a potential role in the bacterial entry process. We show that myr5 is recruited into bacterial entry spots. The recruitment pattern resembled that of rhoC or ezrin, but not rhoA, rac or CDC42, while in vitro GAP activity of myr5 was similar for rhoA, B or C. Analysis of myr5 mutants suggested that GTPase- or ATP-binding activites are not required for Shigella-induced recruitment of this atypical myosin to the bacterial entry site. Functional studies revealed a potential dual role of the myosin functions and the GAP module of myr5 for bacterial internalization.","['Graf B', 'Bähler M', 'Hilpelä P', 'Böwe C', 'Adam T']",2000,2,6,Cell Microbiol,"Graf B, et al.

We report findings on nearly three decades of waterborne disease in Israel and the part these diseases play in the total national burden of enteric disease. During the 1970s and 1980s, Israel's community water supplies were frequently of poor quality according to the microbiological standards at that time, and the country experienced many outbreaks of waterborne enteric disease. New regulations raised water quality standards and made chlorination of community water supplies mandatory, as well as imposing more stringent guidelines on maintaining water sources and distribution systems for both surface water and groundwater. This was followed by improved compliance and water quality, and a marked decline in the number of outbreaks of waterborne disease; no outbreaks were detected between 1992 and 1997. The incidence of waterborne salmonellosis, shigellosis, and typhoid declined markedly as proportions of the total burden of these diseases, but peaked during the time in which there were frequent outbreaks of waterborne disease (1980-85). Long-term trends in the total incidence of reported infectious enteric diseases from all sources, including typhoid, shigellosis, and viral hepatitis (all types) declined, while the total incidence of salmonellosis increased. Mandatory chlorination has had an important impact on improving water quality, in reducing outbreaks of waterborne disease in Israel, and reducing the total burden of enteric disease in the country.","['Tulchinsky TH', 'Burla E', 'Clayman M', 'Sadik C', 'Brown A', 'Goldberger S']",2000,78,12,Bull World Health Organ,"Tulchinsky TH, et al.

11179298,Safety and immunogenicity of improved Shigella O-specific polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines in adults in Israel.,"Data suggest that the O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) domain of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Shigella species is both an essential virulence factor and a protective antigen and that a critical level of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) to this antigen will confer immunity to shigellosis. Because covalent attachment of polysaccharides to proteins increases their immunogenicity, especially in infants and in young children, the O-SP of Shigella species were bound to medically useful proteins, and the safety and immunogenicity of the resultant conjugates were confirmed in adults and 4- to 7-year-old children. Succinylation of the carrier protein improved the immunogenicity of Shigella conjugates in mice and increased their yield. Based on these results, a clinical trial of O-SP conjugates of Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri 2a bound to succinylated mutant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (rEPAsucc) or native or succinylated Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin mutant (CRM9 or CRM9succ) was conducted in healthy adults. The conjugates were safe and immunogenic. S. sonnei-CRM9, S. sonnei-CRM9succ, and S. sonnei-rEPAsucc elicited significant rises of geometric mean (GM) IgG anti-LPS within 1 week of injection (P < 0.001). At 26 weeks, the GM anti-LPS levels elicited by these three conjugates were similar and higher than their prevaccination levels (P < 0.0001). GM IgG anti-LPS levels elicited by S. flexneri 2a-rEPAsucc were significantly higher than those elicited by S. flexneri 2a-rCRM9succ at all intervals after injection. At 26 weeks, the levels of IgG anti-LPS in vaccinees were higher than their prevaccination levels (P < 0.0001). The serum antibody responses were specific, as there was no significant rise of anti-LPS to the heterologous O-SP in any vaccinee. Both conjugates elicited statistically significant rises of serum antibodies to the injected carrier protein. At 6 months, these five Shigella conjugates elicited higher fold rises than similar conjugates (D. N. Taylor et al., Infect. Immun. 61:3678-3687, 1993).

11177193,Effect of an energy-dense diet on the clinical course of acute shigellosis in undernourished children.,"To date there have been few reports on the impact of dietary intervention on the clinical course of acute shigellosis. Current management of acute shigellosis is primarily focused on antibiotic therapy with less emphasis on nutritional management. In a randomised clinical trial, we examined the role of an energy-dense diet on the clinical outcome in malnourished children with acute dysentery due to shigellosis. Seventy-five children aged 12--48 months with acute dysentery randomly received either a milk--cereal formula with an energy density of 4960 kJ/l (test group) or a milk-cereal formula with energy of 2480 kJ/l (control group) for 10 d in hospital. In both milk-cereal formulas, protein provided 11 % energy. In addition, the standard hospital diet was offered to all children and all children received an appropriate antibiotic for 5 d. The mean food intakes (g/kg per d) in the test and control groups were: 112 (SE 2.28) and 116 (SE 3.48) on day 1; 118 (SE 2.72) and 107 (SE 3.13) on day 5; 120 (SE 2.25) and 100 (SE 3.83) on day 10. The mean energy intakes (kJ/kg per d) in the test and control groups respectively were: 622 (SE 13.2) and 315 (SE 11.3) on day 1; 655 (SE 15.1) and 311 (SE 7.98) on day 5; 672 (SE 14.7) and 294 (SE 11.1) on day 10. The food and energy intakes were mostly from the milk-cereal diet. There was no difference between two groups in resolution of fever, dysenteric (bloody and or mucoid) stools, stool frequency and tenesmus. However, vomiting was more frequently observed among the test-group children during the first 5 d of intervention (67 % v. 41 %, There was an increase in the mean weight-for-age (%) in the test group compared with the control group after the 10 d of dietary intervention (6.2 (SE 0.6) v. 2.7 (SE 0.4), In addition, resolution of rectal prolapse was better (26 % v. 8 %, in the test group v. control group after 5 d, and 13 % v. 6 %, after 10 d of dietary intervention.

Several studies confirm their importance at epithelial surfaces as immediate barrier effectors in preventing infection. Here we report that early in Shigella spp. infections, expression of the antibacterial peptides LL-37 and human beta-defensin-1 is reduced or turned off. The downregulation is detected in biopsies from patients with bacillary dysenteries and in Shigella- infected cell cultures of epithelial and monocyte origin. This downregulation of immediate defense effectors might promote bacterial adherence and invasion into host epithelium and could be an important virulence parameter.

11171613,Microbes and microbial toxins: paradigms for microbial-mucosal interactions III. Shigellosis: from symptoms to molecular pathogenesis.,"Interaction of Shigella flexneri with epithelial cells includes contact of bacteria with the cell surface and release of Ipa proteins through a specialized type III secreton. A complex signaling process involving activation of small GTPases of the Rho family and c-src causes major rearrangements of the subcortical cytoskeleton, thereby allowing bacterial entry by macropinocytosis. After entry, shigellae escape to the cell cytoplasm and initiate intracytoplasmic movement through polar nucleation and assembly of actin filaments caused by bacterial surface protein IcsA, which binds and activates neuronal Wiskoff-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), thus inducing actin nucleation in an Arp 2/3-dependent mechanism. Actin-driven motility promotes efficient colonization of the host cell cytoplasm and rapid cell-to-cell spread via protrusions that are engulfed by adjacent cells in a cadherin-dependent process. Bacterial invasion turns infected cells to strongly proinflammatory cells through sustained activation of nuclear factor-kappaB. A major consequence is interleukin (IL)-8 production, which attracts polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). On transmigration, PMNs disrupt the permeability of this epithelium and promote its invasion by shigellae. At the early stage of infection, M cells of the follicle-associated epithelium allow bacterial translocation. Subsequent apoptotic killing of macrophages in a caspase 1-dependent process causes the release of IL-1beta and IL-18, which accounts for the initial steps of inflammation.",['Sansonetti PJ'],2001,280,3,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,Sansonetti PJ.

11168726,A colony blot immunoassay to detect enteroinvasive Escherichia coli and Shigella in water samples.,"AIMS: The aim of the study was to develop a colony blot immunoassay to detect Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) in water.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Spiked samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes. Colony prints on the filters were tested with a monoclonal antibody specific to IpaC, an antigen coded by the invasion plasmid of Shigella and EIEC. Invasive pathogens could be successfully detected with the technique, even in the presence of a large number of non-pathogenic bacterial cells. The method was significantly more sensitive in identifying pathogen-containing samples then the traditional culture-based approach.
CONCLUSION: The IpaC-specific colony blot immunoassay is an inexpensive method for identifying the aetiological agents of bacillary dysentery in water samples.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The technique could be particularly useful in detecting enteroinvasive E. coli which often remains undetected by bio- and serotyping.","['Szakál D', 'Gadó I', 'Pál T']",2001,90,2,J Appl Microbiol,"Szakál D, et al.

11160004,Parameters underlying successful protection with live attenuated mutants in experimental shigellosis.,"Because the use of live attenuated mutants of Shigella spp. represents a promising approach to protection against bacillary dysentery (M. E. Etherridge, A. T. M. Shamsul Hoque, and D. A. Sack, Lab. Anim. Sci. 46:61-66, 1996), it becomes essential to rationalize this approach in animal models in order to optimize attenuation of virulence in the vaccine candidates, as well as their route and mode of administration, and to define the correlates of protection. In this study, we have compared three strains of Shigella flexneri 5--the wild-type M90T, an aroC mutant, and a double purE aroC mutant--for their pathogenicity, immunogenicity, and protective capacity. Protection against keratoconjunctivitis, induced by wild-type M90T, was used as the protection read out in guinea pigs that were inoculated either intranasally or intragastrically. Following intranasal immunization, the aroC mutant elicited weak nasal tissue destruction compared to M90T and achieved protection correlated with high levels of local anti-lipopolysaccharide immunoglobulin A (IgA), whereas the purE aroC double mutant, which also elicited weak tissue destruction, was not protective and elicited a low IgA response. Conversely, following intragastric immunization, only the M90T purE aroC double mutant elicited protection compared to both the aroC mutant and the wild-type strain. This mutant caused mild inflammatory destruction, particularly at the level of Peyer's patches, but it persisted much longer within the tissues. This could represent an essential parameter of the protective response that, in this case, did not clearly correlate with high anti-lipopolysaccharide IgA titers.","['Bernardini ML', 'Arondel J', 'Martini I', 'Aidara A', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2001,69,2,Infect Immun,"Bernardini ML, et al.

11158126,Clonal relationships among Shigella serotypes suggested by cryptic flagellin gene polymorphism.,"The presence of cryptic fliC alleles in the genomes of 120 strains representative of the four Shigella species was investigated. One fragment was obtained by PCR amplification of fliC, with a size varying from 1.2 to 3.2 kbp, depending on the species or serotype. After digestion with endonuclease HhaI, the number of fragments in patterns varied from three to nine, with sizes of between 115 and 1,020 bp. Patterns sharing most of their bands were grouped to constitute an F type. A total of 17 different F types were obtained from all strains included in this study. A unique pattern was observed for each the following serotypes: Shigella dysenteriae 1, 2, 8, and 10 and S. boydii 7, 13, 15, 16, and 17. On the contrary, S. dysenteriae serotype 13 and S. sonnei biotype e were each subdivided into two different F types. S. flexneri serotypes 3a and X could be distinguished from the cluster containing S. flexneri serotypes 1 to 5 and Y. S. flexneri serotype 6 clustered with S. boydii serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, and 18 and S. dysenteriae serotypes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12. Two other clusters were outlined: one comprising S. dysenteriae serotypes 3, 12, 13 (strain CDC598-77), 14, and 15 and the other one joining S. boydii serotypes 5 and 9. None of the 17 fliC patterns was found in the fliC HhaI pattern database previously described for Escherichia coli.

All French isolates, as well as strain 96-204, showed biochemical reactions typical of S. dysenteriae and gave positive results in a PCR assay for detection of the plasmid ipaH gene coding for invasiveness. No Shiga toxin gene was detected by PCR. These isolates were indistinguishable by molecular analysis of ribosomal DNA (ribotyping) and seemed to be related to S. dysenteriae serotypes 3 and 12.

Among the effectors of the immune system of the colonic mucosa are translocation sites corresponding to lymphatic follicles carrying a follicular epithelium in the presence of M cells. These cells capture molecules, particles and microorganisms from the intestinal barrier that they translocate to immune competent cells present in the follicles (antigen presenting cells including resident macrophages and then B and T lymphocytes). MACROPHAGE APTOTOSIS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES: The first cell infected by Shigella appears to be the macrophage once the translocation has been made via the M cells. This infection rapidly leads to apoptotic death of the macrophage allowing the Shigella to infect the laterobasal epithelial cells and the development of an inflammatory response.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
SETTING: University Center for Vaccine Development.
SUBJECTS: Fifty-four volunteers with experimentally induced influenza A, 45 with S. sonnei, and 21 with R. rickettsii infections participated.
INTERVENTIONS: Subjects from the six influenza A studies were challenged intranasally. If they met certain criteria, they were offered aspirin or acetaminophen for symptomatic relief. Subjects from the three Shigella studies were challenged with the bacteria and then given trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Acetaminophen also could be administered. In the one R. rickettsii trial, subjects were inoculated intradermally and treated with tetracycline. Again, acetaminophen was administered for symptomatic relief.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data, excerpted from subjects' study records, were evaluated using Wilcoxon tests, Spearman's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis. Two-tailed hypotheses with a p value of 0.05 were used for all of the analyses. There was a striking correlation between antipyretic therapy and duration of illness in subjects infected with influenza A and S. sonnei, but not R. rickettsii.
CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate analysis suggested that antipyretic therapy prolonged illness in subjects infected with influenza A, but its use was the result of prolonged illness in those infected with S. sonnei. The precise nature of these relationships requires a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","['Plaisance KI', 'Kudaravalli S', 'Wasserman SS', 'Levine MM', 'Mackowiak PA']",2000,20,12,Pharmacotherapy,"Plaisance KI, et al.

11123692,Identification of functional regions within invasion plasmid antigen C (IpaC) of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella flexneri causes bacillary dysentery with symptoms resulting from the inflammation that accompanies bacterial entry into the cells of the colonic epithelium. The effectors of S. flexneri invasion are the Ipa proteins, particularly IpaB and IpaC, which are secreted at the host-pathogen interface following bacterial contact with a host cell. Of the purified Ipa proteins, only IpaC has been shown to possess quantifiable in vitro activities that are related to cellular invasion. In this study, ipaC deletion mutants were generated to identify functional regions within the IpaC protein. From these data, we now know that the N-terminus and an immunogenic central region are not required for IpaC-dependent enhancement of cellular invasion by S. flexneri. However, to restore invasiveness to an ipaC null mutant of S. flexneri, the N-terminus is essential, because IpaC mutants lacking the N-terminus are not secreted by the bacterium. Deletion of the central hydrophobic region eliminates IpaC's ability to interact with phospholipid membranes, and fusion of this region to a modified form of green fluorescent protein converts it into an efficient membrane-associating protein. Meanwhile, deletion of the C-terminus eliminates the mutant protein's ability to establish protein-protein contacts with full-length IpaC. Interestingly, the mutant form of ipaC that restores partial invasiveness to the S. flexneri ipaC null mutant also restores full contact-mediated haemolysis activity to this bacterium. These data support a model in which IpaC possesses a distinct functional organization that is important for bacterial invasion. This information will be important in defining the precise role of IpaC in S. flexneri pathogenesis and in exploring the potential effects of purified IpaC at mucosal surfaces.","['Picking WL', 'Coye L', 'Osiecki JC', 'Barnoski Serfis A', 'Schaper E', 'Picking WD']",2001,39,1,Mol Microbiol,"Picking WL, et al.

11115111,The virulence plasmid pWR100 and the repertoire of proteins secreted by the type III secretion apparatus of Shigella flexneri.,"Bacteria of Shigella spp. are the causative agents of shigellosis. The virulence traits of these pathogens include their ability to enter into epithelial cells and induce apoptosis in macrophages. Expression of these functions requires the Mxi-Spa type III secretion apparatus and the secreted IpaA-D proteins, all of which are encoded by a virulence plasmid. In wild-type strains, the activity of the secretion apparatus is tightly regulated and induced upon contact of bacteria with epithelial cells. To investigate the repertoire of proteins secreted by Shigella flexneri in conditions of active secretion, we determined the N-terminal sequence of 14 proteins that are secreted by a mutant in which secretion was deregulated. Sequencing of the virulence plasmid pWR100 of the S. flexneri strain M90T (serotype 5) has allowed us to identify the genes encoding these secreted proteins and suggests that approximately 25 proteins are secreted by the type III secretion apparatus. Analysis of the G+C content and the relative positions of genes and open reading frames carried by the plasmid, together with information concerning the localization and function of encoded proteins, suggests that pWR100 contains blocks of genes of various origins, some of which were initially carried by four different plasmids.","['Buchrieser C', 'Glaser P', 'Rusniok C', 'Nedjari H', ""D'Hauteville H"", 'Kunst F', 'Sansonetti P', 'Parsot C']",2000,38,4,Mol Microbiol,"Buchrieser C, et al.

This practise influenced the change in the epidemiological feature of dysentery in 1998: increase of cases due to S. flexneri infection (all together 36% of cases) mostly serological type 4a, and decrease of cases due to S. sonnei infection (from 90% to 60%). There were no more summer-autumn seasonal increase in number of monthly registered dysentery cases in July-September but spring increase March-May was observed that is rather unusual in Poland.

Disease rates, reflected as rate ratios, were higher in the border region for botulism, brucellosis, diphtheria, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rabies, rubella, salmonellosis, and shigellosis than in either of 2 nonborder comparison regions.

10992446,Tripeptidyl peptidase II promotes maturation of caspase-1 in Shigella flexneri-induced macrophage apoptosis.,"The invasive enteropathogenic bacterium Shigella flexneri activates apoptosis in macrophages. Shigella-induced apoptosis requires caspase-1. We demonstrate here that tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII), a cytoplasmic, high-molecular-weight protease, participates in the apoptotic pathway triggered by Shigella. The TPPII inhibitor Ala-Ala-Phe-chloromethylketone (AAF-cmk) and clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone (lactacystin), an inhibitor of both TPPII and the proteasome, protected macrophages from Shigella-induced apoptosis. AAF-cmk was more potent than lactacystin and irreversibly blocked Shigella-induced apoptosis by 95% at a concentration of 1 microM. Conversely, peptide aldehyde and peptide vinylsulfone proteasome inhibitors had little effect on Shigella-mediated cytotoxicity. Both AAF-cmk and lactacystin prevented the maturation of pro-caspase-1 and its substrate pro-interleukin 1beta in Shigella-infected macrophages, indicating that TPPII is upstream of caspase-1. Neither of these compounds directly inhibited caspase-1. AAF-cmk and lactacystin did not impair macrophage phagocytosis or the ability of Shigella to escape the macrophage phagosome. TPPII was also found to be involved in apoptosis induced by ATP and the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. We propose that TPPII participates in apoptotic pathways.","['Hilbi H', 'Puro RJ', 'Zychlinsky A']",2000,68,10,Infect Immun,"Hilbi H, et al.

10984429,Myosin light chain kinase plays an essential role in S. flexneri dissemination.,"Shigella flexneri, the causitive agent of bacillary dysentery, has been shown to disseminate in colonic epithelial cells via protrusions that extend from infected cells and are endocytosed by adjacent cells. This phenomenon occurs in the region of the eukaryotic cell's adherens junctions and is inhibited by pharmacological reagents or host cell mutations that completely disrupt the junctional complex. In this study, inhibitors of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) were shown to dramatically decrease intercellular spread of S. flexneri but to have no inhibitory effect on bacterial entry, multiplication or actin-based motility within the host cell. Furthermore, cell-to-cell spread of Listeria monocytogenes, another bacterial pathogen that uses an actin-based mechanism to move within the eukaryotic cytoplasm and to spread from cell to cell, was not affected by the MLCK inhibitors, indicating that (1) the inhibition of S. flexneri cell-to-cell spread in treated cells is not due to a complete break down of cell-cell contacts, which was subsequently confirmed by confocal microscopy, and (2) MLCK plays a role in a S. flexneri-specific mechanism of dissemination. Myosin has been shown to play a role in a variety of membrane-based phenomena. The work presented here suggests that activation of this molecule via phosphorylation by MLCK, at the very least participates in the formation of the bacteria-containing protrusion, and could also contribute to the endocytosis of this structure by neighboring cells.","['Rathman M', 'de Lanerolle P', 'Ohayon H', 'Gounon P', 'Sansonetti P']",2000,113 Pt 19,,J Cell Sci,"Rathman M, et al.

DESIGN: Retrospective.
METHODS: From an automated data bank data were collected on all registered shigellosis patients in Amsterdam in the period 1991-1998, and their contacts found by contact tracing.
RESULTS: 567 Patients with shigellosis had been reported and a Shigella infection has been diagnosed in 96 of the 983 contacts. The annual incidence decreased statistically significantly from 13 to 8/100.000. 329 males and 334 females were infected. The highest number of cases was found in children from 0-4 years and among adults from 20-34 years. Of the 663 patients 106 (16%) required hospitalization; for children under 7 this proportion was 30% (32/108). Among the contacts (excluding the 14 contacts with the same foreign source and the same first sickness day as the index patient) the secondary attack rate was 8%. Young age, of both the patient and the contact was independently related to a higher secondary attack rate.

10976810,Endocrine-immune interaction: alteractions in immune function resulting from neonatal treatment with a GnRH antagonist and seasonality in male primates.,"PROBLEM: The effect of neonatal gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist (Ant) treatment and seasonality on immune system development and function was investigated in male primates.
METHOD OF STUDY: Neonatal male rhesus monkeys and marmosets were treated with Ant, and its effect on immune system morphology, circulating lymphocyte subsets, and cell- and humorally-mediated immune responses was assessed during development. In adult rhesus monkeys, we correlated seasonal changes in immune function with circannual fluctuations in immunoactive hormones.
RESULTS: In neonatal marmosets, Ant reduced the number of B cells and T cells in the thymic medulla and T cells in the periarterial lymphatic sheaths (PALS) of the spleen. Ant also altered the development of, but did not permanently impair, the proliferative index (PI) of blood lymphocytes to mitogens. In vitro treatment of control lymphocytes with GnRH analogues altered their response to these proliferative agents. In neonatal rhesus monkeys, Ant treatment increased the frequency of clinical problems, lowered circulating levels of lymphocytes, total T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells, and altered the PI of lymphocytes to mitogens. As adults, the cell- and humorally-mediated immune responses remained impaired. We also documented seasonal fluctuations in the prevalence of diseases, circulating immune cells and immune function in rhesus monkeys. The number of cases of campylobacteriosis and shigellosis was lowest in the winter and highest in the spring. Circulating numbers of white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils and the PI of lymphocytes to mitogens were higher in the winter than in the summer. Natural killer cell activity also varied with season. Cortisol and leptin secretion exhibited circannual rhythms, rising in concert with decreasing photoperiod and increasing testicular activity in the fall. Conversely, prolactin levels declined with decreasing photoperiod and then rose in the spring.
CONCLUSION: Neonatal exposure of male primates to Ant appears to alter early postnatal programming of immune function. In the rhesus monkey, immune function shows seasonal fluctuations that may be driven by circannual changes in the secretion of immunoactive hormones.","['Mann DR', 'Akinbami MA', 'Lunn SF', 'Fraser HM', 'Gould KG', 'Ansari AA']",2000,44,1,Am J Reprod Immunol,"Mann DR, et al.

Cluster 1 contains the majority of Boydii and Dysenteriae strains (B1-4, B6, B8, B10, B14, and B18; and D3-7, D9, and D11-13) plus Flexneri 6 and 6A. Cluster 2 contains seven Boydii strains (B5, B7, B9, B11, B15, B16, and B17) and Dysenteriae 2. Cluster 3 contains one Boydii strain (B12) and the Flexneri serotypes 1-5 strains. Sonnei and three Dysenteriae strains (D1, D8, and D10) are outside of the three main clusters but, nonetheless, are clearly within Escherichia coli. Boydii 13 was found to be distantly related to E. coli. Shigella strains, like the other pathogenic forms of E. coli, do not have a single evolutionary origin, indicating convergent evolution of Shigella phenotypic properties. We estimate the three main Shigella clusters to have evolved within the last 35,000 to 270,000 years, suggesting that shigellosis was one of the early infectious diseases of humans.","['Pupo GM', 'Lan R', 'Reeves PR']",2000,97,19,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Pupo GM, et al.

10917383,Clinical use of fluoroquinolones in children.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of fluoroquinolones in children.
DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (January 1966-March 1998) was conducted for relevant literature.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Data from compassionate use and published studies were reviewed for the assessment of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of fluoroquinolones in children.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Fluoroquinolones have a broad spectrum coverage of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and intracellular organisms. Fluoroquinolones are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, have excellent tissue penetration, low protein binding, and long elimination half-lives. These antibiotics are effective in treating various infections and are well tolerated in adults. However, the use of fluoroquinolones in children has been restricted due to potential cartilage damage that occurred in research with immature animals. Fluoroquinolones have been used in children on a compassionate basis. Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used fluoroquinolone in children, most often in the treatment of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis as well as salmonellosis and shigellosis. Other uses include chronic suppurative otitis media, meningitis, septicemia, and urinary tract infection. Safety data of fluoroquinolones in children appear to be similar to those in adults. Fluoroquinolones are associated with tendinitis and reversible arthralgia in adults and children. However, direct association between fluoroquinolones and arthropathy remains uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroquinolones have been found to be effective in treating certain infections in children. Additional research is needed to define the optimal dosage regimens in pediatric patients. Although fluoroquinolones appear to be well tolerated, further investigations are needed to determine the risk of arthropathy in children. However, their use in children should not be withheld when the benefits outweigh the risks.","['Alghasham AA', 'Nahata MC']",2000,34,3,Ann Pharmacother,Alghasham AA and Nahata MC.

Due to the increased risk of exposure, children's caregivers in day-care centers may have a higher incidence of diarrhea, particularly when caring for very young children. We therefore examined the incidence of diarrhea and antibodies to Shigella among caregivers in day-care centers, according to age groups of children in their care (< 18, 18-34, and > 35 months) and in comparison with the general population. 2 studies with a retrospective cohort and seroepidemiological cross-sectional design were carried out. Questionnaires were completed by 401 caregivers in 36% of all WIZO day-care centers. As a measure of past exposure to Shigella, levels of S. sonnei and S. flexneri antibodies were examined in the blood of 110 caregivers (ELISA method). There was a higher incidence of diarrhea among young children, increasing the potential exposure to diarrheal agents among their caregivers. Nevertheless, no statistically significant differences in diarrhea incidence were found among caregivers of the various age groups during the previous year (p = 0.768) and during the previous month (p = 0.319), nor in absenteeism due to diarrhea during the last month (p = 0.761). Levels of Shigella antibodies were similar among caregivers in all 3 groups. Diarrheal incidence was higher among women in the population control group than among caregivers during the previous year (p = 0.005) and month (p = 0.067). No statistically significant differences in levels of S. sonnei and S. flexneri antibodies were found between caregivers and women in the control group. There was no evidence that diarrhea is an occupational hazard for caregivers of young children. An explanation may be the development of protective immunity against common diarrheal agents due to recurrent exposure.","['Koton S', 'Cohen D', 'Green MS']",1999,136,2,Harefuah,"Koton S, et al.

DESIGN: Hospital based prognostic study.
SETTING: Paediatric wards in Harare and Parirenyatwa tertiary referral hospitals.
SUBJECTS: All children aged one month to 12 years admitted to the wards with a history of bloody diarrhoea between January 1993 to June 30 1994 were included in the study (n = 312).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patterns of complications and predictors of mortality.
RESULTS: The peak age group of the patients was 12 to 23 months. Ninety five children died giving an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of 30.4% (95% CI, 25.3 to 35.6). One third (n = 107) had haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), among whom the CFR was 43%.

In our report, 67.6% of these patients were amebic dysentery, 19.3% were combined infection with amebic and Shigella sonnei dysentery, and 13.1% were Shigella sonnei dysentery. Therefore, amebic dysentery was the predominant cause during this outbreak. The clinical features of this outbreak were, in descending order, watery stool, fever, abdominal pain, mucinous stool and bloody stool. No concurrent liver abscess was discerned. Because there had not been such a clustering of dysentery in Taichung for so many years, we thought that travel to endemic areas might have been the underlying predisposing cause. Most of the school water supplying system was ground water, which might have been contaminated by a few patients returning from endemic areas. We thought that fecal-oral route by contaminated water might have been the primary transmission route.","['Lai SW', 'Lin HC', 'Lin CC', 'Liu CS', 'Shih YT', 'Peng CT', 'Tsai CH', 'Tsai FJ', 'Ng KC']",2000,41,1,Acta Paediatr Taiwan,"Lai SW, et al.

Studies in recent years have reported identification of several enteropathogens directly from stool samples by PCR. The amplification process includes the use of primers complementary to the DNA sequences specific to the pathogen, thus relying on the pathogen's genotype, rather than its phenotype on which identification by the methods of classical microbiology were based. We have developed PCR protocols for the differential identification of enteropathogens resembling the normal flora (enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), E. coli O-157), Shigella spp, and the detection of enteropathogens that can not be grown on classic growth media (Norwalk virus). The amplification process is inhibited by several substrates present in fecal material (phenol, hemoglobin), limiting DNA extraction by phenol. The protocols we have developed for direct detection of Shigella spp and ETEC in stools circumvent inhibition of PCR by the use of a 4-hour pre-enrichment step in brain-heart infusion broth. Rapid and accurate identification of enteropathogens is important for prompt and focused intervention to stop the chain of transmission in outbreaks of gastroenteritis in military and civilian populations.","['Yavzori M', 'Uriel N', 'Porat N', 'Dagan R', 'Ambar R', 'Shpilberg O', 'Cohen D']",2000,138,9,Harefuah,"Yavzori M, et al.

10877166,Treatment of shigellosis with cefixime: two days vs. five days.,"BACKGROUND: Although the recommended standard course of therapy for shigellosis is 5 days of oral ampicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy, successful outcome has been reported in adults treated with abbreviated courses of antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to compare short course (2-day) vs. 5-day therapy with cefixime for treatment of diarrheal disease caused by Shigella sonnei in children.
METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were eligible if they were at least 6 months of age and presented to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh during an outbreak of diarrhea caused by S. sonnei, with (1) a history of fever and diarrhea (at least three loose or watery stools per day), (2) bloody diarrhea or (3) diarrhea and known exposure to an individual with documented shigellosis. Patients were randomized to receive either 2 days of cefixime (8 mg/kg(day) given once daily followed by 3 days of placebo or 5 days of cefixime. Telephone follow-up was performed on Days 3, 7 and 14 after enrollment. Follow-up stool cultures were obtained on Day 7 to assess bacteriologic cure. There were standardized definitions for cure, improvement, failure and relapse.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled. Eleven were eliminated from analysis because their stool cultures were not positive for S. sonnei. There were 36 evaluable patients, 21 in the 2-day group and 15 in the 5-day group. Patients ranged in age from 6 months to 17 years. Forty-four percent of the subjects were male. Symptoms were improved or had resolved by Day 3 of therapy in all patients. There were 8 patients who experienced a clinical relapse: 5 of 21 (24%) patients in the 2-day treatment group and 3 of 15 (20%) in the 5-day group. There were 13 patients who experienced a bacteriologic failure (defined as the occurrence of a positive culture at the Day 7 follow-up visit), 11 of 20 (55%) in the 2-day group and 2 of 14 (14%) in the 5-day group (P < 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Two- and 5-day treatment courses with cefixime for treatment of diarrheal disease caused by S. sonnei result in similar rates of clinical cure and clinical relapses; however, there was a higher rate of bacteriologic failure with shorter course therapy.","['Martin JM', 'Pitetti R', 'Maffei F', 'Tritt J', 'Smail K', 'Wald ER']",2000,19,6,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Martin JM, et al.

10874731,The pathogenesis of Shigella flexneri infection: lessons from in vitro and in vivo studies.,"Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative facultatively intracellular pathogen responsible for bacillary dysentery in humans. More than one million deaths occur yearly due to infections with Shigella spp. and the victims are mostly children of the developing world. The pathogenesis of Shigella centres on the ability of this organism to invade the colonic epithelium where it induces severe mucosal inflammation. Much information that we have gained concerning the pathogenesis of Shigella has been derived from the study of in vitro models of infection. Using these techniques, a number of the molecular mechanisms by which Shigella invades epithelial cells and macrophages have been identified. In vivo models of shigellosis have been hampered since humans are the only natural hosts of Shigella. However, experimental infection of macaques as well as the murine lung and rabbit ligated ileal loop models have been important in defining some of the immune and inflammatory components of the disease. In particular, the murine lung model has shed light on the development of systemic and local immune protection against Shigella infection. It would be naive to believe that any one model of Shigella infection could adequately represent the complexity of the disease in humans, and more sophisticated in vivo models are now necessary. These models require the use of human cells and tissue, but at present such models remain in the developmental stage. Ultimately, however, it is with such studies that novel treatments and vaccine candidates for the treatment and prevention of shigellosis will be designed.","['Philpott DJ', 'Edgeworth JD', 'Sansonetti PJ']",2000,355,1397,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philpott DJ, et al.

10867004,Profilin is required for sustaining efficient intra- and intercellular spreading of Shigella flexneri.,"The ability of Shigella to mediate actin-based motility within the host cell is a prominent pathogenic feature of bacillary dysentery. The ability is dependent on the interaction of VirG with neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), which in turn mediates recruitment of Arp2/3 complex and several actin-related proteins. In the present study, we show that profilin I is essential to the rapid movement of Shigella in epithelial cells, for which the capacity of profilin to interact with G-actin and N-WASP is critical. In COS-7 cells overexpressing either mutated profilin H119E, which failed to bind G-actin, or H133S, which is unable to interact with poly-l-proline, Shigella motility was significantly inhibited. Similarly, depletion of profilin from Xenopus egg extracts resulted in a decrease in bacterial motility that was completely rescued by adding back profilin I but not H119E or H133S. In COS-7 cells overexpressing a N-WASP mutant lacking the proline-rich domain (Deltap) unable to interact with profilin, the actin tail formation of intracellular Shigella was inhibited. In N-WASP-depleted extracts, addition of Deltap but not full-length N-WASP was unable to restore the bacterial motility. Furthermore, in a plaque formation assay with Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers infected by Shigella, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing H119E, H133S, or Deltap reduced the bacterial cell-to-cell spreading. These results indicate that profilin I associated with N-WASP is an essential host factor for sustaining efficient intra- and intercellular spreading of Shigella.","['Mimuro H', 'Suzuki T', 'Suetsugu S', 'Miki H', 'Takenawa T', 'Sasakawa C']",2000,275,37,J Biol Chem,"Mimuro H, et al.

FoodNet is a collaborative effort of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Infectious Diseases, the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, and state health departments in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, and Oregon. The population under active surveillance for foodborne infections was approximately 16.1 million persons or roughly 6% of the United States Population. Through weekly or monthly contact with all clinical laboratories in these sites, 8,576 total isolations were recorded: 2,205 cases of salmonellosis, 1,273 cases of shigellosis, 468 cases of cryptosporidiosis, 340 of E. coli O157:H7 infections, 139 of yersiniosis, 77 of listeriosis, 51 of Vibrio infections, and 49 of cyclosporiasis. Results from 1997 demonstrate that while there are regional and seasonal differences in reported incidence rates of certain bacterial and parasitic diseases, and that some pathogens showed a change in incidence from 1996, the overall incidence of illness caused by pathogens under surveillance was stable.

10843411,Disease-dependent changes in T-cell populations in patients with shigellosis.,"In shigellosis, bacterial infection is associated with an extensive inflammation of the rectal mucosa, resulting in bloody dysentery. The role of T-cell-mediated pro-inflammatory mechanisms has been implicated in this process, but the specific role of T-cell subsets is still not well understood. In this study we attempted to identify the changes in T-cell populations in patients with shigellosis during the disease course. The T-cell subset distribution was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the rectal mucosa and by immuno-flow cytometry in the peripheral blood. Blood and rectal biopsies were studied from patients with Shigella dysenteriae 1 (n= 11) and S. flexneri (n= 11) infection and 20 healthy age-matched controls. We found an expansion of gammadelta+T cells in the rectal mucosa, but a decrease in the percentage of gammadelta+T cells in the blood in acute shigellosis. There was also a preferential increase in CD8+ T cells in the surface epithelium of rectal tissue in patients infected with S. dysenteriae 1, but not in patients infected with S. flexneri. Our findings suggest that the rectal mucosal inflammation in shigellosis is associated with an expansion of T cells, in particular CD8+ and gammadelta+T-cell subsets in the gut mucosa, which may be of importance for the pathogenesis of shigellosis.","['Islam D', 'Christensson B']",2000,108,4,APMIS,Islam D and Christensson B.

10843390,Caspase-1 activation of IL-1beta and IL-18 are essential for Shigella flexneri-induced inflammation.,"Caspases are intracellular proteases that mediate mammalian cell apoptosis. Caspase-1 (Casp-1) is a unique caspase because it activates the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. Shigella flexneri, the etiological agent of bacillary dysentery, induces macrophage apoptosis, which requires Casp-1 and results in the release of mature IL-1beta and IL-18. Here we show that casp-1(-/-) mice infected with S. flexneri do not develop the acute inflammation characteristic of shigellosis and are unable to resolve the bacterial infection. Using casp-1(-/-) mice supplemented with recombinant cytokines and experiments with IL-1beta(-/-) and IL-18(-/-) mice, we show that IL-1beta and IL-18 are both required to mediate inflammation in S. flexneri infections. Together, these data demonstrate the importance of Casp-1 in acute inflammation and show the different roles of its substrates, IL-1beta and IL-18, in this response.","['Sansonetti PJ', 'Phalipon A', 'Arondel J', 'Thirumalai K', 'Banerjee S', 'Akira S', 'Takeda K', 'Zychlinsky A']",2000,12,5,Immunity,"Sansonetti PJ, et al.

10839806,Rho family GTPase Cdc42 is essential for the actin-based motility of Shigella in mammalian cells.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, is capable of directing its movement within host cells by exploiting actin dynamics. The VirG protein expressed at one pole of the bacterium can recruit neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), a downstream effector of Cdc42. Here, we show that Cdc42 is required for the actin-based motility of Shigella. Microinjection of a dominant active mutant Cdc42, but not Rac1 or RhoA, into Swiss 3T3 cells accelerated Shigella motility. In add-back experiments in Xenopus egg extracts, addition of a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for the Rho family, RhoGDI, greatly diminished the bacterial motility or actin assembly, which was restored by adding activated Cdc42. In N-WASP-depleted extracts, the bacterial movement almost arrested was restored by adding exogenous N-WASP but not H208D, an N-WASP mutant defective in binding to Cdc42. In pyrene actin assay, Cdc42 enhanced VirG-stimulating actin polymerization by N-WASP-actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 complex. Actually, Cdc42 stimulated actin cloud formation on the surface of bacteria expressing VirG in a solution containing N-WASP, Arp2/3 complex, and G-actin. Immunohistological study of Shigella-infected cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged Cdc42 revealed that Cdc42 accumulated by being colocalized with actin cloud at one pole of intracellular bacterium. Furthermore, overexpression of H208D mutant in cells interfered with the actin assembly of infected Shigella and diminished the intra- and intercellular spreading. These results suggest that Cdc42 activity is involved in initiating actin nucleation mediated by VirG-N-WASP-Arp2/3 complex formed on intracellular Shigella.","['Suzuki T', 'Mimuro H', 'Miki H', 'Takenawa T', 'Sasaki T', 'Nakanishi H', 'Takai Y', 'Sasakawa C']",2000,191,11,J Exp Med,"Suzuki T, et al.

In total, 422 cases of shigellosis, aged 1 month to 14 y (238M, 184F) were hospitalized during the study period. The annual distribution was approximately stable until 1990, the mean number of cases per year being about 20. During the last 4 y the incidence significantly decreased. Shigella was serotyped in 138/422 cases. Seventy six of the strains were S. flexneri (55%) and 56 S. sonnei (40%). In the majority of cases the clinical picture was mild. Severe dehydration was seen in only 6 patients. Ninety four patients (22%) had extra-intestinal manifestations. Most common of these were convulsions (16%) and, less frequently, disturbances of consciousness (n = 26), rash (n = 9), shock and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (n = 2), nerve paralysis (n = 2), severe anaemia (n = 2) and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (n = 1). Nine patients had acute encephalopathy of 12 h to 12 d duration. It is important to note that all these cases recovered completely with no residual neurological deficit, except for 1 girl who developed temporal epilepsy 8 y later. Spinal fluid was normal in all 42 examined patients. Antibiotics were given to 212 of 422 patients, mainly during the first half of the study period. Shigella resistance to antibiotic was significant for cotrimoxazole (24%) and ampicillin (16%). All patients were cured. Shigellosis is a mild disease in our area, with a decreasing prevalence.","['Kavaliotis J', 'Karyda S', 'Konstantoula T', 'Kansouzidou A', 'Tsagaropoulou H']",2000,32,2,Scand J Infect Dis,"Kavaliotis J, et al.

10826712,Fate of Shigella sonnei on parsley and methods of disinfection.,"Outbreaks of shigellosis associated with chopped parsley used as a garnish for foods occurred in four states in the United States and in two Canadian provinces in 1998. This prompted a study to determine survival and growth characteristics of Shigella sonnei inoculated onto raw parsley. Two inoculum levels (approximately 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/g) were applied to parsley leaves, portions of which were then chopped. Inoculated whole and chopped parsley leaves were held at 4 degrees C or 21 degrees C for up to 14 days. Initial populations of the organism on chopped parsley receiving high or low levels of inoculum increased by approximately 3 log10 CFU/g, within 1 day at 21 degrees C. Populations of S. sonnei on inoculated chopped or whole parsley leaves held at 4 degrees C decreased by 2.5 to 3.0 log10 CFU/g during a 14-day storage period. The pathogen multiplied, without a lag phase, on inoculated (2.72 log10 CFU/g) chopped parsley held at 21 degrees C, exceeding 6 log10 CFU/g within 24 h. Treatment of inoculated whole parsley leaves with vinegar containing 5.2% (vol/vol) acetic acid or 200 ppm free chlorine for 5 min at 21 degrees C reduced the population of S. sonnei by more than 6 log10 CFU/g, whereas treatment with vinegar containing 7.6% acetic acid or 250 ppm free chlorine reduced initial populations of 7.07 and 7.26 log10 CFU/g, respectively, to undetectable levels (<0.6 log10 CFU/g). These studies revealed that S. sonnei can grow rapidly on chopped parsley held at ambient temperature and remain viable for at least 14 days at 4 degrees C. Treatment of contaminated parsley with vinegar or chlorinated water offers a simple method to reduce markedly or eliminate the pathogen in food-service or home settings.","['Wu FM', 'Doyle MP', 'Beuchat LR', 'Wells JG', 'Mintz ED', 'Swaminathan B']",2000,63,5,J Food Prot,"Wu FM, et al.

10816520,Innate immune responses in children and adults with Shigellosis.,"An array of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators of the innate immune system was analyzed in stool, urine, and rectal mucosa samples from adults and children with shigellosis to better understand their role in recovery from and in the immunopathogenesis of the disease. Increased concentrations of lactoferrin (Lf), myeloperoxidase (MPO), prostaglandin E(2), and leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) in stool during acute shigellosis in both children and adults indicated that activated cells of the innate defense system at the mucosal site were secreting the mediators. Increased concentration of MPO and 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) and lower levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in stool during acute Shigella infection suggested increased formation of reactive oxygen species, free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of membrane lipids, and decreased scavenging of the reactive oxygen radicals. In children, lower expression of SOD in tissue with severe inflammation and lower levels of SOD activity in stool for longer periods compared to adults may further worsen the tissue damage and predispose the children to a lowered defense. Both adult and pediatric patients had significantly higher expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the rectum with severe inflammation, compared to that seen with mild inflammation, accompanied by persistently up-regulated iNOS mRNA, reflecting increased production of nitric oxide at the local site. However, in contrast to adults, reduced urinary nitrate levels in pediatric patients during acute shigellosis suggested lower production of nitric oxide in the renal compartment. Persistent production of Lf in pediatric patients may contribute to chronic inflammation in the rectum. In addition, increased production of proinflammatory mediators in the rectum of patients with severe histology suggested contribution of these molecules to the immunopathogenesis of severe colitis caused by shigellae.","['Raqib R', 'Mia SM', 'Qadri F', 'Alam TI', 'Alam NH', 'Chowdhury AK', 'Mathan MM', 'Andersson J']",2000,68,6,Infect Immun,"Raqib R, et al.

To elucidate the mechanisms involved, we developed an animal model and demonstrated that TNF alpha and IL-1 beta play a role.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether TNF alpha and IL-1 beta genes are expressed in the brain following peripheral administration of Shigella dysenteriae 60R.
METHODS: Expression of mRNA for TNF alpha and IL-1 beta was examined in the brain structures (hypothalamus and hippocampus) and peripheral organs by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, at different time points after intraperitoneal injection of S. dysenteriae sonicate.
RESULTS: In our animal model of Shigella-related seizures, TNF alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA were induced in the brain, spleen and liver already 1 hour after injection of S. dysenteriae sonicate. The expression of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA in spleen, hippocampus and hypothalamus decreased after 6 h and increased again at 18 h post-injection.
CONCLUSIONS: Local production of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta in the brain may be involved in the enhanced seizure response of mice after administration of S. dysenteriae. It is possible that intracerebral production of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta plays a role in neurological disturbances of human shigellosis.","['Nofech-Mozes Y', 'Yuhas Y', 'Kaminsky E', 'Weizman A', 'Ashkenazi S']",2000,2,2,Isr Med Assoc J,"Nofech-Mozes Y, et al.

Rodents that express HLA-B27 develop spondyloarthropathies, implicating HLA-B27 in the etiology of these disorders. To determine whether an HLA-B27-like molecule was associated with spondyloarthropathies in nonhuman primates, we analyzed the MHC class I cDNAs expressed in a cohort of rhesus macaques that developed reactive arthritis after an outbreak of shigellosis. We identified several cDNAs with only limited sequence similarity to HLA-B27. Interestingly, one of these MHC molecules had a B pocket identical to that of HLA-B39. Pool sequencing of radiolabeled peptides bound by this molecule demonstrated that, like HLA-B27 and HLA-B39, it could bind peptides with arginine at the second position. However, extensive analysis of the MHC class I molecules in this cohort revealed no statistically significant association between any particular MHC class I allele and susceptibility to reactive arthritis. Furthermore, none of the rhesus MHC class I molecules bore a strong resemblance to HLA-B27, indicating that reactive arthritis can develop in this animal model in the absence of an HLA-B27-like molecule. Surprisingly, there was a statistically significant association between the rhesus macaque MHC A locus allele, Mamu-A*12, and the absence of reactive arthritis following Shigella infection.","['Urvater JA', 'McAdam SN', 'Loehrke JH', 'Allen TM', 'Moran JL', 'Rowell TJ', 'Rojo S', 'López de Castro JA', 'Taurog JD', 'Watkins DI']",2000,51,4-5,Immunogenetics,"Urvater JA, et al.

10791468,Prevalence of Brachyspira species isolated from diarrhoeic pigs in Brazil.,"Pathogenic intestinal spirochaetes of pigs include Brachyspira (formerly Serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine dysentery, and Brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of porcine colonic spirochetosis (PCS). The purpose of this study was to assess the relative importance of Brachyspira species in diarrhoeal disease of growing pigs on farms in southern Brazil. The intensity and pattern of haemolysis, the production of indole and the hydrolysis of hippurate by reference and field porcine intestinal spirochaetes were compared with 16S-ribosomal RNA (mRNA)- and 23S-rRNA-based polymerase chain reaction assays for the identification of B hyodysenteriae and B pilosicoli. Between July and October 1998, 206 rectal swabs were taken from pigs on 17 farms with a history of diarrhoea developing within 30 days after they had been moved from nursery to growing facilities. Of 49 beta-haemolytic spirochaetes that were cultured, 29 (59.2 per cent) were grown in pure culture for phenotypic and genotypic characterisation, leaving 20 untyped. Of the 29 typed isolates, eight isolates obtained from six farms were identified as B hyodysenteriae, and 15 isolates obtained from seven other farms were identified as B pilosicoli; the remaining six isolates were identified as weakly beta-haemolytic commensal spirochaetes.

Sequence analysis showed that sigA encodes a 139.6-kDa protein which belongs to the SPATE (serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae) subfamily of autotransporter proteins. The demonstration that SigA is autonomously secreted from the cell to yield a 103-kDa processed form and possesses a conserved C-terminal domain for export from the cell were consistent with the autotransporter pathway of secretion. Functional analysis showed that SigA is a secreted temperature-regulated serine protease capable of degrading casein. SigA was cytopathic for HEp-2 cells, suggesting that it may be a cell-altering toxin with a role in the pathogenesis of Shigella infections. SigA was at least partly responsible for the ability of S. flexneri to stimulate fluid accumulation in ligated rabbit ileal loops.","['Al-Hasani K', 'Henderson IR', 'Sakellaris H', 'Rajakumar K', 'Grant T', 'Nataro JP', 'Robins-Browne R', 'Adler B']",2000,68,5,Infect Immun,"Al-Hasani K, et al.

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Eighteen neighbouring villages in rural Gizan, southwestern Saudi Arabia.
SUBJECTS: Two hundred and thirty three cases of BD were identified among seventy nine families.
RESULTS: Secondary cases of BD occurred in 57 of 79 families with a primary case of BD. The secondary attack rate per cent (AR%) within families ranged between 7.7% and 80%. Age of primary cases did not correlate with degree of secondary AR% in exposed families (p > 0.04; p > 0.05); however, within households, the age of the first secondary cases (median = two years) was usually less than the age of the primary case (median = six years). Children under five years of age constituted 43% of secondary cases. The median interval between successive cases within a house ranged from three and seven days. Two hundred and twenty cases (94.4%) gave history of close contact within another case of BD. Cases of BD were exposed to close relatives with BD (79.1%), neighbours (11.4%), and friends (9.5%). Risk factors influencing the spread of BD within families included two rooms or fewer per house (OR = 4.3, 9.5% CI 1.3-14.3), family size of five or more (p = 0.012, two-tailed Fisher's exact test), and presence of more than two persons per room (OR = 11.2, 95% CI 3.1-42.4).
CONCLUSION: Person-to-person secondary transmission can amplify the spread of bacillary dysentery within households and neighbouring villages. Crowding was a risk factor that amplified transmission of BD within families.","['el Bushra HE', 'Bin Saeed AA']",1999,76,5,East Afr Med J,el Bushra HE and Bin Saeed AA.

10722437,Emergence of antimicrobial-resistant shigellosis in Oregon.,"Ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) are currently considered acceptable empirical therapy for shigellosis in developed countries. However, there are few recently reported studies on antimicrobial resistance among shigellae isolated in the United States. We examined the epidemiology of shigellosis and the antimicrobial susceptibility of Shigella species isolated in Oregon from July 1995 through June 1998. Of 430 isolates, 410 were identified to the species level: Shigella sonnei accounted for 55% of isolates, and Shigella flexneri, for 40%. The overall annual incidence of shigellosis was 4.4 cases per 100,000 population. Children aged <5 years (annual incidence, 19.6 cases per 100,000 population) and Hispanics (annual incidence, 28.4 cases per 100,000 population) were at highest risk. Of 369 isolates tested, 59% were resistant to TMP-SMZ, 63% were resistant to ampicillin, 1% were resistant to cefixime, and 0.3% were resistant to nalidixic acid; none of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Thirteen percent of the isolates had multidrug resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Infections due to multidrug-resistant shigellae are endemic in Oregon. Neither ampicillin nor TMP-SMZ should be considered appropriate empirical therapy for shigellosis any longer; when antibiotics are indicated, a quinolone or cefixime should be used.","['Replogle ML', 'Fleming DW', 'Cieslak PR']",2000,30,3,Clin Infect Dis,"Replogle ML, et al.

10700227,A new biological agent for treatment of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli infections and dysentery in humans.,"Gastrointestinal disease caused by Shiga toxin-producing bacteria (such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Shigella dysenteriae) is often complicated by life-threatening toxin-induced systemic sequelae, including hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Such infections can now be diagnosed very early in the course of the disease, but at present no effective therapeutic intervention is possible. Here, we constructed a recombinant bacterium that displayed a Shiga toxin receptor mimic on its surface, and it adsorbed and neutralized Shiga toxins with very high efficiency. Moreover, oral administration of the recombinant bacterium completely protected mice from challenge with an otherwise 100%-fatal dose of Shiga toxigenic E. coli. Thus, the bacterium shows great promise as a 'probiotic' treatment for Shiga toxigenic E. coli infections and dysentery.","['Paton AW', 'Morona R', 'Paton JC']",2000,6,3,Nat Med,"Paton AW, et al.

10689233,Etiology of travelers' diarrhea on a Caribbean island.,"BACKGROUND: Between December 6, 1994 and March 10, 1996, a study of the etiology of diarrhea was carried out among 332 travelers to five all-inclusive hotels in Negril, Jamaica.
METHODS: Stool specimens were collected and sent to Montego Bay for laboratory analysis. Escherichia coli strains isolated at the Jamaican laboratory were sent to Houston for toxin testing.
RESULTS: A recognized enteropathogen was found in 118 of the 332 (35.5%) cases. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were the most commonly identified pathogen (87/332; 26.2%) followed by Salmonella (4.2%) and Shigella (4.2%). Clustering of etiologically defined cases was studied at each hotel. A cluster was defined as 2 or more cases with the same pathogen identified in the same hotel within 7 days. In the 3 hotels with the highest number of cases of diarrhea, enteropathogens were part of a cluster in 65 of 99 cases (65.7%) of diarrhea of which an etiologic agent was identified. In the other 2 hotels, only 4 of 20 cases (20%) occurred in clusters.
CONCLUSIONS: A total of 25 clusters of travelers' diarrhea cases was detected at the five hotels during the study period. Seventeen of 25 (68%) ETEC isolations occurred as part of a clustering of diarrhea cases. The largest outbreak of pathogen-identified diarrhea consisted of 7 cases of ETEC producing both heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxins. In the Jamaican hotels with all inclusive meal packages most diarrhea cases occurred as small clusters, presumably as the result of foodborne outbreaks.","['Paredes P', 'Campbell-Forrester S', 'Mathewson JJ', 'Ashley D', 'Thompson S', 'Steffen R', 'Jiang ZD', 'Svennerholm AM', 'DuPont HL']",2000,7,1,J Travel Med,"Paredes P, et al.

In stepwise fashion, four separate groups were given 3 x 10(2), 7 x 10(3), 5 x 10(4), or 7 x 10(5) CFU. Using PBMC, proliferative responses and cytokine production were measured to S. dysenteriae whole-cell preparations and to purified recombinant invasion plasmid Ags (Ipa) C and IpaD. Anti-LPS and anti-Ipa Abs and Ab-secreting cells were also evaluated. Preinoculation PBMC produced considerable quantities of IL-10 and IFN-gamma, probably secreted by monocytes and NK cells, respectively, of the innate immune system. Following inoculation, PBMC from 95 and 87% of volunteers exhibited an increased production of IFN-gamma and IL-10, respectively, in response to Shigella Ags. These increases included responses to IpaC and IpaD among those volunteers receiving the lowest inoculum. No IL-4 or IL-5 responses were detected. Whereas there were no Ab or Ab-secreting cell responses in volunteers receiving the lowest inoculum, other dose groups had moderate to strong anti-LPS and anti-Ipa responses. These results suggest that in humans, type 1 responses play an important role in mucosal and systemic immunity to S. dysentariae 1.","['Samandari T', 'Kotloff KL', 'Losonsky GA', 'Picking WD', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Levine MM', 'Sztein MB']",2000,164,4,J Immunol,"Samandari T, et al.

10640609,Effect of erythromycin on Shigella infection of Caco-2 cells.,"Erythromycin (EM), one of the macrolides, shows a dose-dependent effect on Shigella flexneri invasion of Caco-2 cells even at concentrations less than the minimum inhibitory concentration (subMIC). LS13, a strain of S. flexneri 1b, invaded Caco-2 cells in vitro. When the strain was treated with subMIC of EM, the invasion efficiency decreased. The carrier rate of the invasion plasmid containing virulence genes was reduced by EM treatment, as determined by the colony pigmentation test on Congo red agar plates. Presence of the invasion plasmid was found to increase susceptibility of the organisms to EM. The growth of virulent organisms carrying the invasion plasmid was inhibited at 25 microg ml(-1) of EM, whereas the growth of organisms without the plasmid was inhibited at 100 microg ml(-1) of EM. This was supported by the finding that the MIC of EM for a virulent isolate of S. flexneri 2a YSH6000 (6.25 microg ml(-1)) and for the mutant strain del-17 (50 microg ml(-1)), carrying the type III apparatus, impaired plasmid. These findings suggested that EM passed through the type III apparatus and suppressed the growth of invasive organisms selectively. This mechanism may account for the clinical effect of EM on shigellosis.","['Honma Y', 'Sasakawa C', 'Tsuji T', 'Iwanaga M']",2000,27,2,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,"Honma Y, et al.

RESULTS: PMNL population proved functionally heterogeneic, correlating with acute dysentery severity. Subgroups of PMNL varied by CL amplitude, reserve ability to additional stimulation. LPS rather modulated CL of PMNL than stimulated it. CL intensity depended on LPS structure and concentration.

10591626,Src tyrosine kinase activity down-regulates Rho-dependent responses during Shigella entry into epithelial cells and stress fibre formation.,"Invasion of epithelial cells by Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, is dependent upon the formation of characteristic membrane ruffles that engulf the bacteria in a macropinocytic-like process. We show here that Cdc42 and Rac GTPases, but not Rho;, are critical for actin polymerisation, whereas Rho; is necessary for the recruitment of ezrin and Src at the site of entry. Remarkably, cells expressing constitutively active Src did not show ezrin recruitment at Shigella entry foci. In these cells, formation of stress fibres induced by LPA stimulation, or microinjection of activated Rho; (V14Rho), was inhibited. Src-mediated tyrosyl-phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP correlated with changes in the ability of p190RhoGAP to interact with Rho;, suggesting that Src regulates Rho; function via p190RhoGAP. We propose that Rho; activation is required for proper organisation of Shigella entry foci and for Src recruitment, and that Src tyrosine kinase activity, in turn, down-regulates the function of Rho; at the site of Shigella entry.

10586144,Use of quantitative microbial risk assessment for evaluation of the benefits of laundry sanitation.,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the risk assessment process for quantifying the contribution of contamination in the home to microbial infections. Whereas risks of enteric pathogens spread through food has been assessed, the spread of fecal-oral pathogens through surfaces likely at low rates would be difficult to address through epidemiologic studies. An alternative is quantitative risk assessment. The 4-step process of hazard identification, dose-response, exposure assessment, and risk characterization can be used; however, exposure assessment may follow a complicated pathway consisting of survival and transference. Microbial hazards in the home have focused primarily on enteric bacteria. Dose-response data are available; however, the transfer from the hands to the dose is uncertain. Through day care studies, Shigella has been shown to be transferred in this manner, and a dose-response model is available. By using these data and information on the transference of bacteria between clothing and hands, risk estimates were made for contaminated laundry. Risks were calculated as high as 10 per million population to much lower levels associated with lower excretion rates of the bacteria in the feces. Approximately a 90% and 99% reduction in the probability of disease through laundering and use of a sanitizing detergent, respectively, were suggested by the models. Better data are needed on incidence of disease in the population, excretion rates over the course of an infection, amount of feces spread in the home, distribution of bacteria, survival, and the transfer of the bacteria from surfaces to the hands and to the mouth.","['Gibson LL', 'Rose JB', 'Haas CN']",1999,27,6,Am J Infect Control,"Gibson LL, et al.

To examine the in vivo role of the most recently discovered member of the IkappaB family, IkappaBepsilon, we generated a null allele of the murine IkappaBepsilon gene by replacement of all coding sequences with nlslacZ. Unlike IkappaBalpha nullizygous mice, mice lacking IkappaBepsilon are viable, fertile, and indistinguishable from wild-type animals in appearance and histology. Analysis of beta-galactosidase expression pattern revealed that IkappaBepsilon is mainly expressed in T cells in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. Flow cytometric analysis of immune cell populations from the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes did not show any specific differences between the wild-type and the mutant mice, with the exception of a reproducible 50% reduction of the CD44-CD25+ T cell subspecies. The IkappaBepsilon-null mice present constitutive up-regulation of IgM and IgG1 Ig isotypes together with a further increased synthesis of these two isotypes after immunization against T cell-dependent or independent Ags. The failure of observable augmentation of constitutive nuclear NF-kappaB/Rel-binding activity is probably due to compensatory mechanisms involving IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta, which are up-regulated in several organs. RNase-mapping analysis indicated that IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1Ra, and IL-6 mRNA levels are constitutively elevated in thioglycolate-elicited IkappaBepsilon-null macrophages in contrast to GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IFN-gamma, which remain undetectable.","['Mémet S', 'Laouini D', 'Epinat JC', 'Whiteside ST', 'Goudeau B', 'Philpott D', 'Kayal S', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Berche P', 'Kanellopoulos J', 'Israël A']",1999,163,11,J Immunol,"Mémet S, et al.

10569751,Role of nitric oxide in the enhancement of pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures caused by Shigella dysenteriae.,"Convulsions and encephalopathy are frequent complications of childhood shigellosis. We studied the role of nitric oxide (NO) in Shigella-related seizures in an animal model. Pretreatment of mice with Shigella dysenteriae 60R sonicate elevated serum NO levels and enhanced the convulsive response to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), as indicated by a higher mean convulsion score and a higher number of mice responding with seizures. Treatment of the mice with S-methylisothiourea sulfate (SMT), a potent inhibitor of inducible NO synthase (NOS), prevented the elevation of serum NO levels and concomitantly reduced the enhanced response to PTZ. The mean convulsion scores were 0.7, 0.7, 1.3, and 0.8 for mice treated with saline, saline and SMT, S. dysenteriae 60R sonicate, and S. dysenteriae 60R sonicate with SMT, respectively (P = 0.001 for 60R sonicate versus saline and P = 0.013 for 60R sonicate versus 60R sonicate with SMT). The corresponding seizure rates were 40, 44, 75, and 47% for saline, saline with SMT, S. dysenteriae 60R sonicate, and S. dysenteriae 60R sonicate with SMT, respectively (P = 0.0004 for 60R sonicate versus saline and P = 0.005 for 60R sonicate versus 60R sonicate with SMT). In contrast, injection of N-nitro-L-arginine, a selective inhibitor of constitutive NOS, neither abolished the elevation of serum NO nor attenuated the enhancement of seizures. These findings indicate that NO, induced by S. dysenteriae 60R sonicate, is involved in enhancing the susceptibility to seizures caused by S. dysenteriae.","['Balter-Seri J', 'Yuhas Y', 'Weizman A', 'Nofech-Mozes Y', 'Kaminsky E', 'Ashkenazi S']",1999,67,12,Infect Immun,"Balter-Seri J, et al.

10562807,"A survey of infections in United Kingdom laboratories, 1994-1995.","AIMS: To identify the number and type of infections occurring in United Kingdom clinical laboratories during 1994 and 1995, following similar surveys covering 1970 to 1989.
METHODS: A retrospective questionnaire survey was undertaken of 397 responding UK clinical laboratories covering 1994 and 1995. A follow up telephone survey was undertaken with each of the laboratories from which a questionnaire had been received indicating a possible or probable laboratory acquired infection during 1994 or 1995.
RESULTS: Questionnaires were sent to 659 laboratories or organisations which were thought to have laboratories, of which 557 responded (response rate of 84.5%). Of these, only 397 were from organisations with laboratories. Over 55,000 person-years of occupational exposure were covered, and only nine cases identified, giving an infection incidence rate overall of 16.2/100,000 person-years, compared with 82.7 infections/100,000 person-years found in a similar survey covering 1988 and 1989, reported previously. Infections were commonest in females, in relatively young staff, in microbiology laboratory workers, and in scientific/technical employees. Gastrointestinal infections predominated, particularly shigellosis, but few specific aetiological factors relating to working practices were identified. No hepatitis B cases were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The small number of cases identified indicates high standards of infection control, though there is still room for improvement.

10545097,Binding of the Shigella protein IpaA to vinculin induces F-actin depolymerization.,"Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, enters into epithelial cells by a macropinocytic process. IpaA, a Shigella protein secreted upon cell contact, binds to the focal adhesion protein vinculin and is required for efficient bacterial uptake. IpaA was shown here to bind with high affinity to the N-terminal residues 1-265 of vinculin. Using co-sedimentation and solid-phase assays, we demonstrated that binding of IpaA to vinculin strongly increases the association of vinculin with F-actin. We also characterized a depolymerizing activity on actin filaments associated with the vinculin-IpaA complex both in vitro and in microinjected cells. We propose that the conformational change of vinculin induced by IpaA binding allows interaction of the vinculin-IpaA complex with F-actin and subsequent depolymerization of actin filaments.","['Bourdet-Sicard R', 'Rüdiger M', 'Jockusch BM', 'Gounon P', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Nhieu GT']",1999,18,21,EMBO J,"Bourdet-Sicard R, et al.

By RAPD analysis with 2 kinds of primers specific for Shigella, every 6 isolates showed the same pattern. But the DNA fingerprint analysis by PFGE that was performed according to 2 standardized restriction endonucleases revealed a discriminative pattern. However, the resemblance of all isolates, which was calculated by the UPGMA methods, was 0.90 or higher. In the second case (case B), all of the 14 isolates were the colicin 6 type and sensitive to 16 drugs. The serotype of 13 isolates was phase I. The 11 isolates have plasmids of 230 kb and 3 kb. The resemblance of all isolates, which was calculated by the UPGMA methods, was 0.89 or higher.

10531267,Increased interleukin-1 (IL-1) and imbalance between IL-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist during acute inflammation in experimental Shigellosis.,"Infection by the enteric bacterial pathogen Shigella results in intense mucosal inflammation and destruction of the colonic and rectal epithelium in infected humans. Initial bacterial translocation occurs through the follicle-associated epithelium. Previous experiments suggest that interleukin-1 (IL-1) is crucial to trigger inflammation, particularly in the follicular zones. During the first 4 hours of infection in a rabbit ligated-loop model of intestinal invasion, there are two salient characteristics: (i) a high concentration of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, both in infected Peyer's patch tissue and in the corresponding efferent mesenteric blood, and (ii) a very low level of expression of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). These may reflect a combination of regulation of expression and secretion of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1ra by both resident and recruited phagocytes and the induction of mononuclear phagocyte apoptosis by Shigella. This low IL-1ra/IL-1 ratio likely accounts for the rapid, uncontrolled inflammation characteristic of shigellosis.","['Arondel J', 'Singer M', 'Matsukawa A', 'Zychlinsky A', 'Sansonetti PJ']",1999,67,11,Infect Immun,"Arondel J, et al.

10523561,Prevalence of Shigella enterotoxins 1 and 2 among Shigella strains isolated from patients with traveler's diarrhea.,"Shigella spp. are known primarily as a cause of bacillary dysentery. However, in an initial phase, numerous patients exhibit watery diarrhea that may or may not be followed by dysentery. New virulence factors associated with the species of Shigella have recently been described. These are enterotoxins 1 and 2 of Shigella (ShET-1 and ShET-2, respectively). The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of ShET-1 and ShET-2 in species of Shigella isolated from patients with traveler's diarrhea. During the period from 1993 to 1998, stool samples from 500 travelers with diarrhea were cultured for the isolation of Shigella spp. and other enteropathogens. The detection of ShET-1 and ShET-2 was performed by a PCR technique with specific primers. Among a total of 51 strains of Shigella isolated during this period (22 S. flexneri, 26 S. sonnei, and 3 S. dysenteriae strains), at least one enterotoxin was detected in 31 (60.78%) strains; 2 (9.09%; both of which were S. flexneri strains) produced only ShET-1, while 21 (41.17%; 3 S. flexneri, 15 S. sonnei, and 3 S. dysenteriae strains) produced ShET-2. Furthermore, 8 (15.69%) of 22 S. flexneri strains presented both enterotoxins. Our results show that the prevalence of ShET-2 was high in all the Shigella species studied and confirm that ShET-1 is detected only in S. flexneri.","['Vargas M', 'Gascon J', 'Jimenez De Anta MT', 'Vila J']",1999,37,11,J Clin Microbiol,"Vargas M, et al.

10516787,Global burden of Shigella infections: implications for vaccine development and implementation of control strategies.,"Few studies provide data on the global morbidity and mortality caused by infection with Shigella spp.; such estimates are needed, however, to plan strategies of prevention and treatment. Here we report the results of a review of the literature published between 1966 and 1997 on Shigella infection. The data obtained permit calculation of the number of cases of Shigella infection and the associated mortality occurring worldwide each year, by age, and (as a proxy for disease severity) by clinical category, i.e. mild cases remaining at home, moderate cases requiring outpatient care, and severe cases demanding hospitalization. A sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the high and low range of morbid and fatal cases in each category. Finally, the frequency distribution of Shigella infection, by serogroup and serotype and by region of the world, was determined. The annual number of Shigella episodes throughout the world was estimated to be 164.7 million, of which 163.2 million were in developing countries (with 1.1 million deaths) and 1.5 million in industrialized countries. A total of 69% of all episodes and 61% of all deaths attributable to shigellosis involved children under 5 years of age. The median percentages of isolates of S. flexneri, S. sonnei, S. boydii, and S. dysenteriae were, respectively, 60%, 15%, 6%, and 6% (30% of S. dysenteriae cases were type 1) in developing countries; and 16%, 77%, 2%, and 1% in industrialized countries. In developing countries, the predominant serotype of S. flexneri is 2a, followed by 1b, 3a, 4a, and 6. In industrialized countries, most isolates are S. flexneri 2a or other unspecified type 2 strains. Shigellosis, which continues to have an important global impact, cannot be adequately controlled with the existing prevention and treatment measures. Innovative strategies, including development of vaccines against the most common serotypes, could provide substantial benefits.","['Kotloff KL', 'Winickoff JP', 'Ivanoff B', 'Clemens JD', 'Swerdlow DL', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Adak GK', 'Levine MM']",1999,77,8,Bull World Health Organ,"Kotloff KL, et al.

10512431,Epidemiology of rotavirus diarrhea in Egyptian children and implications for disease control.,"Reliable epidemiologic data are essential for formulating effective policy to control rotavirus disease through immunization. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of rotavirus diarrhea in a population-based cohort of children under 3 years of age residing in Abu Homos, Egypt, in 1995-1996. Rotavirus diarrhea incidence rates (episodes per person-year) were 0.13 for infants aged <6 months, 0.61 for those aged 6-11 months, 0.17 for those aged 12-23 months, and 0.15 for those aged 24-35 months. Fifty-six percent of children with rotavirus diarrhea had clinical dehydration; 90% of rotavirus diarrheal episodes occurred between July and November. In infants under 1 year of age, receipt of breast milk was associated with a lower incidence of rotavirus diarrhea. No other sociodemographic or environmental factor was found to be significantly associated with rotavirus diarrhea. Of 46 rotavirus isolates with strains identified, 41 (89%) were G serotypes 1 and 2. Rotavirus diarrhea was a major cause of morbidity in this cohort. Promotion of breastfeeding may exert a protective effect in young infants in this setting, but improvements in water and sanitation are unlikely to be effective preventive measures. The use of effective immunization against rotavirus in early infancy should be considered a public health priority.","['Naficy AB', 'Abu-Elyazeed R', 'Holmes JL', 'Rao MR', 'Savarino SJ', 'Kim Y', 'Wierzba TF', 'Peruski L', 'Lee YJ', 'Gentsch JR', 'Glass RI', 'Clemens JD']",1999,150,7,Am J Epidemiol,"Naficy AB, et al.

Recovery rate of Shigella has decreased from 0.28% (589 cases) in 1961 to 0.01% (9 cases) in 1969, and 7 cases between 1971 and 1975 and only 3 carriers since 1976 have been detected. On the other hand, Salmonella has been detected from about 9,000 cases (0.07%) during 18 years. The isolates were typed into 150 serovars, in which the most frequent one was S. Enteritidis, following S. Litchfield, S. Thompson, S. Hadar, S. Typhimurium, S. Infantis, S. Tennessee, S. Montevideo, S. Agona and S. Braenderup. These serovars except S.

10479961,[Outbreak of shigellosis in a lower-class district].,"BACKGROUND: The outbreaks of Shigella sonnei in our environment frequently involve day care centers and elementary schools. An outbreak of shigellosis in a lower-class district is reported. The purpose of this study is that of pinpointing the center of infection, the means of contagion, the characteristics of those infected and of assessing the suitability of the measures taken.
METHODS: For monitoring the outbreak over time, a combined observational timeline study was conducted within a territory the bounds of which were marked by means of the conventional epidemiological monitoring variables (time, place and individual). The infectivity of the center of infection (contagion rate) is analyzed by age, gender and school; rate ratio and percentage attributable thereto.
RESULTS: On a time-related basis, the outbreak in question started on week 46/97 and ended on week 8/98. This outbreak involved 218 individuals (110 males and 108 females) totaling 5.46% of the district. The highest frequency was found among the 0-4 age group (43.6%), 29.4% in day care (70.32% contagion rate) with a relative risk of 3.9 (95% CI: 2.57-5.93) and 74.36% attributable percentage. The rate ratio between day care and the schools in the district in question is 5.62 (95% CI: 4.33-7.31). Stool cultures were taken and analyzed in 84 cases (38.5%), Shigella sonnei being detected in 38 cases (17.4%). Antibacterial treatment (amoxicillin-clavulan) was set out and individual and group health and safety measures were employed.
CONCLUSIONS: The long communicability period and the small number of viable microorganisms necessary for causing this disease fostered its being passed on from one person to another at school and in the home. The measures employed effectively confined the contagion of the infectious agent at the schools.","['Chover Lara JL', 'Salazar Cifre A', 'Gallego Cruz M', 'Camaró Sala ML', 'Segarra Martínez C', 'Peñalver Blasco MC']",1999,73,3,Rev Esp Salud Publica,"Chover Lara JL, et al.

10462247,Quantitative analysis of IgG class and subclass and IgA serum response to Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri 2a polysaccharides following vaccination with Shigella conjugate vaccines.,"It has been recently reported that a conjugate vaccine composed of the O-specific polysaccharide of S. sonnei bound to Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant exoprotein A (rEPA) conferred 74% protection against S. sonnei shigellosis. In the present study affinity purified Shigella antibodies were used as standards to quantify and characterize the serum antibody response to vaccination with Shigella sonnei or Shigella flexneri 2a polysaccharide conjugated to rEPA. The geometric mean concentrations of antibodies at the pre-vaccination stage were 3.8 microg/ml for IgG anti-S. sonnei LPS and 11.26 microg/ml for IgG anti-S. flexneri 2a LPS. Vaccination with S. sonnei-rEPA and S. flexneri 2a-rEPA induced the production of specific IgG antibodies to levels of 115.8 microg/ml and 126.5 microg/ml, respectively. The levels of specific antibodies above the pre-vaccination values persisted for at least 2 years. The IgG response to S. flexneri 2a-rEPA conjugate was almost entirely represented by the IgG2 subclass. The concentration of IgG1 anti-S. sonnei LPS was significantly higher than that of IgG2 14 days after vaccination with the homologous conjugate, but decreased to similar levels to those of IgG2 6, 12 and 24 months after immunization. Since the only difference between the S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a conjugates lies in the different polysaccharides of the two Shigella serogroups (the protein rEPA, is identical in both cases), it follows that the different pattern of IgG subclass response is a result of the different structures of the two O-polysaccharides of S. sonnei and S. flexneri 2a.","['Robin G', 'Keisari Y', 'Slepon R', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Cohen D']",1999,17,23-24,Vaccine,"Robin G, et al.

The stability of the indigenous microflora were estimated by enumeration of total and gram-negative aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacterial species, specifically Lactobacilli, from coprocultures taken before and after maternal separation. In addition, behavioral and cortisol responses to separation were correlated to the microflora. A significant decrease in fecal bacteria, especially Lactobacilli, was evident on day 3 postseparation, with a return to baseline by the end of the week. The drop in the microflora was correlated with the display of stress-indicative behaviors, but not with cortisol secretion. In addition, infants who displayed numerous stress-indicative behaviors were more susceptible to opportunistic bacterial infection. These results suggest that strong emotional reactions to disruption of the mother-infant bond may increase vulnerability to disease.","['Bailey MT', 'Coe CL']",1999,35,2,Dev Psychobiol,Bailey MT and Coe CL.

10453122,Detection of Shigellae from stools of dysentery patients by culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques.,"In Bangladesh, the isolation rates of Shigella spp. range from 11% to 12% by the conventional culture technique. Since the sensitivity of this technique is low, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used for detecting small number of Shigellae from patients' stools. Sensitivity and specificity of the two techniques were also compared. Stool samples were collected from 41 patients with dysentery who attended the Clinical Research and Service Centre of the ICDDR,B: Centre for Health and Population Research. All stool specimens were directly plated onto MacConkey, Salmonella-Shigella, Xylose lysin deoxycholate and Hectoen enteric agar media, and Shigellae were detected following standard procedures. DNA was extracted from the stool samples, and the target sequence of invasive plasmid antigen (ipa)H locus was amplified by PCR with 130 ng each of two primers (primer H8 [5'-GTTCCTTGACCGCCTTTCCGATAC-3'] and primer H15 [5'-GCCGGTCAGCCACCCTA-3']) following standard procedures. The amplified product was hybridized using an ipaH probe. The isolation rates of Shigella dysenteriae type 1, S. flexneri, S. sonnei, and S. boydii were, respectively, 17.1%, 19.5%, 4.9% and 2.4% by the conventional method. The results of the PCR technique showed that 700 bp fragment was generated in 18 of the 18 culture-positive and in 7 of the 23 culture-negative stools. One hundred twenty-three strains of Escherichia coli were also tested by PCR for identifying the enteroinvasive E. coli, but none of them yielded any positive result. This study showed that the sensitivity of the culture technique is 72% and specificity is 100%, when the PCR technique was considered as gold standard. Therefore, the PCR may be considered a more sensitive and specific technique than the conventional culture technique and has the potential to be employed in routine diagnosis of dysentery in clinical centres as well as in epidemiologic studies.","['Islam MS', 'Hossain MS', 'Hasan MK', 'Rahman MM', 'Fuchs G', 'Mahalanabis D', 'Baqui AH', 'Albert MJ']",1998,16,4,J Diarrhoeal Dis Res,"Islam MS, et al.

The proportion of patients with persistent bloody diarrhoea was 51.0% at treatment day 3 and 27.9% at treatment day 5. At discharge, 79.9% had improved or were cured. The case fatality ratio was 13.2%, higher for patients treated with nalidixic acid than for those treated with ciprofloxacin (12.2% vs. 2.2%, RR = 5.80, 95% CI = 0.83-40.72). In a logistic regression model three risk factors were significantly associated with an increased risk of death during hospitalization: severe dehydration on admission (adjusted OR = 2.79, 95% CI = 1.46-5.33), age over 50 (adjusted OR vs. 5-49 age group = 3.22, 95% CI = 1.70-6.11) and prescription of nalidixic acid (adjusted OR vs. ciprofloxacin = 8.66, 95% CI = 1.08-69.67). Those results were consistent with reported high levels of resistance of Sd1 to the commonest antibiotics, including nalidixic acid. Patients belonging to groups with a higher risk of dying should be given special medical attention and supportive care. In areas of high resistance to nalidixic acid, severe cases of dysentery should be treated with fluoroquinolones in order to reduce the mortality associated with these epidemics.","['Legros D', 'Paquet C', 'Dorlencourt F', 'Saoult E']",1999,4,6,Trop Med Int Health,"Legros D, et al.

Fourteen patients were male and six were female. Shigella B was found in 85% and Shigella D in 15% of cases. The major indications for admission were convulsions and dehydration. Fifteen per cent of cases had underlying malignancies and 42.1% had malnutrition. Most patients had a peak of fever between 39.5 and 40.5 degrees C, serum sodium between 128-144 mEq/l. Mild acidosis was detected in 45% and moderate acidosis in 30% of cases. There were no statistical differences in peak of fever and serum sodium between patients who had convulsion and who did not. Shigellemia was found in one case who also had underlying neuroblastoma. One patient died due to necrotizing enterocolitis, septic shock and renal failure. Most of the organisms found resisted to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). However, TMP-SMX was prescribed in most immunocompetent patients and they recovered well. All of three patients with underlying malignancy responded well to ceftriaxone.","['Sirivichayakul C', 'Thisyakorn U']",1998,29,3,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,Sirivichayakul C and Thisyakorn U.

10422319,[Acute infectious diarrheal disease in Romania: 1993-1998].,"The decrease of morbidity-mortality caused by gastroenteritis is in relation to the factors largely responsible for the fall in infant mortality and mortality from communicable diseases in developing countries. Nevertheless, diarrhea is still a considerable public health problem in these countries, especially among children under 5 years old. 98% of all deaths in children younger than 15 years are in the developing world. Five of the ten leading killers are communicable, perinatal, and nutritional disorders largely affecting children. The knowledge of the etiology and epidemiology of childhood diarrhea in a given area is needed to plan any measure designed to prevent or ameliorate diarrheal illness and to develop practical guidelines for the most appropriate examination procedures. In Romania, although the real data of morbidity by acute diarrhea are not known, the reports show a significant decrease in the past 10 years. In 1993, 420.2 cases at 100,000 inhabitants were reported, the most commonly affected being the children age 0-4 years. The incidence decreased to 338.5 cases at 100,000 inhabitants in 1997 (and a quite similar incidence for the first 11 month of 1998). Between 1993-1998, 527,977 cases were reported (58.1% in urban area), with a higher frequency in spring-autumn season. Antibiotics are not required in case of acute diarrhea with little or no fever. Antibiotics could be discussed for cholera-like diarrhea and are required in case of invasive bacterial diarrhea, shigellosis, cholera, and Clostridium difficile as well as diarrhea with fever and sanguinolent stools in infants or salmonella-induced diarrhea with signs of extradigestive complications. Importance of oral rehydration solution in the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases is well known. It can be applied to all types of diarrhoea, practically, without any side effects, complications, such aas hypernatraemia is avoidable. It has proved to be effective for dehydration caused by diarrhoea and for diarrhoea, too. There is a need for effective infection control policies, which include appropriate training of staff; simple surveillance systems and readily available expert advice to ensure that outbreaks are rapidly controlled. Approaches to prevention include education about risk factors, which often fails to lead to modification of risky behavior. Further regional epidemiological studies are necessary to develop more appropriate management guidelines.","['Popa MI', 'Piţigoi D', 'Ciufecu C', 'Popa L']",1998,43,4,Bacteriol Virusol Parazitol Epidemiol,"Popa MI, et al.

Despite the absence of severe intestinal and metabolic derangement, Shigella was cultured from the stool. Toxic encephalopathy is responsible for death following this rare complication of childhood shigellosis in developed countries. The pathophysiology is unknown.
CONCLUSION: Lethal toxic encephalopathy can be caused by Shigella despite the absence of severe intestinal and metabolic derangement. If shigelllosis is suspected, headache may be a first significant sign for the development of toxic encephalopathy. Early recognition and rapid measures to prevent brain oedema may improve outcome.","['Plötz FB', 'Arets HG', 'Fleer A', 'Gemke RJ']",1999,158,7,Eur J Pediatr,"Plötz FB, et al.

Barzu, A. Fontaine, P. J. Sansonetti, and A. Phalipon, Infect. Immun. 64:1190-1196, 1996). Dose selection studies showed that SC602 causes shigellosis in a majority of volunteers when 3 x 10(8) or 2 x 10(6) CFU are ingested. In contrast, a dose of 10(4) CFU was associated with transient fever or mild diarrhea in 2 of 15 volunteers. All volunteers receiving single doses of >/=10(4) CFU excreted S. flexneri 2a, and this colonization induced significant antibody-secreting cell and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay responses against S. flexneri 2a lipopolysaccharide in two-thirds of the vaccinees. Seven volunteers who had been vaccinated 8 weeks earlier with a single dose of 10(4) CFU and 7 control subjects were challenged with 2 x 10(3) CFU of virulent S. flexneri 2a organisms. Six of the control volunteers developed shigellosis with fever and severe diarrhea or dysentery, while none of the vaccinees had fever, dysentery, or severe symptoms (P = 0. 005). Three vaccinees experienced mild diarrhea, and these subjects had lower antibody titers than did the fully protected volunteers. Although the apparent window of safety is narrow, SC602 is the first example of an attenuated S. flexneri 2a candidate vaccine that provides protection against shigellosis in a stringent, human challenge model.","['Coster TS', 'Hoge CW', 'VanDeVerg LL', 'Hartman AB', 'Oaks EV', 'Venkatesan MM', 'Cohen D', 'Robin G', 'Fontaine-Thompson A', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Hale TL']",1999,67,7,Infect Immun,"Coster TS, et al.

10362536,A functional role for ezrin during Shigella flexneri entry into epithelial cells.,"Shigella flexneri is an enteroinvasive bacterium responsible for bacillary dysentery in humans. Bacterial entry into epithelial cells is a crucial step for the establishment of the infection. It is characterized by a transient reorganization of the host cell cytoskeleton at the site of bacterial interaction with the cell membrane, which leads to bacterial engulfment by a macropinocytic process. We show in this study that the membrane-cytoskeleton linker, ezrin, a member of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family, plays an active role in the process of Shigella uptake. Ezrin is highly enriched in cellular protrusions induced by the bacterium and is found in close association with the plasma membrane. In addition, Shigella entry is significantly reduced in cells transfected with a dominant negative allele of ezrin with entry foci showing much shorter cellular protrusions. These results indicate that ezrin not only acts as a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, but may also mediate extension of cellular projections in the presence of signals such as those elicited by invading microorganisms.","['Skoudy A', 'Nhieu GT', 'Mantis N', 'Arpin M', 'Mounier J', 'Gounon P', 'Sansonetti P']",1999,112 ( Pt 13),,J Cell Sci,"Skoudy A, et al.

10349160,[Antimicrobial multiresistance of Shigella sp strains in a semi rural community of northern Santiago].,"UNLABELLED: Appropriate antimicrobial therapy shortens the duration of Shigellosis and significantly reduces the risk of transmission. Shigella strains resistant to common antimicrobials have increased during the past years, determining the need for a periodic surveillance, to guide effective therapy.
AIM: To report the results of a surveillance program in a rural community near Santiago (Colina), for Shigella infections.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 1997, stool samples from 3,534 episodes of diarrhoea, that occurred in Colina, were obtained. Two hundred twenty six Shigella strains were isolated and studied for susceptibility to ampicilin (AM), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), cotrimoxazole (STX), chloramphenicol (CAF), tetracycline (TET), furazolidine (FU), ciprofloxacine (CIPR), nalidixic acid (AC NAL), gentamycin (GENT) and cefotaxime (CFTX).
RESULTS: Shigella flexnerii represented 134 of 226 Shigella strains isolated. All strains were susceptible to CIPR, AC NAL, GENT and CFTX. Yearly variation of resistance patterns to other antimicrobials were observed for these strains. Resistance to AM varied from 56 to 76%, to AMC from 25 to 56%, to STX from 21 to 47%, to CAF from 36 to 69%, to TET from 44 to 78% and to FU from 9 to 18%. Overall resistance was higher during 1997. All 85 strains of S sonnei were susceptible to CIPR, AC NAL and CFTX. Resistance throughout the years varied from 56 to 88% for AM, from 0 to 28% for AMC, from 44 to 53% for STX, from 11 to 40% for CAF, from 11 to 42% for TET and from 5 to 11% for FU. Overall resistance was also higher during 1997, except for AM and STX. Seven S hoydii strains were isolated, only during 1995. All seven were resistant to AM and TET and none were resistant to FU, CIPR, AC NAL and CFTX. Two strain was resistant to AMC, STX and CAF.
CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance patterns of Shigella sp isolated in Colina have increased from 1995 to 1997, specially for commonly used antimicrobials. Resistance remains low for furazolidine and all strains remain susceptible to quinolones.","['Prado V', 'Pidal P', 'Arellano C', 'Lagos R', 'San Martin O', 'Levine MM']",1998,126,12,Rev Med Chil,"Prado V, et al.

10220442,Protein conjugates of synthetic saccharides elicit higher levels of serum IgG lipopolysaccharide antibodies in mice than do those of the O-specific polysaccharide from Shigella dysenteriae type 1.,"Our development of vaccines to prevent shigellosis is based on the hypothesis that a critical (protective) level of serum IgG to the O-specific polysaccharide (O-SP) domain of Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) confers immunity. The O-SP is a hapten and must be conjugated to a protein to induce serum antibodies. The O-SP of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (approximately 27 tetrasaccharide repeat units), prepared by acid hydrolysis of the LPS, was bound to human serum albumin (HSA) by multiple point attachment (O-SP-HSA): The molar ratio of HSA to O-SP was 1.0. Synthetic saccharides, composed of one or multiples of the O-SP tetrasaccharide, equipped with a spacer at their reducing end, were bound to HSA by a single point attachment: The average molar ratios of the saccharides to HSA ranged from 4 to 24. Serum IgG anti-LPS, elicited in mice by O-SP-HSA or synthetic tetra-, octa-, dodeca-, and hexadecasaccharide fragments, was measured by ELISA. Outbred 6-week-old female mice were injected s.c. three times at biweekly intervals with 2.5 micrograms of saccharide as a conjugate and were bled 7 days after the second and third injections. Excepting the tetramer, conjugates of the octamer, dodecamer and hexadecamer elicited IgG LPS antibodies after the second injection, a statistically significant rise (booster) after the third injection, and higher levels than those vaccinated with O-SP-HSA (P = 0.0001). The highest geometric mean levels of IgG anti-LPS were elicited by the hexadecamer with 9 chains or 9 moles of saccharide/HSA (15.5 ELISA units) followed by the octamer with 20 chains (11.1 ELISA units) and the dodecamer with 10 chains (9.52 ELISA units).

10206458,Hemolytic uremic syndrome in children: platelet aggregation and membrane glycoproteins.,"PURPOSE: Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the fibrin-platelet thrombosis at the microcirculation level in the different clinical conditions of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The relationships between platelet structure and function during the first 4 weeks of evolution of the disease were studied to understand the mechanism of platelet alteration.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Coagulation parameters, platelet counts, and aggregation were studied in 49 children, and membrane glycoproteins (GPs) in 20 of the 49 children (mean age, 17 months) with HUS (Group 2) were studied during the first 4 weeks of evolution of the disease.
RESULTS: No disseminated intravascular coagulation was found in patients with recurrent or persistent thrombocytopenia. Platelet aggregation was sequentially performed during the first weeks of evolution. All patients had a functional decrease in the acute period of HUS. Platelet GPs GPIb, GPIIbIIIa, GPIIb, and GPIIIa were evaluated. GPIIbIIIa complex presented low level and never reached normal values during the first 4 weeks of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Platelet alterations are probably caused by multiple mechanisms: ""exhausted"" platelets, structural membrane alterations caused by arginine-glycine-aspartic peptide blockade, or diminished or nonfunctional membrane GPIb and GPIIbIIIa complexes.","['Sassetti B', 'Vizcargüénaga MI', 'Zanaro NL', 'Silva MV', 'Kordich L', 'Florentini L', 'Diaz M', 'Vitacco M', 'Sanchez Avalos JC']",1999,21,2,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,"Sassetti B, et al.

10102148,Killed oral Shigella vaccine made from Shigella flexneri 2a protects against challenge in the rabbit model of shigellosis.,The protective efficacy of an orally administered heat-killed virulent strain of Shigella flexneri 2a (5 weekly oral doses) was evaluated in 25 rabbits (14 immunized and 11 non-immunized controls) against challenge with the same strain of Shigella using the rabbit model of shigellosis. All 11 non-immunized rabbits developed bloody diarrhoea following challenge and 6 (54%) died. None of the 14 immunized rabbits developed diarrhoea (all had pellet stools) but 3 (21%) died from causes not associated with diarrhoea. Protection from diarrhoea and dysentery following oral immunization with a killed Shigella species was 100% and highly significant. Death following challenge was 2.5-fold higher in the non-immunized group (p = 0.115) but was not significant. These promising results suggest that further studies should be undertaken to develop a killed oral vaccine against shigellosis.,"['Chakrabarti MK', 'Bhattacharya J', 'Bhattacharya MK', 'Nair GB', 'Bhattacharya SK', 'Mahalanabis D']",1999,88,2,Acta Paediatr,"Chakrabarti MK, et al.

Rubella notifications continued to decline in 1997. Notifications of Haemophilus influenzae type b appeared to have stabilised at a low rate, having declined markedly after introduction of the conjugated vaccine in 1992. The number of cases of campylobacteriosis remained steady after having risen for several years. Notifications of hepatitis A cases rose considerably, much of this being due to one outbreak in New South Wales. The number of cases of salmonellosis rose while shigellosis numbers dropped slightly.

In 1989, the clinical problem was recognized as a confounding factor for the experimental work, and steps were taken to eradicate the disease. This was done by a combined approach involving improved sample collection techniques and microbiological methods, treatment of all animals in the colony, and improvement in management. These management changes included alterations in basic facility and cage design, disinfection procedures, and continuous routine microbiological sampling of all groups of animals on a random basis, as well as sampling of those suspected to be at risk for stress-associated Shigella shedding. Using this approach, we have eliminated clinical cases of shigellosis and have not have any further isolations of Shigella from this colony.",['Wolfensohn S'],1998,48,4,Lab Anim Sci,Wolfensohn S.

10081579,Molecular bases of epithelial cell invasion by Shigella flexneri.,"The pathogenesis of shigellosis is characterized by the capacity of the causative microorganism, Shigella, to invade the epithelial cells that compose the mucosal surface of the colon in humans. The invasive process encompasses several steps which can be summarized as follows: entry of bacteria into epithelial cells involves signalling pathways that elicit a macropinocitic event. Upon contact with the cell surface, S. flexneri activates a Mxi/Spa secretory apparatus encoded by two operons comprising about 25 genes located on a large virulence plasmid of 220 kb. Through this specialized secretory apparatus, Ipa invasins are secreted, two of which (IpaB, 62 kDa and IpaC, 42 kDa) form a complex which is itself able to activate entry via its interaction with the host cell membrane. Interaction of this molecular complex with the cell surface elicits major rearrangements of the host cell cytoskeleton, essentially the polymerization of actin filaments that form bundles supporting the membrane projections which achieve bacterial entry. Active recruitment of the protooncogene pp 60c-src has been demonstrated at the entry site with consequent phosphorylation of cortactin. Also, the small GTPase Rho is controlling the cascade of signals that allows elongation of actin filaments from initial nucleation foci underneath the cell membrane. The regulatory signals involved as well as the proteins recruited indicate that Shigella induces the formation of an adherence plaque at the cell surface in order to achieve entry. Once intracellular, the bacterium lyses its phagocytic vacuole, escapes into the cytoplasm and starts moving the inducing polar, directed polymerization of actin on its surface, due to the expression of IcsA, a 120 kDa outer membrane protein, which is localized at one pole of the microorganism, following cleavage by SopA, a plasmid-encoded surface protease. In the context of polarized epithelial cells, bacteria then reach the intermediate junction and engage their components, particularly the cadherins, to form a protrusion which is actively internalized by the adjacent cell. Bacteria then lyse the two membranes, reach the cytoplasmic compartment again, and resume actin-driven movement.","['Sansonetti PJ', 'Egile C']",1998,74,4,Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek,Sansonetti PJ and Egile C.

10078386,[Traveller's diarrhea: which vaccines?].,"Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of child morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries. It is estimated that diarrheal diseases and typhoid fever cause around 2.5 million deaths per year in the world. Four bacteria and one virus share this responsibility: Shigella spp, Escherichia coli ETEC, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi and rotavirus. People travelling in countries with high endemicity of diarrhoeal diseases risk facing these four bacteria or the less common rotavirus, which is usually active in infants, even though some cases of diarrhoea due to rotavirus have already been reported in adults. The usual recommendations concerning basic measures of hygiene are most of the time quickly forgotten and followed only by a small number of travellers (12). Therefore, apart these useful recommendations, it is therefore necessary to consider complementary actions for controlling these diseases which are mainly transmitted by contaminated water and food.

10078385,[Principles and management of the ambulatory treatment of traveller's diarrhea].,"Traveller's Diarrhea (TD, turista) is the most common health disturbance in travellers, affecting 20-50% of two-week travellers depending on their origin, destination and eating habits. The etiological agents most frequently isolated from the stools are enterotoxinogenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., but the rate of isolation of Campylobacter spp. and non cholera vibrios is also high in Asia. Preventive measures in eating habits should in principle be able to curb the incidence of TD but compliance of travellers is usually poor. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has proved effective, but economic, safety and microbiological (drug resistance) considerations discourage its widespread use. Any treatment strategy should consider that TD is usually a self-limiting, benign illness in most travellers, even though infants, elderly people or persons with severe baseline diseases (heart diseases, diabetes, immunocompromised hosts, etc...) may sometimes suffer severe consequences. Adequate rehydration is the cornerstone of treatment and intestinal motility inhibitors may be used in adults (not in children) with severe diarrhea during the first 24 hours if the suspicion of invasive pathogen has been ruled out. Routine antibiotic treatment of TD is controversial, due to the benign nature of the syndrome and to the impossibility to ascertain its causative agent. It should be limited to severe and disabling cases. Among the many antibiotics tested, quinolones are now considered first-choice treatment worldwide, even though disturbing reports of the increasing prevalence of quinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp. from Asia have been recently published. Cotrimoxazole is efficient in Central America. The role of non absorbed antibiotics and probiotics is still to be fully elucidated.","['Castelli F', 'Beltrame A', 'Carosi G']",1998,91,5 Pt 1-2,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,"Castelli F, et al.

10078383,[Vaccines inf the prevention of fecal hazards].,"In addition to the imperative improvement of hygiene standards, vaccines can also be used for the prevention of diseases transmitted by the feco-oral route. Vaccination is essential to protect against poliomyelitis, the eradication of which is targeted through vaccination campaigns using the live, attenuated vaccine in countries where the disease is still endemic and the inactivated vaccine or a combination of both vaccines (mixed schedule) in countries where the disease is under control. The introduction of a specific routine vaccination program against hepatitis A in endemic countries is now starting to be considered. Travellers to these countries must be protected. Among bacterial diseases, only typhoid fever can be prevented by means of an effective vaccine. The difficulties encountered in improving hygiene standards in numerous countries have prompted the WHO to encourage search for new vaccines for the prevention of the diseases transmitted by the feco-oral route. A vaccine against rotavirus that has just been licensed in the USA should permit the global reduction of a significant number of deaths attributable to these viruses. Vaccine prospects for the prevention of hepatitis E are more distant.

DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study.
SETTING: Hospital laboratories in KwaZulu-Natal, including peripheral laboratories and the medical microbiology laboratory of the University of Natal.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of surveillance strains and evaluation of the ability of provincial laboratories to isolate Shigella.
RESULTS: All 354 strains tested were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Co-trimoxazole resistance was found in 92.2% of strains, and 0.8% of strains were resistant to nalidixic acid. All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pivmecillinam, azithromycin, loracarbef and fosfomycin. Of the 29 laboratories surveyed, 18 (62.1%) were able to isolate and identify S. dysenteriae correctly, and 9 (32%) were able to serotype it further to S. dysenteriae type 1. Twenty-seven (93.1%) had appropriate culture media and 26 (89.7%) had antisera for Shigella identification.
CONCLUSIONS: There is little variation among strains of S. dysenteriae type 1 in KwaZulu-Natal with regard to their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Nalidixic acid should remain the antimicrobial of choice for treatment of dysentery in our region as resistance to it is low. The majority of KwaZulu-Natal laboratories have the expertise and equipment to perform the isolation and identification of Shigella species.","['Karas JA', 'Pillay DG', 'Naicker T', 'Sturm AW']",1999,89,1,S Afr Med J,"Karas JA, et al.

A study of 20 such cases showed that all the patients had received a higher than recommended dose of nalidixic acid and that 85% of them were given the drug unnecessarily (i.e., for acute watery diarrhoea). A high concentration of the drug in the commercial preparations as well as the lack of awareness about this among doctors, especially the general practitioners, is the possible contributory factor leading to this situation.

10024597,Interleukin-8 controls bacterial transepithelial translocation at the cost of epithelial destruction in experimental shigellosis.,"In shigellosis, the network of cellular interactions mediated by a balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines or chemokines is clearly tipped toward acute destructive inflammation of intestinal tissues by the bacterial invader. This work has addressed the role played by interleukin-8 (IL-8) in a rabbit model of intestinal invasion by Shigella flexneri. IL-8, which is largely produced by the epithelial cells themselves, appears to be a major mediator of the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to the subepithelial area and transmigration of these cells through the epithelial lining. Neutralization of IL-8 function by monoclonal antibody WS-4 caused a decrease in the amount of PMNs streaming through the lamina propria and the epithelium, thus significantly attenuating the severity of epithelial lesions in areas of bacterial invasion. These findings are in agreement with our previous work (31). In contrast to the PMNs, the bacteria displayed increased transepithelial translocation, as well as overgrowth in the lamina propria and increased passage into the mesenteric blood. By mediating eradication of bacteria at their epithelial entry site, although at the cost of severe epithelial destruction, IL-8 therefore appears to be a key chemokine in the control of bacterial translocation.","['Sansonetti PJ', 'Arondel J', 'Huerre M', 'Harada A', 'Matsushima K']",1999,67,3,Infect Immun,"Sansonetti PJ, et al.

10024595,Involvement of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta in enhancement of pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures caused by Shigella dysenteriae.,"Neurologic manifestations, mainly convulsions, are the most frequent extraintestinal complications of shigellosis. We used an animal model to study the roles of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in Shigella-related seizures. Administration of Shigella dysenteriae 60R sonicate enhanced the sensitivity of mice to the proconvulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) within 7 h. This was indicated by a significantly higher mean convulsion score and an increased number of mice responding with clonic-tonic seizures in the Shigella-pretreated group. Preinjection of mice with anti-murine TNF-alpha (anti-mTNF-alpha) or anti-murine IL-1beta (anti-mIL-1beta) 30 min prior to administration of Shigella sonicate abolished their enhanced response to PTZ at 7 h. Mean convulsion scores were reduced by anti-mTNF-alpha from 1.2 to 0.8 (P = 0.017) and by anti-mIL-1beta from 1.3 to 0.7 (P = 0.008). Preinjection of anti-mTNF-alpha also reduced the percentage of mice responding with clonic-tonic seizures, from 48 to 29% (P = 0.002), and preinjection of anti-mIL-1beta reduced it from 53 to 21% (P = 0. 012). Neutralization of TNF-alpha or IL-1beta did not protect the mice from death due to S. dysenteriae 60R. These findings indicate that TNF-alpha and IL-1beta play a role in the very early sensitization of the central nervous system to convulsive activity after S. dysenteriae administration. Similar mechanisms may trigger neurologic disturbances in other infectious diseases.","['Yuhas Y', 'Shulman L', 'Weizman A', 'Kaminsky E', 'Vanichkin A', 'Ashkenazi S']",1999,67,3,Infect Immun,"Yuhas Y, et al.

9973350,Impact of either elevated or decreased levels of cytochrome bd expression on Shigella flexneri virulence.,"Shigella spp. are the major cause of bacillary dysentery worldwide. The pathogenic process involves bacterial invasion and lysis of the phagocytic vacuole, followed by replication and movement within the cell cytoplasm and, ultimately, spread directly into adjacent cells. This study demonstrates that S. flexneri cytochrome bd expression is necessary for normal intracellular survival and virulence. Cytochrome bd is one of two terminal oxidases in the bacterial respiratory chain that reduce molecular oxygen to water, utilizing intermediates shuttled through the electron transport chain. S. flexneri mutants that contain a disruption in the cydC locus, which leads to defective cytochrome bd expression, or in the riboflavin (ribE) or ubiquinol-8 (ubiH) biosynthetic pathway, which leads to elevated cytochrome bd expression, were evaluated in intracellular survival and virulence assays.

In addition, the level of Re-glycolipid in the blood of patients was determined in EIA with the use of Re-antibodies with the simultaneous study of the rectal microbiocenosis. The degree of dysbiotic disturbances in the intestine was found to be directly related to the levels of LPS of S.flexneri 2a O-antigens and Re-glycolipid of Gram-negative bacteria, circulating in the blood. In the presence of decompensation disturbances of intestinal microflora, delayed Shigella elimination was observed in 15% of the patients and the prolongation of clinical manifestions, in 79.2% of the patients.

9925864,"Central nervous system manifestations of childhood shigellosis: prevalence, risk factors, and outcome.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alterations in consciousness, including seizures, delirium, and coma, are known to occur during Shigella infection. Previous reports have suggested that febrile convulsions and altered consciousness are more common during shigellosis than with other childhood infections. Those reports, however, have been from locations where S dysenteriae type 1 was not common, thus making it difficult to assess the specific contribution that S dysenteriae type 1 infection, and Shiga toxin, might make to the pathogenesis of altered consciousness in children with shigellosis. In this study we seek to determine the prevalence, risk factors, and outcome of altered consciousness in children with shigellosis in Bangladesh, a country where infection with all four species of Shigella is common. We particularly focus on the importance of metabolic abnormalities, which we have previously shown to be a common feature of shigellosis in this population.
METHODS: This study was conducted at the Diarrhea Treatment Centre of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which provides care free of charge to persons with diarrhea. During 1 year, a study physician identified all inpatients infected with Shigella by checking the logs of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory daily. Study physicians obtained demographic and historical information by reviewing the patient charts and by interviewing patients, or their parents or guardians, to confirm or complete the history of illness obtained on admission. Patients were categorized as being conscious or unconscious based on a clinical scale; having a seizure documented in the hospital; or having a seizure by history during the current illness that was not witnessed by medical personnel. Patient outcome was classified as discharged improved, discharged against medical advice, transferred to another health facility, or died in the Treatment Centre. Laboratory examinations were ordered at the discretion of the attending physician; all such information was recorded on the study form. Clinical management was by the attending physician. Factors independently predictive of a documented seizure, or of unconsciousness, were determined using a multiple logistic regression analysis. For this analysis variables associated with unconsciousness or a documented seizure in the analysis of variance or chi2 analyses were entered into the regression equation and eliminated in a backward stepwise fashion if the probability associated with the likelihood ratio statistic exceeded .10.
RESULTS: During this 1-year study, 83 402 persons with diarrhea came to the Treatment Centre for care, and 6290 patients were admitted to the inpatient unit. Shigella was isolated from a stool or rectal swab sample of 863 (13.7%) of the inpatients. Seventy-one (8%) of the inpatients with shigellosis were >/=15 years old; 61 (86%) were conscious; 10 (14%) were unconscious; none had either a documented seizure or a seizure by history during this illness. Seven hundred ninety-two patients were <15 years old (92%); 654 (83%) were conscious; 73 (9%) were unconscious; 41 (5%) had a documented seizure (compared with >/=15-year age group); 24 (3%) had a seizure by history during this illness. Of the 41 patients with documented seizures, 19 (46.3%) had a seizure at the time of admission, and 22 (53.7%) had a seizure after admission. Twenty-five (61.0%) of the 41 patients with documented seizures were reported to have a seizure during this illness before coming to the Treatment Centre. Clinical features that are known to cause altered consciousness-fever, severe dehydration, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, or meningitis-were present in 38 (92.7%) of the 41 patients in whom a seizure was witnessed and in 67 (91.8%) of the 73 patients who were unconscious. Nineteen (46. 3%) of the patients who had a seizure documented had two of these five features, 4 (9.8%) had three, and 1 (2.

Older age (24 months or more), underweight and wasting but not stunting were the host factors significantly more associated with Shigella dysenteriae type I infection than in Shigella flexneri-infected children. Moreover, use of antibiotics at home, use of water from tubewells or pipe-water for drinking and lack of sanitary facilities for defaecation were the behavioural and environmental factors strongly associated with S. dysenteriae type I infection. Children with diarrhoea due to S. flexneri presented with more watery/liquid stools and had a shorter duration of illness. Duration of diarrhoea for 4 or more days was typical of S. dysenteriae type I infection. Interventions to address malnutrition and to promote environmental hygiene would be predicted to offer greater protection against shigellosis due to S. dysenteriae than S. flexneri.","['Faruque AS', 'Teka T', 'Fuchs GJ']",1998,18,3,Ann Trop Paediatr,"Faruque AS, et al.

Children with HUS had lower levels of total IgG and IgM and lower IgM titres to Stx than those with UCS. The number of children with neutralising antibodies was similar in the two groups. Of the children with HUS, 11 had HUS on enrolment and six developed HUS subsequent to enrolment. Antibody titres in children who subsequently developed HUS were compared with those in children with UCS to assess whether differences in antibody titres occurred before the development of HUS. IgA titres to Stx were found to be higher in children who subsequently developed HUS than in those with UCS. However, logistic regression analysis revealed that titres of Stx antibodies in the serum were not significant risk factors for the development of HUS. Thus, although the levels of Stx antibodies were different in children with HUS, and higher IgA titres to Stx were identifiable in children who subsequently developed HUS compared with those with UCS, the relevance of these findings in the development of HUS remains to be elucidated.","['Azim T', 'Rashid A', 'Qadri F', 'Sarker MS', 'Hamadani J', 'Salam MA', 'Wahed MA', 'Albert MJ']",1999,48,1,J Med Microbiol,"Azim T, et al.

This strategy involves the use of two S. flexneri serotypes (2a and 3a), which together bear the all of the major antigenic group factors of this group. The novel attenuated strains used in these studies were S. flexneri 2a strain CVD 1207 (DeltaguaB-A DeltavirG Deltaset1 Deltasen) and S. flexneri 3a strain CVD 1211 (DeltaguaB-A DeltavirG Deltasen).

Guinea pigs that were immunized with these two vaccine strains produced serum and mucosal antibodies that cross-reacted with all the S. flexneri serotypes tested (except of S. flexneri serotype 6) as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, and slide agglutination. Furthermore, the combination vaccine conferred significant protection against challenge with S. flexneri serotypes 1b, 2b, 5b, and Y but not with serotypes 1a, 4b, or (as predicted) 6.","['Noriega FR', 'Liao FM', 'Maneval DR', 'Ren S', 'Formal SB', 'Levine MM']",1999,67,2,Infect Immun,"Noriega FR, et al.

After 24 h, rabbits were given 6-h colonic infusions of SCFA (acetate, propionate, n-butyrate; 60:30:40 mM) or SCFA-free solution (control); groups of rabbits were killed in batches of 2 or 3 animals at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after treatment, for histologic and bacteriologic assessment. SCFA significantly reduced fecal blood and mucus and improved clinical symptoms. Histologically, SCFA significantly (P<.01) reduced mucosal congestion, cellular infiltration, and necrotic changes. SCFA also significantly (P<.05) reduced the number of shigellae in the colon. No such improvements occurred in the control group.

There are recommended preventive measures based on health education and improvement of sewage and water facilities; however these recommendations given for many years have not reached the expected results for different reasons. Antibiotherapy was very effective for many years; unfortunately increasing antibiotic resistance has been reported, particularly in Shigella and typhoid fever treatment. This explains the re-kindled interest currently taking place in vaccines development against infections due to V. cholerae, Shigella, E.coli ETEC, S. typhi and rotavirus. The new available vaccines are very effective and provide greater protection than that given by the old killed injectable vaccines. They paved the way for development of new candidate vaccines easier to deliver (oral vaccines or one dose parenteral vaccine), which already give promising results. Some of these candidate vaccines like those related to Shigella infections are considered as a future promising tool for controlling diarrhea due to Shigella.","['Ivanoff B', 'Neira M']",1998,149,6,Ann Med Interne (Paris),Ivanoff B and Neira M.

9849989,Low yield of bacterial stool culture in children with nosocomial diarrhea.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bacterial stool cultures (BSC) are useful in initial evaluation of children with symptoms of nosocomial diarrhea. To answer this question we performed a retrospective record review to determine the yield of BSC in children who developed diarrhea after the third hospital day (HD-3).
METHODS: The hospital computer record keeping system was utilized to compile the result of BSC collected from children and adolescents ages 0 to 20 years between January 1, 1988, and October 31, 1996. All specimens were analyzed for Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia and Campylobacter. We reviewed hospital charts of all children who developed a positive BSC beyond HD-3 to determine the time of onset of diarrhea and clinical circumstances.
RESULTS: A total of 11 516 BSCs were submitted from 9262 children during the 8 1/2-year period. Five hundred sixty-eight (6.6%) of 9262 children had at least 1 positive BSC. Two thousand five hundred seventy-two children had the first BSC submitted after HD-3 and 13 (0.5%) of these children had a positive result. Chart review of these 13 children demonstrated that 6 had onset of diarrhea during the first 3 hospital days. Therefore only 7 children met our criteria for having nosocomially acquired diarrhea caused by a bacterial pathogen. Children whose first BSC was submitted after HD-3 accounted for 3767 (46%) of the total 8126 inpatient BSCs and in excess of $21000 annually in patient billing charges.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of a known exposure the isolation of a bacterial pathogen from the stool of children with onset of diarrhea beyond HD-3 is a rare event. Under most circumstances BSC should not be part of the initial evaluation of children with symptoms of nosocomial diarrhea.","['Craven D', 'Brick D', 'Morrisey A', ""O'Riordan MA"", 'Petran V', 'Schreiber JR']",1998,17,11,Pediatr Infect Dis J,"Craven D, et al.

9829203,Topics in dose-response modeling.,"Great uncertainty exists in conducting dose-response assessment for microbial pathogens. The data to support quantitative modeling of dose-response relationships are meager. Our philosophy in developing methodology to conduct microbial risk assessments has been to rely on data analysis and formal inferencing from the available data in constructing dose-response and exposure models. The probability of illness is a complex function of factors associated with the disease triangle: the host, the pathogen, and the environment including the food vehicle and indigenous microbial competitors. The epidemiological triangle and interactions between the components of the triangle are used to illustrate key issues in dose-response modeling that impact the estimation of risk and attendant uncertainty. Distinguishing between uncertainty (what is unknown) and variability (heterogeneity) is crucial in risk assessment. Uncertainty includes components that are associated with (i) parameter estimation for a given assumed model, and (ii) the unknown ""true"" model form among many plausible alternatives such as the exponential, Beta-Poisson, probit, logistic, and Gompertz. Uncertainty may be grossly understated if plausible alternative models are not tested in the analysis. Examples are presented of the impact of variability and uncertainty on species, strain, or serotype of microbial pathogens; variability in human response to administered doses of pathogens; and effects of threshold and nonthreshold models. Some discussion of the usefulness and limitations of epidemiological data is presented. Criteria for development of surrogate dose-response models are proposed for pathogens for which human data are lacking. Alternative dose-response models which consider biological plausibility are presented for predicting the probability of illness.","['Coleman M', 'Marks H']",1998,61,11,J Food Prot,Coleman M and Marks H.

We examined the effects of pig age, pig breed and antibiotic pretreatment upon Shigella infection. Shigella dysenteriae, and Shigella flexneri (both virulent and avirulent strains) were utilized. Our results indicated that young (4-week-old), conventionally re ared, domestic pigs were routinely, but briefly, colonized (average=3.5+/-2.5 days) following oral or gavage administration ofS. flexneri, as determined by direct rectal cultures. The duration of S. dysenteriae colonization was significantly shorter. Inoculation of younger (2 days) or older (9 weeks) pigs with S. flexneri had no significant effect on infection duration. Similarly, infection of 4-week-old pigs with virulent and avirulent strains of S. flexneri had no effect upon the duration of infection, nor did the use of a swine-passaged S. flexneri isolate. Marked clinical, histopathological (gross and microscopic) and immunoIhistopathological signs of disease were absent in all infections. However, in instances where microscopic histopathological evidence was used to correctly identify infected pigs, tonsillar lesions were the consistently noted criteria. The tonsils are believed to be an important portal of entry for Salmonella choleraesuis, another member of the Enterobacteriaceae and a prevalent pig pathogen.

9817757,Interferon alpha inhibits a Src-mediated pathway necessary for Shigella-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements in epithelial cells.,"Shigella flexneri, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, has the ability to enter nonphagocytic cells. The interferon (IFN) family of cytokines was found to inhibit Shigella invasion of cultured epithelial cells. We show here that IFN-alpha inhibits a Src-dependent signaling cascade triggered by Shigella that leads to the reorganization of the host cell cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence studies showed that IFN-alpha inhibits Shigella-induced actin polymerization required for bacterial entry into cells. Phosphorylation of cortactin, a Src-substrate specifically tyrosyl-phosphorylated during Shigella entry, was inhibited by IFN-alpha. Overexpression of a dominant interfering form of pp60c-src led to inhibition of Shigella-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements and decreased cortactin phosphorylation indicating a role for Src in Shigella entry. Also, Shigella uptake in cells that expressed constitutively active Src was unaffected by IFN-alpha treatment. We conclude that Src kinase activity is necessary for Shigella invasion of epithelial cells and that IFN-alpha inhibits this Src-dependent signaling pathway.","['Duménil G', 'Olivo JC', 'Pellegrini S', 'Fellous M', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Nhieu GT']",1998,143,4,J Cell Biol,"Duménil G, et al.

9808414,"Antimicrobial susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production of Shigella isolates in Crete, Greece, during the period 1991-1995.","The susceptibility to 11 antibiotics was determined for 52 strains of Shigella isolated from patients with diarrheal disease in Crete, Greece, during the period 1991-1995. Forty-six percent of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 48% to tetracycline, 44.2% to chloramphenicol, and 28.8% to cotrimoxazole. Shigella flexneri was more resistant than S. sonnei to ampicillin (82 vs 4.3%), to tetracycline (82 vs 8.7%) and to cotrimoxazole (42.8 vs 13%). Overall, 82% of all S. flexneri isolates were resistant to the three or four antimicrobial agents tested. The beta-lactamases produced by shigellae were identified by isoelectric focusing and were found to be OXA-1, TEM-1, and a low-level beta-lactamase with a pI>8. The results from the present study, which is the first carried out in Crete, emphasize the need for continuous surveillance of resistance and control of antibiotic usage.","['Maraki S', 'Georgiladakis A', 'Christidou A', 'Scoulica E', 'Tselentis Y']",1998,106,9,APMIS,"Maraki S, et al.

9808228,Urinary retinol excretion and kidney function in children with shigellosis.,"BACKGROUND: Acute infections, including diarrhea, are associated with an increased risk of vitamin A deficiency. Urinary retinol excretion during such infections may contribute to this risk. The mechanism accounting for urinary retinol loss has not been clearly defined.
OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to determine whether urinary retinol loss in children with acute infection is associated with impaired kidney function, particularly impaired tubular protein reabsorption.
DESIGN: Urinary retinol excretion and kidney function were examined in 66 hospitalized children 5 mo to 5 y of age with acute Shigella dysentery.
RESULTS: Urinary retinol loss occurred in 59% of children and was substantial (>0.1 micromol/d) in 8% of them. Children with more severe disease excreted higher concentrations of urinary retinol; those with a body temperature > or =40 degrees C excreted a mean of 0.10 +/- 0.18 micromol/d compared with 0.005 +/- 0.008 micromol/d for other children (P < 0.0001). Children with more severe disease also had impaired tubular reabsorption of low-molecular-weight proteins beta2-microglobulin and retinol binding protein (RBP)], although other measures of tubular and glomerular function were not similarly impaired. In multiple regression analysis, severity of disease indicators were the best predictors of tubular reabsorption of beta2-microglobulin (R2 = 0.53) whereas tubular reabsorption of beta2-microglobulin and RBP were found to be the best predictors of urinary retinol loss (R2 = 0.69).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant amount of retinol was excreted in the urine in children with shigellosis: 8% excreted >0.10 micromol/d (15% of the daily metabolic requirement). Impaired tubular reabsorption of low-molecular-weight proteins, such as RBP transporting retinol, appeared to be the cause of this urinary retinol loss.","['Mitra AK', 'Alvarez JO', 'Guay-Woodford L', 'Fuchs GJ', 'Wahed MA', 'Stephensen CB']",1998,68,5,Am J Clin Nutr,"Mitra AK, et al.

9808227,Predictors of serum retinol in children with shigellosis.,"BACKGROUND: Low serum retinol can be useful as an indicator of depleted liver vitamin A stores, particularly in population-based studies. However, serum retinol concentrations decrease transiently during infection, independent of any changes in liver stores. The magnitude of the decrease in serum retinol is often proportional to indicators of disease severity.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation of serum retinol in children with culture-positive shigellosis with severity of illness, anthropometric indicators of nutritional status, urinary retinol excretion, and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, retinol binding protein, and transthyretin.
DESIGN: This was a prospective study assessing the clinical and laboratory measurements at admission and recovery of 90 children with dysentery (66 with shigellosis) hospitalized in Bangladesh.
RESULTS: Serum retinol concentrations were low at admission but were significantly greater at discharge even though no vitamin A supplements were given during the illness (0.36 +/- 0.22 compared with 1.15 +/- 0.50 micromol/L, P < 0.001). Serum retinol concentrations were lower in children with Shigella dysenteriae type 1 infection than in children with shigellosis due to less virulent strains of Shigella. Low serum retinol was independently associated with S. dysenteriae type 1, high serum C-reactive protein concentrations, and low weight-forage in multiple regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that shigellosis was associated with a significant, transient decrease in serum retinol concentrations of approximately 0.8 micromol/L, and that this change was significantly associated with severity of disease and poor underlying nutritional status, particularly low weight-for-age.","['Mitra AK', 'Alvarez JO', 'Wahed MA', 'Fuchs GJ', 'Stephensen CB']",1998,68,5,Am J Clin Nutr,"Mitra AK, et al.

9796193,[A case of bacillary dysentery caused by new quinolone-resistant Shigella flexneri 2a].,"A 73-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of detection of Shigella flexneri 2a from his stool. Antimicrobial treatment with levofloxacin (LVFX) was started, but could not eliminate the organism in the stool. In the examination of drug susceptibility, this strain was highly resistant to all new quinolones. The minimal inhibitory concentration of norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to this strain was 12.5 micrograms/ml, 6.25 micrograms/ml and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The dual mutations were detected in the codon 83 and 87 of the gyrA gene by sequencing the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR). There was, however, no significant difference between the intracellular uptake of ciprofloxacin in this strain and in the ciprofloxacin-sensitive strain. The amount of ciprofloxacin in this strain unchanged when carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was added. These results suggest that the advanced resistance in Shigella flexneri against new quinolones could be acquired by only this dual mutations without the change of the active efflux mechanism.","['Yoshimura K', 'Kawashima I', 'Obana M', 'Matsuoka Y', 'Irimajiri S', 'Oonaka K', 'Fukuyama M']",1998,72,9,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Yoshimura K, et al.

The causal organism was resistant to all antibiotics available from the public health authorities. The only effective antimicrobial agent available was ciprofloxacin. It was given to 326 inpatients at the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Center, mostly children under the age of 5, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients. A standard dose schedule was used: 1 g ciprofloxacin per day in two doses for 5 days for adults, 250 mg for children weighing less than 20 kg and 500 mg for children weighing less than 50 kg. The treatment was effective in 285 patients (85.6%) according to clinical criteria. Treatment was unsuccessful in 6 patients and 14 decided to stop taking the medication although it was having a positive effect. No side effects clearly caused by the treatment have been reported. This is consistent with previous reports showing that ciprofloxacin is clinically effective against epidemic dysentery caused by multi-drug resistant Shigella dysenteriae type I.

9785361,Local and systemic effects of macrophage cytokines in intestinal inflammation.,"The activation of macrophages and newly recruited monocytes appears to be common to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, despite different inductive stimuli. Similar activation occurs acutely during the course of invasive intestinal infections such as shigellosis, but is then usually downregulated. The macrophage cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are centrally involved in the local inflammatory response, and blockade of either cytokine greatly attenuates the inflammatory lesion. Induction of focal vascular thrombosis and matrix degradation are thought to be an important component of this focal damage. Both cytokines and IL-6 are now recognized to contribute to the systemic effects of intestinal disease, including growth suppression, anorexia, and chronic anemia. Disturbance of sleep patterns, mood, and affect may also occur, and recent evidence points towards bidirectional interplay between macrophage cytokines and central nervous system function.",['Murch SH'],1998,14,10,Nutrition,Murch SH.

They were fed either a high-protein (HP) diet with 15% of energy as protein, or a standard-protein (SP) diet with 7.5% energy as protein, for 3 wk in a metabolic study ward. Children were followed up bi-weekly for 6 mo by trained health assistants when anthropometric measurements and information of any illness were collected. Thirty-one children in the HP group and 28 children in the SP group completed 6-mo follow-up. The increase in height (mean +/- SD) was 5.3 +/- 1.0 cm vs. 4.1 +/- 1.1 cm for HP and SP groups, respectively (P < 0.001), whereas increase in body weight was 1.39 +/- 0.58 and 1.29 +/- 0.72 kg for children fed HP and SP, respectively (P = 0.59). The proportion of children who were severely stunted (< -2 SD height-for-age) decreased from 45 to 29% in the HP group compared to 50 to 46% in the SP group (P < 0.05) at 6-mo follow-up. The number of diarrheal episodes per child tended to be lower in the HP vs. SP than in the SP group (1.9 vs. 2.3, P = 0.41).

9769662,[Shigellae isolated in 1997--plasmid profiles and antibiotic resistance].,"INTRODUCTION: Shigella spp is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria causing acute diarrhea with us. Genetics of pathogenicity of Shigella spp. includes chromosomal and plasmid genes. Most virulence factors are coded by invasion plasmid antigen genes residing on a 180-230 MDa plasmid. There is a big problem with multiple resistance of Shigella spp. strains, which is mostly plasmid-borne. Genetic analysis of bacterial cells, that is plasmid profile analysis, is important for investigation of sources and ways of spreading of the infection. All isolates originating from the same clone have identical plasmid profiles, i.e. number and size of plasmids. The aim of the investigation was: comparing the type of resistance to antimicrobical agents found in epidemic and nonepidemic. Shigella strains isolated in 1997, analyzing plasmid profiles of these isolates and confirming their epidemic connection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Susceptibility to antibiotics was examined by a standard disc-diffusion method. Plasmid profiles of 40 strains (20 from the outbreak and 20 from sporadic cases) were tested using a method of alkaline lysis by Birnboim and Doly followed by electrophoresis in agarose gel.
RESULTS: Shigella strains were resistant to antimicrobial agents which are most commonly used. Epidemic isolates shared the same resistance type, they were resistant to cephalexin, streptomycin and co-trimoxazole. The dominant type of resistance of nonepidemic strains was to ampicillin, streptomycin and co-trimoxazole. Strains isolated during the outbreak had identical plasmid profiles (2 plasmid bands of 55 and 1.5 MDa). Non-epidemic isolates had different plasmid profiles as well as type of resistance.
CONCLUSION: Strains of Shigella spp. isolated during an outbreak had the same type of resistance and the same plasmid profiles, which indicated their origin from the same clone. The plasmid profile analysis is a reliable and precise method for determination of epidemic connection of Shigella isolates.","['Jelesić Z', 'Kulauzov M', 'Kozoderović G']",1998,51,7-8,Med Pregl,"Jelesić Z, et al.

Quantitation of mucosal mast cells showed that they were significantly higher in the deeper lamina propria where blood vessels and nerves were more abundant. There was no difference in mast cell counts or degranulation in the mucosa in both groups of patients and controls. Intraepithelial mast cells were decreased in the patients. The prevalence of lipid bodies was significantly higher in mast cells from patients with cholera and shigellosis (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that mast cell populations are more dense around blood vessels and nerves and that inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid metabolites, as indicated by the lipid bodies, are the response of mast cells to the alterations in diarrhea, despite differences in the etiology of diarrhea.","['Pulimood AB', 'Mathan MM', 'Mathan VI']",1998,43,9,Dig Dis Sci,"Pulimood AB, et al.

9747754,Shigella infections among children in Andaman--an archipelago of tropical islands in Bay of Bengal.,"Shigellosis is common among children in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Our experience showed two distinct features of shigellosis within a span of 3 years in 1994-6: (i) changing patterns of serotype or subtype specific shigellosis and (ii) emergence of multidrug resistant isolates with changing R-patterns. The rate of isolation was 10.4-27.9% with the rate of isolation of Shigella flexneri interchanging with S. dysenteriae alternately. In 1994, S. flexneri superseded S. dysenteriae (48.6% vs. 33.3%; P < 0.05) while S. dysenteriae dominated over S. flexneri in 1995 (54.7% vs. 34.0%; P < 0.05). The picture reversed again in 1996 (63.0% vs. 22.2%; P < 0.05). Among shigellae isolates, the commonest serotypes were S. dysenteriae type 1 and S. flexneri type 2a. Isolated shigellae were of multidrug resistant type. Seven R-patterns were observed in 1994, while 8R-patterns were observed during the next year with the emergence of nalidixic acid resistance. In 1996, emergence of gentamicin resistance was also observed. All isolates were resistant to ampicillin and sensitive to quinolones. The MIC of nalidixic acid and gentamicin are > or = 128 microg/ml and > or = 64 microg/ml respectively.

9723908,The Shigella virulence gene regulatory cascade: a paradigm of bacterial gene control mechanisms.,"Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Its virulence regulon is subject to tight control by several mechanisms involving the products of over 20 genes and an array of environmental signals. The reguIon is carried on a plasmid that is prone to instability and to integration into the chromosome, with associated silencing of the virulence genes. Closely related regulons are found in other species of Shigella and in enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. A wealth of detailed information is now available on the Shigella virulence gene control circuits, and it is becoming clear that these share many features with regulatory systems found in other bacterial pathogens. All of this makes the S. flexneri virulence gene control system a very attractive topic for those interested in the nature of gene regulatory networks in bacteria.","['Dorman CJ', 'Porter ME']",1998,29,3,Mol Microbiol,Dorman CJ and Porter ME.

Over these periods the trend of the incidence of shigellosis showed that 18% of the total strains were isolated during the invasion year (1990) followed by an upsurge (24%) during the Gulf War period (1991) and a steady decline in the post-war period, 17% in 1992 and 14% in 1993. There was another wave of increased isolation rate (27%) during a period of relative calm in the country (1996) studied for comparison. The predominant Shigella species was S. flexneri which accounted for 46% of the 202 isolates, followed by S. sonnei (42%), S. dysenteriae (7%) and S. boydii (5%). Fifty-four percent of the 202 Shigella isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 56% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 35% to chloramphenicol, 13% and 9% to cephalothin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid respectively. All the isolates were fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin, the aminoglycosides and the second- and third-generation cephalosporins. Eighty-seven (43%) of the 202 isolates were resistant to two or more antibiotics. Of the 87 multiply resistant Shigella spp., 58 (67%) were S. flexneri while 19 (22%) were S. sonnei.

9717250,Molecular and cellular mechanisms of invasion of the intestinal barrier by enteric pathogens. The paradigm of Shigella.,"The pathogenesis of bacillary dysentery can be studied at different levels of integration of the cellular components that constitute the colonic mucosal barrier. We considered the interaction of Shigella flexneri in three experimental systems that provide complementary information and a scheme of events occurring in human colorectal mucosa as Shigella invasion proceeds. Interaction of S. flexneri with individual epithelial cells shows a series of events in which the bacterium, upon contact with the cell surface, releases a set of Ipa proteins (i.e. invasins) through a specialized, activable, type-III secretory apparatus (i.e. Mxi/Spa). Via a complex signaling process, these invasins cause major rearrangements of the subcortical cytoskeletal network which allow bacterial entry by a macropinocytotic event. Then the bacterium lyses its phagocytotic vacuole and initiates intracytoplasmic movement, due to polar assembly of actin filaments caused by a bacterial surface protein, IcsA. This allows very efficient colonization of the host cell cytoplasm and passage to adjacent cells via protrusions which are engulfed by a cadherin-dependent process. However, when invasive Shigella are deposited on the apical side of polarized monolayers of human colonic cells, they appear unable to invade, indicating that bacteria need to reach the subepithelial area to invade the epithelium. In this system, it has been shown that transepithelial signaling caused by apical bacteria induces adherence and transmigration of basal polymorphonuclears (PMN), thus disrupting the monolayer permeability and facilitating bacterial invasion. LPS accounts for a large part of this transepithelial signalization to PMN. Such a process could account for invasion in intestinal crypts. Finally, models of infection, such as the rabbit ligated intestinal loop show that initial bacterial entry occurs essentially via M cells of the follicular associated epithelium. It then causes apoptosis of macrophages located in the follicular dome, inducing release of IL-1 beta which, in turn, initiates inflammation, leading to destabilization of the epithelial structures as modeled above. These data can now be used to understand the mechanisms of mucosal protection against bacillary dysentery.",['Sansonetti PJ'],1998,43,3,Folia Microbiol (Praha),Sansonetti PJ.

The fluoroquinolone agent ciprofloxacin is active in vitro against these strains of bacteria, but has not been routinely used to treat acute childhood infections because of concern that quinolones may cause arthropathy in children. We undertook a randomised double-blind study to test the effects of ciprofloxacin treatment in children with shigella dysentery.
METHODS: We compared the efficacy and toxic effects of ciprofloxacin suspension (10 mg/kg every 12 h for 5 days, maximum individual dose 500 mg) with those of pivmecillinam tablets (15-20 mg/kg every 8 h for 5 days, maximum individual dose 300 mg). We enrolled 143 children aged 2-15 years with dysentery of 72 h or less duration. Patients stayed in hospital for 6 days, and were followed up 7, 30, and 180 days after hospital discharge. Joint symptoms and function were assessed daily for 6 days. Clinical success was defined as the absence of frank dysentery on day 3, and on day 5 no bloody-mucoid stools, one or no watery stool, six or fewer total stools, and no fever. If no shigella were isolated from faecal samples on day 3 or thereafter, treatment was judged bacteriologically successful.
FINDINGS: 13 patients were excluded since they did not meet eligibility criteria; 10 withdrew before day 5. Thus 120 patients (60 in each group) completed the study. Treatment was clinically successful in 48 (80%) of 60 patients who received ciprofloxacin and in 39 (65%) of 60 patients who received pivmecillinam (p=0.10). Treatment was bacteriologically successful in all of the patients receiving ciprofloxacin, and in 54 (90%) of the patients receiving pivmecillinam (p=0.03). Joint pain after treatment began in 13 (18%) of 71 patients who received ciprofloxacin and 16 (22%) of 72 patients who received pivmecillinam (p>0.2), and no patient had signs of arthritis.
INTERPRETATION: In our trial, ciprofloxacin suspension and pivmecillinam had the same clinical efficacy. Ciprofloxacin had greater bacteriological efficacy and was not associated with the development of arthropathy. We conclude that ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe drug for use in multiply resistant childhood shigellosis.","['Salam MA', 'Dhar U', 'Khan WA', 'Bennish ML']",1998,352,9127,Lancet,"Salam MA, et al.

9705363,Study of the relatedness of isolates of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei obtained in 1986 and 1987 and in 1994 and 1995 from Hong Kong.,"We used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to study the genetic relatedness of 235 isolates of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei collected in Hong Kong (97 isolates from 1986 and 1987 and 138 isolates from 1994 and 1995). Altogether, 13 gels were run with bacteriophage lambda ladder DNA (Pharmacia) as an external reference in every sixth lane, standardized reagents and methods, and isolates randomized for species and years. For quantitative illustration of the relationships within a large body of isolates, computer-generated dendrograms were used to determine the number of isolates in pulsotypes at Dice coefficients of similarity of 75% (PT75) and 50% (PT50). For S. flexneri, there was a significant difference in the distribution of isolates collected during the two periods in both PT75 and PT50, with 68% of isolates collected in 1994 and 1995 sharing a coefficient of similarity of >/=68%. For S. sonnei, a significant difference was observed in PT50 only. We also used Upholt's formula for an approximation of the fraction of nucleotide difference between isolates and Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis to determine relative genetic distances. For both species, the relative genetic distances between isolates of the earlier collection period were significantly greater (P < 0.0001), i. e., they were further apart and therefore more diverse than those of the later period. We conclude that it is possible for a typical clinical laboratory to analyze a large amount of PFGE information on Shigella isolates obtained under controlled conditions. Such data analysis should enhance surveillance capabilities and give indications of further work to be done on various aspects of bacterial pathogenicity of the species.","['Houang ET', 'Chu Y', 'Ng T', 'Cheng AF']",1998,36,9,J Clin Microbiol,"Houang ET, et al.

9703984,Alterations in high molecular mass penicillin-binding protein 1 associated with beta-lactam resistance in Shigella dysenteriae.,"Beta-lactam resistance poses a major problem in the chemotherapy of shigellosis caused by Shigella dysenteriae. Such resistance may arise from alterations in the affinities or amounts of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) for beta-lactams, elaboration of beta-lactamases and reduced permeability across the outer membrane. The mechanisms of resistance in S. dysenteriae have not been studied in depth. This report describes a laboratory mutant, M19 which was characterized by the appearance of two high molecular mass PBPs of 84 (PBP1') and 82 kDa (PBP1""). M19 was more resistant to cefsulodin and cefoxitin. Resistance could be correlated with lower second order rate constants (k+2/K) of acylation. Moreover there was an overall two-fold increase in the relative amount of PBP1 (i.e. 1' + 1"") in the mutant M19 compared to C152. This is the first report which presents evidence of the involvement of altered high molecular mass PBPs in beta-lactam resistance in S. dysenteriae.","['Ghosh AS', 'Kar AK', 'Kundu M']",1998,248,3,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Ghosh AS, et al.

Stool samples from 271 infants and 268 older siblings were tested for astrovirus, adenovirus 40/41, rotavirus and Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter species. Concurrent diarrhea, vomiting, fever, or anorexia were noted. Astrovirus was detected in 164 infants (61%) and 20 siblings (7%). Rotavirus (4%) and adenovirus 40/41 (13%) were isolated less frequently. Of all diarrheal episodes reported at a visit, 26% (78/305) were associated with astrovirus; 17% (78/452) of astrovirus infections were associated with diarrhea and 9% with other symptoms. Only diarrhea was associated with astrovirus infection (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.92; P = .01). Of infants with astrovirus, 70% shed at multiple visits over a period of 2-17 weeks (median, 5). The point prevalence of astrovirus infection was significantly higher among infants than siblings (relative risk, 6.18; 95% CI, 3.93-9.72; P < .0001, chi2).

9695914,"SepA, the 110 kDa protein secreted by Shigella flexneri: two-domain structure and proteolytic activity.","Shigellosis is characterized by a strong inflammatory response which is induced by bacteria invading the colonic mucosa. Characterization of a sepA mutant indicated that SepA, the major protein secreted by Shigella flexneri growing in laboratory media, might be involved in invasion and destruction of the host intestinal epithelium. The sequence of the first 500 residues of mature SepA (110 kDa) is homologous to that of the N-terminal region of IgA1 proteases. To investigate the potential proteolytic activity of SepA, the activity of the purified protein on a wide range of synthetic peptides was tested. SepA hydrolysed several of these substrates and the activity was inhibited by PMSF. Several peptides which were hydrolysed by SepA have been described as specific substrates for cathepsin G, a serine protease produced by polymorphonuclear leukocytes that was proposed to play a role in inflammation. However, unlike cathepsin G, SepA degraded neither fibronectin nor angiotensin I and had no effect on aggregation of human platelets. In addition, analysis of SepA hydrolysis by proteinase K suggested that the protein is composed of two domains of about 450 residues separated by a hinge region of 100 residues. The 47 kDa N-terminal domain was stable and endowed with proteolytic activity.","['Benjelloun-Touimi Z', 'Si Tahar M', 'Montecucco C', 'Sansonetti PJ', 'Parsot C']",1998,144 ( Pt 7),,Microbiology (Reading),"Benjelloun-Touimi Z, et al.

9695753,Antimicrobial resistances among Shigella in New Zealand.,"AIM: To determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistances among recent isolates of Shigella in New Zealand.
METHOD: A total of 107 Shigella isolates referred to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research from 20 hospital and community laboratories between January and June 1996 were tested by an agar dilution method.
RESULTS: Shigella sonnei accounted for 70% of the isolates and S flexneri for 23%. Resistance to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole was detected in 42% and 57% of the isolates respectively, and combined ampicillin and co-trimoxazole resistance occurred in 30.8% of the isolates. The prevalence of cephalothin resistance was 5.6%. Resistance to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacid and gentamicin was not detected and 31.8% were sensitive to all agents tested. Ampicillin resistance was significantly more prevalent in S flexneri than S sonnei.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance indicates that ampicillin and cotrimoxazole are no longer useful for empirical treatment of shigellosis in New Zealand.

METHODS: Stool samples were collected from children under the age of 5 years who visited the Diarrhoea Training Unit (DTU) of Zambia University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, between May 1992 and May 1993. A total of 639 children were evaluated for the presence of bacterial infection using standard culture media. The prevalence of bacterial pathogens was compared with that reported from other developing countries.
RESULTS: Pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli were isolated from 95 (14.9%) children, Shigella species from 65 (10.2%) children, and Vibrio cholerae from 21 (3.3%) children. The presence of visible blood in the feces was an early indicator of the presence of shigellosis.
CONCLUSIONS: E. coli, Shigella species and Vibrio cholerae were the major causes of bacterial diarrhea in the Zambian children studied. Research is required to determine the prevalence of such enteropathogenic strains. The use of adequate diagnostic procedures is indispensable to appropriate management.

For comparative purposes we analyzed 53 outbreak-related isolates of Shigella sonnei using different subtyping methods and studied the epidemiology of the outbreaks. It appeared from our study that DNA-based techniques such as plasmid typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were more useful tools for subtyping Shigella sonnei than colicin typing and the antimicrobial susceptibility test. Moreover, according to PFGE analysis, four genetically related isolates of Shigella sonnei were responsible for the eight sequential outbreaks. To further investigate the epidemiology of outbreaks, 58 sporadic isolates of Shigella sonnei from overseas travelers with shigellosis during the same period were also examined. We found that some sporadic isolates from travelers in Asia were genetically related to those of the outbreak-related isolates, indicating that genetically related isolates prevailed in Asia during this period, probably because of the extensive movement of people or food.","['Matsumoto M', 'Suzuki Y', 'Saito M', 'Ishikawa N', 'Ohta M']",1998,42,4,Microbiol Immunol,"Matsumoto M, et al.

9582283,Induction of type III secretion in Shigella flexneri is associated with differential control of transcription of genes encoding secreted proteins.,"Shigella, the etiological agent of human bacillary dysentery, invades the colonic epithelium where it induces an intense inflammatory response. Entry of Shigella into epithelial cells involves a type III secretion machinery, encoded by the mxi and spa operons, and the IpaA-D secreted proteins. In this study, we have identified secreted proteins of 46 and 60 kDa as the products of virA and ipaH9.8, respectively, the latter being a member of the ipaH multigene family. Inactivation of virA did not affect entry into epithelial cells. Using lacZ transcriptional fusions, we found that transcription of virA and four ipaH genes, but not that of the ipaBCDA and mxi operons, was markedly increased during growth in the presence of Congo red and in an ipaD mutant, two conditions in which secretion through the Mxi-Spa machinery is enhanced. Transcription of the virA and ipaH genes was also transiently activated upon entry into epithelial cells.

9582270,Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is implicated in the actin-based motility of Shigella flexneri.,"Shigella, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, is capable of directing its own movement in the cytoplasm of infected epithelial cells. The bacterial surface protein VirG recruits host components mediating actin polymerization, which is thought to serve as the propulsive force. Here, we show that neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), which is a critical target for filopodium formation downstream of Cdc42, is required for assembly of the actin tail generated by intracellular S.flexneri. N-WASP accumulates at the front of the actin tail and is capable of interacting with VirG in vitro and in vivo, a phenomenon that is not observed in intracellular Listeria monocytogenes. The verprolin-homology region in N-WASP was required for binding to the glycine-rich repeats domain of VirG, an essential domain for recruitment of F-actin on intracellular S.flexneri. Overexpression of a dominant-negative N-WASP mutant greatly inhibited formation of the actin tail by intracellular S.flexneri. Furthermore, depletion of N-WASP from Xenopus egg extracts shut off Shigella actin tail assembly, and this was restored upon addition of N-WASP protein, suggesting that N-WASP is a critical host factor for the assembly of the actin tail by intracellular Shigella.","['Suzuki T', 'Miki H', 'Takenawa T', 'Sasakawa C']",1998,17,10,EMBO J,"Suzuki T, et al.

9611703,"Differences in notifiable infectious disease morbidity among adult women--United States, 1992-1994.","By 1990, all 50 states were using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance to report individual case data that included demographic information (without personal identifiers) about most notifiable diseases. This analysis of National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) data is useful for evaluating the distribution of reported notifiable infectious diseases among adult women by age and race. The number of cases of the 48 nationally notifiable infectious diseases reported among adult women (i.e., women > or = 15 years of age) were compiled for 1992-1994. These data were then analyzed by age and race, and rates per 100,000 adult women were calculated. During 1992-1994, the 10 most commonly reported nationally notifiable diseases among adult women in the United States were, in descending order of frequency, gonorrhea, primary/secondary syphilis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), salmonellosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, shigellosis, Lyme disease, and hepatitis C/non-A non-B. Gonorrhea was the most commonly reported notifiable infectious disease for women of all ages, except those ages > or = 55 years, and for women of all races, except Asian/Pacific Islanders. Tuberculosis was the most commonly reported infectious disease among women of Asian/Pacific Island descent. Analysis of NNDSS data provides information about the relative reported burden of diseases among women of all ages and different races.

These communities remain relatively separate from neighboring populations while maintaining close contact by travel with coreligionists in other cities. Epidemiologic investigations suggested community-to-community transmission via travel. Outbreak-related and control isolates of S. sonnei from each city were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to confirm an epidemiologic linkage between outbreaks. Forty-three (94%) of 46 outbreak-related isolates had closely related PFGE patterns, constituting a single subtype; 33 (94%) of 35 control isolates demonstrated unrelated PFGE patterns. Several patterns differing by < or = 3 bands were identified within the outbreak subtype; one of these accounted for 65% of outbreak isolates. Hence, a single subtype of S. sonnei caused an international outbreak involving 8 traditionally observant Jewish communities, but not neighboring populations, over a 2-year period, suggesting sustained propagation of the epidemic strain between communities.","['Sobel J', 'Cameron DN', 'Ismail J', 'Strockbine N', 'Williams M', 'Diaz PS', 'Westley B', 'Rittmann M', 'DiCristina J', 'Ragazzoni H', 'Tauxe RV', 'Mintz ED']",1998,177,5,J Infect Dis,"Sobel J, et al.

Between May 1996 and October 1996, in a prospective randomized double-blind trial, cefixime was compared with ampicillin-sulbactam, both given orally for a period of 5 days, for the treatment of 80 children with acute bloody diarrhea. Forty patients were treated with a single-dose (8 mg/kg per day) of cefixime and the other 40 patients were given three doses of 100 mg/kg per day of ampicillin-sulbactam. After identification of Shigella organisms in stool specimens, nine patients in the cefixime receiving group and six patients in the ampicillin-sulbactam receiving group were excluded from the study. Differences in average age, sex and weight between the cefixime and ampicillin-sulbactam group were statistically meaningless (P > 0.05). Fever and bloody diarrhea were universal features. The efficacy of cefixime was found to be better than ampicillin-sulbactam. Patients given cefixime had a shorter duration of fever (P < 0.01), shorter duration to disappearance of blood in the stool (P < 0.01), reduced time with diarrhea (P < 0.01) and reduced hospitalization time during the 5 study days (P < 0.01) than patients given ampicillin-sulbactam. No adverse effects were observed in the two study groups. This controlled trial showed good efficacy with cefixime compared to ampicillin-sulbactam in the treatment of shigellosis. Single-dose daily oral therapy with cefixime also showed good tolerability. Cefixime should be considered as an alternative drug of choice for shigellosis in children.","['Helvaci M', 'Bektaşlar D', 'Ozkaya B', 'Yaprak I', 'Umurtak B', 'Ertuğrul A']",1998,40,2,Acta Paediatr Jpn,"Helvaci M, et al.

9520472,"""Black holes"" and bacterial pathogenicity: a large genomic deletion that enhances the virulence of Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli.","Plasmids, bacteriophages, and pathogenicity islands are genomic additions that contribute to the evolution of bacterial pathogens. For example, Shigella spp., the causative agents of bacillary dysentery, differ from the closely related commensal Escherichia coli in the presence of a plasmid in Shigella that encodes virulence functions. However, pathogenic bacteria also may lack properties that are characteristic of nonpathogens. Lysine decarboxylase (LDC) activity is present in approximately 90% of E. coli strains but is uniformly absent in Shigella strains. When the gene for LDC, cadA, was introduced into Shigella flexneri 2a, virulence became attenuated, and enterotoxin activity was inhibited greatly. The enterotoxin inhibitor was identified as cadaverine, a product of the reaction catalyzed by LDC. Comparison of the S. flexneri 2a and laboratory E. coli K-12 genomes in the region of cadA revealed a large deletion in Shigella. Representative strains of Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive E. coli displayed similar deletions of cadA. Our results suggest that, as Shigella spp. evolved from E. coli to become pathogens, they not only acquired virulence genes on a plasmid but also shed genes via deletions. The formation of these ""black holes,"" deletions of genes that are detrimental to a pathogenic lifestyle, provides an evolutionary pathway that enables a pathogen to enhance virulence. Furthermore, the demonstration that cadaverine can inhibit enterotoxin activity may lead to more general models about toxin activity or entry into cells and suggests an avenue for antitoxin therapy. Thus, understanding the role of black holes in pathogen evolution may yield clues to new treatments of infectious diseases.","['Maurelli AT', 'Fernández RE', 'Bloch CA', 'Rode CK', 'Fasano A']",1998,95,7,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Maurelli AT, et al.

9567551,Multi-drug resistant typhoid fever with diarrhea.,"OBJECTIVE: To provide information about the characteristics of diarrheal stool in multi-drug resistant typhoid fever and observe the clinical course after treatment with furazolidone or ciprofloxacin.
SETTING: Hospital based.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty one male children who were positive for multi-drug resistant S. typhi by blood and stool cultures, having diarrhea at the time of hospitalization comprised the subjects. Serum and stool electrolytes were estimated. Stool samples were also processed to detect established enteropathogens, leukocytes and red blood cells. Children were treated either with furazolidone or ciprofloxacin and evaluated till recovery.
RESULTS: Mean (+/- SD) pre-admission duration of fever and diarrhea of these cases were 19.1 (+/- 5.6) and 15.8 (+/- 4.6) days, respectively. Stool character in 81% of the patients was watery with mean (+/- SD) volume of stool 51.4 (+/- 25.1) ml per kg body weight in the first 24 hours of observation. Leukocyte count varied between 20-49 per high power field in 66.7% stool samples. Occult blood was present in only 19% cases. Fecal red blood cells in high power field were detected in 52.4% cases. Mean fecal electrolytes (mmol/liter) were as follows: sodium-53.8, potassium-51.4, chloride-41.6 and total CO2-24.3. Most of the children (71.4%) had no dehydration and had normal serum electrolytes. The isolated strains of S. typhi were multi-drug resistant. These children were treated successfully either with furazolidone or ciprofloxacin.
CONCLUSION: The stools of multi-drug resistant typhoid fever patients were watery with little blood. Their electrolyte contents were more similar to the diarrheal stool seen in shigellosis rather than cholera. Uncontrolled observations revealed that children recovered with furazolidone or ciprofloxacin therapy.","['Dutta P', 'Mitra U', 'Rasaily R', 'Saha MR', 'Manna B', 'Chatterjee MK', 'Garai T', 'Sengupta M', 'Bhattacharya SK']",1997,34,10,Indian Pediatr,"Dutta P, et al.

9562989,Molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenicity.,"Cautious optimism has arisen over recent decades with respect to the long struggle against bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This has been offset, however, by a fatal complacency stemming from previous successes such as the development of antimicrobial drugs, the eradication of smallpox, and global immunization programs. Infectious diseases nevertheless remain the world's leading cause of death, killing at least 17 million persons annually [61]. Diarrheal diseases caused by Vibrio cholerae or Shigella dysenteriae kill about 3 million persons every year, most of them young children: Another 4 million die of tuberculosis or tetanus. Outbreaks of diphtheria in Eastern Europe threatens the population with a disease that had previously seemed to be overcome. Efforts to control infectious diseases more comprehensively are undermined not only by socioeconomic conditions but also by the nature of the pathogenic organisms itself; some isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter have become so resistant to drugs by horizontal gene transfer that they are almost untreatable. In addition, the mechanism of genetic variability helps pathogens to evade the human immune system, thus compromising the development of powerful vaccines. Therefore detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of microbial pathogenicity is absolutely necessary to develop new strategies against infectious diseases and thus to lower their impact on human health and social development.",['Fuchs TM'],1998,85,3,Naturwissenschaften,Fuchs TM.

More than 260,000 cases and a case fatality of four per thousand were reported in 1993. In late July 1994, the Health Services Department in Bulawayo was informed of two cases of Shigella dysenteriae type I at a textile factory that employs 138 workers. Workers were interviewed at the factory regarding the date of the onset of illness, symptoms, food consumed, and treatment received. Factory water supply, cooking, and sanitary facilities were inspected. Stool and water samples were obtained for analysis. A case was defined as an employee presenting with diarrhoea with onset from July 24 to August 25, 1994. Of the 99 workers on day and evening shifts, 75 (75%) were interviewed. Thirty eight workers met the case definition (Attack Rate 51%). Common symptoms were abdominal cramps (71%), and blood in stools (37%); median duration of diarrhoea was 11 days (range 5 to 32 days). Thirty seven (64%) of 58 workers who drank borehole water were ill compared to one (6%) of the 17 who did not (RR = 10.8, 95% CI = 1.6-73). No food items consumed were significantly associated with the illness. Two different shigella species (2 sonnei and 2 boydii) were isolated from five (13%) of 38 stool specimens. Water samples from the two boreholes yielded numerous faecal coliforms. Neither borehole was registered as required by the municipal bylaws, which also forbid use of borehole water for drinking. The epidemiologic and laboratory evidence implicate contaminated borehole water as the most likely cause of this outbreak.

Of 7993 miscellaneous specimens cultured, 80 yielded Salmonella and 147 Shigella. Serogroup B dominated among the salmonella, accounting for 61% of isolates, followed by S. typhi (21%). S. flexneri (58.5%) and S. dysenteriae (36.7%) were the most frequently isolated species among the Shigella. Results of sensitivity testing to five commonly used antibiotics in the area: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole, showed multiple drug resistance among the isolates of both salmonella and shigella. Only 4% of shigella were sensitive to all five antibiotics screened for in the study. Overall sensitive of shigella isolates to individual antibiotics was 8.8% to tetracycline, 10% to ampicillin, 28% to co-trimoxazole and 98% to gentamicin. No resistance was observed to nalidixic acid among 108 shigella strains tested for this antibiotic. The continued sensitivity of S. typhi to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, ampicillin and the other commonly used antibiotics is noted. It is recommended that nalidixic acid be introduced into the area under strict regulation for treatment of severe cases of shigella dysentery, an illness which is highly endemic in the region and the cause of occasional epidemics with high mortality.","['Aseffa A', 'Gedlu E', 'Asmelash T']",1997,74,11,East Afr Med J,"Aseffa A, et al.

9546597,Shigella dysenteriae type 1 toxin induced lipid peroxidation in enterocytes isolated from rabbit ileum.,"To evaluate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Shigella dysenteriae 1 toxin (STx) mediated intestinal infection, the ligated rabbit small intestinal loops were injected with STx. The enterocytes isolated from STx treated rabbit ileal loops had a significantly higher level of lipid peroxidation as compared to enterocytes isolated from control rabbit ileum. To study the role of second messengers in STx mediated intestinal damage, the in vivo and in vitro effects of modulators of lipid peroxidation of enterocytes were used. The presence of Ca2+-ionophore A23187 enhanced the extent of lipid peroxidation in enterocytes isolated from the control and STx treated rabbit ileum. However, 1-verapamil only marginally decreased the lipid peroxidation level of enterocytes isolated from STx treated rabbit ileum. The in vitro effect of modulators was in agreement with in vivo studies. Dantrolene significantly decreased the extent of lipid peroxidation of enterocytes isolated from STx treated rabbit ileum. PMA significantly increased the lipid peroxidation level of enterocytes isolated from control ileum. However, PMA could not further enhance the lipid peroxidation level of enterocytes isolated from STx treated rabbit ileum. The presence of H-7 significantly decreased the extent of lipid peroxidation of enterocytes isolated from STx treated rabbit ileum. In vitro effect of PMA and H-7 was in agreement with that of in vivo findings. The role of arachidonic acid metabolites, prostaglandins (PGs), in mediating STx induced lipid peroxidation was also studied. The presence of indomethacin (a PG synthesis inhibitor) significantly decreased the lipid peroxidation induced by STx. These findings suggest that lipid peroxidation induced by STx is mediated through cytosolic calcium. The increase in (Ca2+)i leads to activation of PKC. A significant decrease in the enterocyte levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione in STx treated rabbit ileum as compared to control was seen. A significant decrease in vitamin E levels was also observed. This suggests that there is decreased endogenous intestinal protection against ROS in STx mediated intestinal infection which could contribute to enterocyte membrane damage that ultimately leads to changes in membrane permeability and thus to fluid secretion.","['Kaur T', 'Singh S', 'Dhawan V', 'Ganguly NK']",1998,178,1-2,Mol Cell Biochem,"Kaur T, et al.

Furthermore, of 1524 strains received in 1995-1996, 46% were resistant to both of these antimicrobials. For Sh. sonnei almost 50% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin or trimethoprim and 15% were resistant to both of these antimicrobials. These results demonstrate that if antibiotic therapy had been indicated for infections with Sh. dysenteriae, Sh. flexneri, and Sh. boydii, then treatment with either ampicillin or trimethoprim may have been ineffective in almost 50% of cases and for Sh. sonnei, in 15% of cases. It is concluded that if it is necessary to commence treatment before the results of laboratory-based sensitivity tests are available, the best options would be to use nalidixic acid for children and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin, for adults.","['Cheasty T', 'Skinner JA', 'Rowe B', 'Threlfall EJ']",1998,4,1,Microb Drug Resist,"Cheasty T, et al.

9509179,Gastric acid secretion and enteric infection in Bangladesh.,"In developing countries many enteric infections are caused by acid-sensitive pathogens. Failure of the gastric acid barrier to infection has been reported in cholera but gastric acid secretion has been little studied in other enteric infections. We therefore studied basal and stimulated gastric acid in 185 Bangladeshi men admitted to hospital for the treatment of enteric infection. Patients with dysentery (amoebiasis, n = 24 and shigellosis, n = 19) and culture-negative diarrhoea (n = 69) had similar mean gastric acid levels (basal, 3-5 mmol/h; stimulated, 11-17 mmol/h), which remained stable in those patients studied throughout 12 weeks of convalescence. In contrast, patients with secretory diarrhoea caused by cholera or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) had low gastric acid levels (P < 0.05 compared with other groups) (cholera, n = 34: basal mean 1.8 mmol/h [SD = 2.2], stimulated mean 7.9 mmol/h [SD = 6.4]; ETEC, n = 39: basal mean 2.7 mmol/h [SD = 2.8], stimulated mean 9.4 mmol/h [SD = 7.5]). Cholera patients' gastric acid level rose during convalescence to similar levels to the dysentery patients'. Low gastric acid level was associated with severe disease in patients with cholera (P < 0.02) or ETEC (P < 0.05). Gastric acid level fell with increasing age (P < 0.007) but this did not account for the differences between groups. Gastric acid levels were not associated with Giardia duodenalis or Strongyloides stercoralis co-infection, fever, use of tobacco, or chewing betel nut. Cholera and secretory diarrhoea caused by ETEC may, therefore, partly result from a reduction in gastric acid level which does not occur during dysentery. Factors which impair gastric acid secretion may predispose to diarrhoeal disease in developing countries.","['Evans CA', 'Gilman RH', 'Rabbani GH', 'Salazar G', 'Ali A']",1997,91,6,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Evans CA, et al.

Travel can be associated with disease emergence because (1) the disease arises in an area of heavy tourism, (2) tourists may be at heightened risk because of their activities, or (3) because they can act as vectors to transport the agent to new areas. Examples of recently recognized diseases with relationship to travel include HIV, Legionnaire's disease, cyclosporiasis, Vibrio cholerae O139 Bengal, hantavirus, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. Reemerging diseases include dengue fever, malaria, cholera, schistosomiasis, leptospirosis, and viral hemorrhagic fevers.

Significantly more children in the vitamin A group than in the control group achieved clinical cure (19/42 (45%) v 8/14 (20%); chi 2 = 5.14, 1 df, P = 0.02; risk ratio = 0.68 (95% confidence interval; 0.50 to 0.93)). When cure was determined bacteriologically, the groups had similar rates (16/42 (38%) v 16/41 (39%); chi 2 = 0.02, 1 df, P = 0.89; risk ratio = 0.98 (0.70 to 1.39)).
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin A reduces the severity of acute shigellosis in children living in areas where vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem.","['Hossain S', 'Biswas R', 'Kabir I', 'Sarker S', 'Dibley M', 'Fuchs G', 'Mahalanabis D']",1998,316,7129,BMJ,"Hossain S, et al.

It was investigated 130 isolates of Sh. sonnei isolated from the stools of patients in 14 epidemics of bacillary dysentery in Yugoslav Army and citizens in period from 1987 to 1993 year. On the basis of identity of studied features of all isolates originated from one epidemic, epidemic strains of Sh. sonnei could be identified in 10 (71.4%) of 14 studied epidemics by means of plasmid profile, and in 8 (57.1%) epidemics by means of determination of resistance type to antibiotics. According to that, the method of plasmid profile analysis is more reliable in identification of Sh. sonnei epidemic strains compared to the method of determination of resistance type to antibiotics.","['Carević B', 'Bjelović M', 'Lepsanović Z', 'Jovanović M', 'Cobeljić M']",1997,54,6,Vojnosanit Pregl,"Carević B, et al.

9480034,[Toxic food infection caused by Shigella flexneri in a military unit].,"Food borne disease outbreaks have increased in France, but outbreaks caused by Shigella are rare, accounting for only 73 cases (1.62%) in 1993. We report a food borne outbreak of Shigella flexneri strain 3 infection in a fire fighting unit in Paris between July 13th and 17th 1995. Forty of the 127 firemen suffered symptoms including acute diarrhea (80%), fever (50%) and blood and mucus in stools (1 case, 2.5%). Epidemiological investigation generated an unimodal epidemic curve suggesting a single source of contamination with no secondary cases. The median incubation period was between 43 hours 30 minutes and 51 hours 30 minutes. This is consistent with food borne Shigella infection. Statistical analysis of a case-control study implicated a mixed salad containing frozen shellfish from Asia (shrimps and mussels), served at lunch and dinner on July 13th 1995. Shigella was not detected in this salad by microbiological methods. However, inoculation with as little as 100 organisms can cause symptoms. There was low-level contamination with Escherichia coli (940 cfu/g) due to cross-contamination. Shigella flexneri strain 3 was isolated from 11 of 18 stool cultures, but was never isolated from cultures of stools provided by the cooks. All isolates had identical antibiotic resistance profiles. They were resistant to ampicillin and ticarcillin, moderately sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, highly sensitive to aminosides, erythromycin and quinolones. This identical pattern in all isolates suggests a common source of contamination. Plasmid-based multiple resistance is common in this organism. Therefore, antibiotics should only be given to patients with evident clinical signs of infection. Treatment was symptom-based in all but 4 patients, who had acute diarrhea and were treated with ciprofloxacin. This antibiotic is well tolerated, has rapid bactericidal action and significantly reduces the duration of the symptoms and excretion of Shigella, thus preventing secondary contamination with this highly infectious bacterium. Thus, food borne outbreaks of Shigella can occur in countries with a high standard of living because of the increase in mass catering (e.g. fast food restaurants) and importation of foodstuffs from developing countries with endemic shigellosis. This is a public health problem because of the morbidity and absenteeism due to illness, particularly when the patients are firemen responsible for emergency management.","['Cheftel E', 'Spiegel A', 'Bornert G', 'Morell E', 'Michel A', 'Buisson Y']",1997,7,5,Sante,"Cheftel E, et al.

9475307,Absorption of macronutrients and nitrogen balance in children with dysentery fed an amylase-treated energy-dense porridge.,"The aim of this study was to determine the absorption of macronutrients and energy from an energy-dense diet liquefied with amylase from germinated wheat (ARF) in children suffering from acute dysentery. Thirty male children aged 6-35 months presenting with acute dysentery were randomly assigned to receive either an ARF-treated porridge or a standard porridge liquefied with water to make its consistency similar to the ARF porridge. After 24-h stabilization a 72-h metabolic balance was performed. Sixteen children received an ARF-treated porridge and 14 received a standard porridge liquefied with water. The mean +/- SD coefficients of absorption (%) of carbohydrate, fat, protein and energy (ARF porridge vs regular porridge) were 81.4 +/- 11 vs 86.9 +/- 7, 86.1 +/- 10 vs 82.8 +/- 15, 57.3 +/- 12 vs 48.4 +/- 24 and 81.4 +/- 9 vs 83.1 +/- 8, respectively. The stool loss of carbohydrate, protein, fat and energy was similar in the two groups. The net absorption of energy was substantially greater in the ARF-fed than regular porridge-fed children (by 28%, p = 0.01). The nitrogen balance was 6.9 +/- 3.4 mg kg(-1) d(-1) in the ARF porridge group and 1.1 +/- 6.7 mg kg(-1) d(-1) in the regular porridge group (p = 0.01). These results show that, despite being hyperosmolar, an amylase-treated liquefied energy-dense porridge is absorbed as well as a regular porridge by malnourished children with severe dysentery. Consequently, its use substantially increased the absorption of a net amount of macronutrients and resulted in a better nitrogen balance. These results further support this innovative approach of feeding sick children in developing countries.","['Rahman MM', 'Mahalanabis D', 'Ali M', 'Mazumder RN', 'Wahed MA', 'Fuchs GJ']",1997,86,12,Acta Paediatr,"Rahman MM, et al.

A retrospective record review over 2 years of all cases of dysentery, amoebiasis and diarrhoea was carried out in 13 healthcare facilities in the Rarieda Division of Nyanza province. Of the 3301 cases recorded, 2191 were dysentery, giving a cumulative 2 years incidence rate for dysentery of 4%. The epidemic began in December 1994 and peaked in February 1995, coinciding with the very dry season. One location in the area had an overall attack rate of 9.3%, double that of other locations. Highest rates were in children aged < 5 years and in persons > 15 years old. S. dysenteriae type 1, with its increasing multiantibiotic resistance, is a continuing threat to the health of people in this region; this area may be suitable for intensive, prospective surveillance as a prelude to a Shigella vaccine trial.","['Malakooti MA', 'Alaii J', 'Shanks GD', 'Phillips-Howard PA']",1997,91,5,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Malakooti MA, et al.

The examination of 96 patients and 20 healthy donors showed the possibility of the detection of S. flexneri 2a protein invasins and antibodies to them at different periods of the disease. During the severe course of shigellosis a higher level of protein invasins in the blood serum of patients was established in comparison with that observed during the medium severe course. An elevated level of protein invasins in the blood serum was accompanied by a lower content of specific antibodies to them, which was probably due to the immunosuppressive action of the invasiveness plasmid, established in earlier experiments.","['Bondarenko VM', 'Luchshev VI', 'Shakhmardanov MZ', 'Isaeva NP']",1997,,6,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Bondarenko VM, et al.

To determine the impact of such an approach, we examined results from 3977 specimens cultured by our laboratory. Epidemiological information was collected from physicians and the public health department. Salmonella spp. were identified in 74 specimens from 54 patients. Four Shigella spp. were recovered from four patients. Forty-seven of the 74 Salmonella spp. were recovered on both the primary xylose-lysine-deoxycholate (XLD) and after enrichment. No Salmonella or Shigella grew on the primary XLD only. Twenty-six Salmonella spp. were recovered only after selenite enrichment. Of these, 17 were from newly identified patients. The elimination of selenite enrichment would have significantly reduced our yield, whereas the elimination of the primary XLD would not have resulted in any fewer isolates and would have resulted in savings of approximately $4000 yearly.","['Forward KR', 'Rainnie BJ']",1997,29,4,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,Forward KR and Rainnie BJ.

Vigorous fluid administration was the primary therapy, complemented with antibiotics for patients with presumed Shigella infection. Recovery rates were 94% and 96% for patients with cholera and dysentery, respectively. Mortality was substantially affected by comorbid conditions such as pneumonia and meningitis, which occurred in one-quarter of these patients. Infective, metabolic, and surgical complications (including three cases of intussusception) may have contributed to the deaths. The outcome of patients during diarrheal epidemics of cholera or bacillary dysentery may be favorable, even in disaster settings, if patients are evacuated promptly to medical facilities and appropriate therapy is instituted.

9448926,Waterborne diseases of bacterial origin in relation to quality of water in a suburb of Uttar Pradesh.,"Waterborne disorders of bacterial origin, e.g. typhoid, bacillary dysentery and diarrhea are one of the major global health problems, especially in developing countries like India. The prevalence of these diseases is largely dependent on the quality of water consumed by people. The quality of water in India is still below the WHO recommendation of zero fecal coliform/100 ml of water. The present study was conducted in a suburb of Aligarh District of U.P. (India). A total of 1270 persons were selected by paying home visits and followed up for a period of one year. The study revealed that morbidity was higher in standpost group, i.e., 88.3% while in piped water group it was 51.8%. The average episode of typhoid for both source of water was one while dysentery had 3 average episodes. The average episodes of diarrhea was 4 in stand post and 3 in piped water group. In standpost group the majority of people, (87.6%) were using unsatisfactory water as compared to 74.4% for piped water supply. The frequency of typhoid was 1.4% bacillary dysentery 3.4% and diarrhea 7.7%. The occurrence of waterborne disorders of bacterial origin was common for typhoid in the 5-12 years age group bacillary dysentery for the 1-5 years, and diarrhea for the 0-5 years age group. The morbidity rate in standpost group was comparatively higher, i.e., 79.6%.

The present study surveyed the changing clinical and epidemiological characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility of Shigella gastroenteritis in Hacettepe University Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital Diarrhoea Training and Treatment Unit between 1987 and 1994. Among 19,812 diarrheal admissions, 618 (3.2%) patient files with Shigella gastroenteritis were reviewed retrospectively. Shigella soneii has been the commonest isolate (64%) since 1987 followed by S. flexineri (30%), S. boydii (5%) and S. dysenteriae (1%), the latter having not been isolated since 1990. The isolate rate of S. sonnei has increased whereas the isolation rate of S. flexineri has decreased concomitantly since 1987 (r = -0.94; P < 0.001). The majority of cases (365/618, 59%) were between 1 and 5 years of age. On admission bloody diarrhea was present in 36%, seizures in 3% and mild-moderate dehydration in 11% of cases. No case had severe dehydration. Only six patients (1%) were hospitalized. No deaths were recorded. The resistance rate for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has increased from 27% in 1990 to 66% in 1994 (P < 0.05) while the resistance rate for ampicillin has decreased from 81% in 1987 to 32% in 1993 (P < 0.001). Shigella flexineri was found to have higher resistance rates to ampicillin, sulbactam-ampicillin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin than S. sonnei. Changing Shigella sp. over the years may be the reason for the mild course of Shigella gastroenteritis.

9421771,Nosocomial transmission of Shigella dysenteriae type 1.,"An outbreak of dysentery due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1 occurred in a chronic care psychiatric institution in Durban, South Africa. Of the 10 patients who developed dysentery, 4 (40%) died. S. dysenteriae type 1 was isolated from stool samples from two of the four patients tested and ribotyping showed that these isolates were identical but differed from other community acquired strains. The isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole. Infection control measures including isolation, cohort nursing and strict hand disinfection resulted in rapid control of the outbreak.","['Pillay DG', 'Karas JA', 'Pillay A', 'Sturm AW']",1997,37,3,J Hosp Infect,"Pillay DG, et al.

9393841,"Identification of shuA, the gene encoding the heme receptor of Shigella dysenteriae, and analysis of invasion and intracellular multiplication of a shuA mutant.","shuA encodes a 70-kDa outer membrane heme receptor in Shigella dysenteriae. Analysis of the shuA DNA sequence indicates that this gene encodes a protein with homology to TonB-dependent receptors of gram-negative bacteria. Transport of heme by the ShuA protein requires TonB and its accessory proteins ExbB and ExbD. The shuA DNA sequence contains a putative Fur box overlapping the -10 region of a potential shuA promoter, and the expression of shuA is repressed by exogenous iron or hemin in a Fur-dependent manner, although hemin repressed expression to a lesser extent than iron salts. Disruption of this open reading frame on the S. dysenteriae chromosome by marker exchange yielded a strain that failed to use heme as an iron source, indicating that shuA is essential for heme transport in S. dysenteriae. However, shuA is not essential for invasion or multiplication within cultured Henle cells; the shuA mutant invaded and produced normal plaques in confluent cell monolayers.","['Mills M', 'Payne SM']",1997,65,12,Infect Immun,"Mills M and Payne SM.

9393811,"The interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme, caspase 1, is activated during Shigella flexneri-induced apoptosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages.","Shigella, the etiological agent of bacillary dysentery, rapidly kills human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro. Wild-type Shigella flexneri, but not a nonvirulent derivative, induced human macrophage apoptosis as determined by morphology and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). Shigella-mediated macrophage cell death was blocked by the peptide inhibitors of caspases, acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (acetyl-YVAD-CHO) and acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone (acetyl-YVAD-CMK). Protection from apoptosis by YVAD was observed in monocytes matured in the presence or absence of colony-stimulating factors (CSF) like macrophage-CSF or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) rendered human macrophages partially resistant to Shigella cytotoxicity. Macrophages stimulated with either LPS or IFN-gamma were also protected by YVAD from Shigella-induced cell death. During Shigella infections of human macrophages, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) was cleaved to the mature form. IL-1beta maturation was severely retarded by YVAD, indicating that IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE; caspase 1) is activated in Shigella-induced apoptosis. The finding that Shigella induces apoptosis in human macrophages by activating ICE supports the hypothesis that the acute inflammation characteristic of shigellosis is initially triggered by apoptotic macrophages which release mature IL-1beta during programmed cell death.","['Hilbi H', 'Chen Y', 'Thirumalai K', 'Zychlinsky A']",1997,65,12,Infect Immun,"Hilbi H, et al.

Stools from 29,587 persons were bacteriologically examined. Various enteropathogenic bacteria were isolated from 9,766 (33.0%) patients of the stools examined. Isolated species were as follows: Plesiomonas shigelloides (3,234 cases); Salmonella spp. (2,236 cases); enterotoxgenic Escherichia coli (1,621 cases); Vibrio parahaemolyticus (1,959 cases); and Shigella spp. (1,242 cases). 1,278 different Shigella strains were isolated from 1,242 cases who were thus diagnosed as bacillary dysentery patients. The suspected regions or countries for infection of these cases were analysed. The serovars and antibiotic-sensitivities of the isolated strains were examined.

We show that in the developed as well as the developing world, there is consistent evidence of a protective effect of exclusive breast feeding in the first 4-6 months of life. The odds ratios were generally in excess of 3.0 for non-breast milk feeds. The relationship was not consistent for rotavirus infections but was consistently strong for non-viral pathogens. There are a number of indicators that suggest biological plausibility, in both the developing and developed world. The triple indicators of consistency and strength of the epidemiological associations, together with biological plausibility are major arguments for believing that there is a causal sequence involved.","['Golding J', 'Emmett PM', 'Rogers IS']",1997,49 Suppl,,Early Hum Dev,"Golding J, et al.

9377178,[Molecular and cellular bases of intestinal epithelial cell invasion by Shigella flexneri].,"A key step in the pathogenesis of shigellosis is the capacity of the causative bacteria, shigellae, to invade colonic and rectal epithelial cells in humans. This invasive process encompasses several steps: entry into epithelial cells by induction of a macropinocytic event caused by secreted Ipa proteins. the bacterium then escapes from the vacuole and reaches the cytoplasmic compartment in which it divides rapidly and becomes motile via the expression of a surface protein, IcsA, whose polar localization achieves directed polymerization of actin filaments that push the bacterial body forward. Bacteria then engage the inner face of the cellular membrane in the junctional area and form protrusions allowing their passage into the adjacent cell. Lysis of the double membrane eventually allows access to the cytoplasmic compartment of the adjacent cell, thus providing the bacterium with a very efficient mechanism of epithelial colonization.",['Sansonetti PJ'],1997,320,9,C R Acad Sci III,Sansonetti PJ.
