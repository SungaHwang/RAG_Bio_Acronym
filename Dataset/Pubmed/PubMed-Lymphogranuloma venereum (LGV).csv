37875628,"Epidemiological Characteristics and Factors Associated with Repeat Sexually Transmitted Infections in Barcelona, Spain Over a Decade.","In the last few years, the frequency of sexually transmitted infections (STI) has increased, as has the number of people with multiple infections. The aim of our study was to describe the epidemiological characteristics of persons with repeated bacterial STI and to determine the risk factors for these episodes in persons living in Barcelona during the period 2007-2018. We studied all cases of bacterial STI included in the STI registry of Barcelona. Repeated STI were defined as a diagnosis of gonorrhea, syphilis, or lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) after a first episode of one of these infections. Analysis was stratified by sex and place of birth. The factors associated with time to reinfection were determined by Kaplan-Meier estimates, while the factors associated with risk of infection were determined by a Cox proportional hazards model. Of 9927 persons with a diagnosis of bacterial STI, 1690 (17.0%) had at least two episodes of STI during the study period. On multivariate analysis, repeat STI were independently associated with male sex assigned at birth (HR: 3.45; 95%CI 2.22-5.36), age less than 34 years (HR: 1.22; 95%CI 1.10-1.35); gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, and transgender o transsexual woman (GBSMS/Trans) (HR: 4.03; 95%CI 3.24-5.03), having gonorrhea as first diagnosis (HR:1.49, 95%CI 1.34-1.66) or LGV (HR:1.75; 95%CI 1.47-2.08) and coinfection with HIV (HR:1.98; 95%CI 1.78-2.21). Sexual health programs should be strengthened to prevent STI and reinfection in key populations.","['Jacques-Aviñó C', 'Alarcón Guitiérrez M', 'Barbera MJ', 'Fuertes I', 'Martin-Ezquerra G', 'Lopez-Contreras J', 'Vives Á', 'Rodriguez R', 'Ros M', 'Rius C', 'de Olalla PG']",2023,,,Arch Sex Behav,"Jacques-Aviñó C, et al.

37749973,Swelling of inguinal lymph nodes in a patient with HIV: a case report.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the L1, L2, and L3 serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). It primarily affects regional lymph nodes. Although it is not endemic in Europe and North America, recent reports indicate an increasing prevalence among men who have sex with men, with proctocolitis as the most frequently reported symptom. We report the case of a homosexual male that presented to our department with a nodular lesion on the shaft of the penis and tender, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. Throat, urethral, and rectal swabs were collected for CT testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The urethral swab was positive for CT, whereas the throat and rectal swabs were negative. Subsequent testing detected the presence of LGV DNA. The patient was treated with a prolonged course of doxycycline. After 6 weeks, the urethral swab for CT returned a negative result. The patient reported complete remission 7 weeks after the start of treatment.","['Bartenjev MS', 'Mastnak M', 'Keše D', 'Murnik Rauh A']",2023,32,3,Acta Dermatovenerol Alp Pannonica Adriat,"Bartenjev MS, et al.

37335757,Sexually transmitted infections in Spain: Current status.,"Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) are a major public health problem. The problems inherent to their diagnosis, treatment and prevention have to do not only with their nature, but also with organizational issues and overlapping competencies of the different health authorities in Spain. The real situation of STI in Spain, at present, is poorly known. For this reason, the Scientific Committee on COVID and Emerging Pathogens of the Illustrious Official College of Physicians of Madrid (ICOMEM) has formulated a series of questions on this subject which were distributed, not only among the members of the Committee, but also among experts outside it. The central health authorities provide very high and increasing figures for gonococcal infection, syphilis, Chlamydia trachomatis infection and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Both HIV infection and Monkeypox are two important STI caused by viruses in our environment, to which it should be added, mainly, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Emerging microorganisms such as Mycoplasma genitalium pose not only pathogenic challenges but also therapeutic problems, as in the case of N. gonohrroeae. The pathways that patients with suspected STI follow until they are adequately diagnosed and treated are not well known in Spain. Experts understand that this problem is fundamentally managed in public health institutions, and that Primary Care and Hospital Emergency Services, together with some institutions that deal monographically with this problem, are the recipients of most of these patients. One of the most serious difficulties of STI lies in the availability of the microbiological tests necessary for their diagnosis, particularly in this era of outsourcing of microbiology services. Added to this is the increased cost of implementing the latest generation of molecular techniques and the difficulties of transporting samples. It is clear that STI are not diseases to which the entire population is equally exposed and it is necessary to have a better knowledge of the risk groups where to focus the necessary interventions adapted to their characteristics. It should not be forgotten that STI are also a problem in the pediatric age group and that their presence can be a marker of sexual abuse with all that this implies in terms of health care and medicolegal activity. Finally, STI are infections that are associated with a high cost of care for which we have very little information. The possibility of expanding the automatic performance of laboratory tests for STI surveillance through laboratory routines is encountering ethical and legal problems that are not always easy to solve. Spain has created a ministerial area of specific attention to STI and there are plans to improve the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these problems, but we still lack the necessary evidence on their impact. We cannot forget that these are diseases that transcend the individual and constitute a Public Health problem.","['Del Romero J', 'Moreno Guillén S', 'Rodríguez-Artalejo FJ', 'Ruiz-Galiana J', 'Cantón R', 'De Lucas Ramos P', 'García-Botella A', 'García-Lledó A', 'Hernández-Sampelayo T', 'Gómez-Pavón J', 'González Del Castillo J', 'Martín-Delgado MC', 'Martín Sánchez FJ', 'Martínez-Sellés M', 'Molero García JM', 'Gómez Castellá J', 'Palomo M', 'García Berrio R', 'Couso González A', 'Sotomayor C', 'Bouza E']",2023,36,5,Rev Esp Quimioter,"Del Romero J, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2020 to April 2022, MSM coming for anonymous voluntary counseling and testing, for pre-exposure prophylaxis, and for antiretroviral therapy were enrolled. All participants submitted his fecal samples and completed a QR-code questionnaire. Medical records of those who took regular medical visits for HIV were recorded. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for all fecal samples, and ompA gene sequencing was therefore performed for each Chlamydia-positive fecal sample.
RESULTS: Among 341 MSM during 2020-2022 in southern Taiwan, 21 (6.2%) had rectal chlamydia infection. Risk factors of rectal chlamydia included co-infection with rectal gonorrhea (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 6.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-31.91, P = 0.015) and multiple sexual partners (AOR 1.373, 95% CI 1.002-1.882, P = 0.048). Further ompA gene sequencing from 19 Chlamydia-positive fecal samples revealed that the prevalent genotypes or genovariants were Da (26.3%) and L2b (26.3%), followed by B (21.1%), J (14.3%), and G (9.5%). All cases of rectal LGV genovariant L2b presented as acute proctitis with diarrhea, anal pain, or discharge and were treated successfully with prolonged treatment of doxycycline.
CONCLUSIONS: Rectal gonorrhea and multiple sexual partners are risk factors for rectal chlamydia. Clinicians in Taiwan should be aware of the emerging threat of rectal LGV among MSM with acute proctitis.","['Tsai CS', 'Chen PL', 'Lee NY', 'Tsai HP', 'Huang SH', 'Chen SY', 'Tang YW', 'Lin YC', 'Tsai PF', 'Mao LW', 'Su SL', 'Wang JL', 'Ko WC']",2023,56,2,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Tsai CS, et al.

36605505,Specific high-resolution scheme to improve understanding of the spatio-temporal dispersion of lymphogranuloma venereum epidemic.,"INTRODUCTION: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is already endemic in vulnerable populations in several European countries; however, molecular epidemiology data with improved accuracy are necessary to better understand LGV epidemic in these countries. Current strategies to study the molecular epidemiology of LGV cases involve schemes based on a few genetic fragments of 
METHODS: Four genes were selected according to their diversity index (CTLon_0054, CTLon_0087, CTLon_0243 and CTLon_0301) for use in combination with 
RESULTS: Our proposal demonstrated higher diversity allowing the identification of three main groups compared to the previously published MLST based on hypervariable genes wherein only a single sequence type was identified. The temporal analysis showed that the major cluster was progressively diversifying, revealing a very active transmission chain. Furthermore, an L2b genome identical to that of the origin of the epidemic was detected, suggesting reintroductions or a low screening rate in vulnerable populations. The spatial distribution suggests that the selection and spread of new variants occurs from the central district to the peripheral regions.
DISCUSSION: The scheme proposed in this study has proven to be useful for appropriate discrimination of LGV strains. This study, to our knowledge for the first time, demonstrates a spatio-temporal spread that increases our understanding and identifies areas with special susceptibility for maintenance of the endemic situation of LGV.","['Martínez-García L', 'González-Alba JM', 'Puerta T', 'Comunión A', 'Rodríguez-Jiménez MC', 'Orviz E', 'Sánchez-Conde M', 'Rodríguez-Domínguez M', 'Cantón R', 'Galán JC']",2022,13,,Front Microbiol,"Martínez-García L, et al.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that HIV infection, anorectal bleeding and oro-anal sex are independent predictors of LGV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with anorectal symptoms, LGV serovars predominate over non-LGV ones. Clinical manifestations are not pathognomonic of a specific biovar. If genotyping is not available, having clinical predictors may help to presume an LGV infection and define length of treatment.","['La Rosa L', 'Svidler López L', 'Entrocassi AC', 'López Aquino D', 'Caffarena D', 'Büttner KA', 'Gallo Vaulet ML', 'Rodríguez Fermepin M']",2021,32,14,Int J STD AIDS,"La Rosa L, et al.

34237111,High-resolution genotyping of Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV) strains of Chlamydia trachomatis in London using multi-locus VNTR analysis-ompA genotyping (MLVA-ompA).,"BACKGROUND: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis strains with ompA genotypes L1 to L3. An LGV epidemic associated with the L2b genotype has emerged in the past few decades amongst men who have sex with men (MSM). C. trachomatis genotypes can be discriminated by outer membrane protein A gene (ompA) sequencing, however this method has limited resolution. This study employed a high-resolution genotyping method, namely, multi-locus tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis with ompA sequencing (MLVA-ompA), to assess the distribution of LGV MLVA-ompA genotypes amongst individuals attending genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in London.
METHODS: Clinical specimens were collected from individuals attending eight London-based GUM clinics. Specimens that tested positive for C. trachomatis by commercial nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were confirmed as LGV by pmpH real-time PCR. LGV-positive DNA extracts were subsequently genotyped using MLVA-ompA.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty DNA extracts were confirmed as LGV, and 162 (70%) yielded complete MLVA-ompA genotypes. Six LGV MLVA-ompA genotypes were identified: 1.9.2b-L2, 1.9.3b-L2b, 1.9.2b-L2b, 1.9.2b-L2b/D, 1.4a.2b-L2b, and 5.9.2b-L1. The following LGV ompA genotypes were identified (in descending order of abundance): L2, L2b, L2b/D, and L1. Eight ompA sequences with the hybrid L2b/D profile were detected. The hybrid sequence was identical to the ompA of a recombinant L2b/D strain detected in Portugal in 2017.
CONCLUSIONS: The L2 ompA genotype was found to predominate in the London study population. The study detected an unusual hybrid L2b/D ompA profile that was previously reported in Portugal. We recommend further monitoring and surveillance of LGV strains within the UK population.","['Manning C', ""O'Neill C"", 'Clarke IN', 'Rebec M', 'Cliff PR', 'Marsh P']",2021,16,7,PLoS One,"Manning C, et al.

35979244,Lymphogranuloma Venereum-Associated Proctitis Mimicking a Malignant Rectal Neoplasia: Searching for Diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: None
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 48-year-old Caucasian male with no significant previous medical history who was admitted due to the suspicion of a rectal neoplasia. He underwent an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before admission due to complaints of anorectal pain, hematochezia, and constipation over the previous 2 weeks. The examination revealed a circumferential rectal wall thickening, infiltration of the perirectal fat and invasion of the mesorectal fascia, associated with perirectal fat lymphadenopathy. A radiological diagnosis of a rectal malignant neoplasia staged as T4N2MX was stated. Digital rectal examination identified a circumferential rectal tumor. Rectosigmoidoscopy showed an extensive and circumferential ulceration of the rectal mucosa, with elevated geographical borders, exudate, and aphthoid erosions at the proximal limit of the endoscopic mucosal ulceration. Biopsy specimens revealed acute ulcerative proctitis with lymphoplasmocytic inflammatory infiltrate but no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. A STI screening was positive for HIV-1 (CD4+ 251/mm
DISCUSSION: LGV-associated proctitis, often undervalued, is a reemerging disease which should always be considered a benign cause of rectal mass, in order to avoid delay in diagnosis and development of complications. Diagnosis becomes more challenging in patients with unknown HIV status. A detailed clinical history, including sexual behaviors, is a vital step to achieve the final diagnosis.","['Pimentel R', 'Correia C', 'Estorninho J', 'Gravito-Soares E', 'Gravito-Soares M', 'Figueiredo P']",2022,29,4,GE Port J Gastroenterol,"Pimentel R, et al.

33896044,Lymphogranuloma venereum: a retrospective analysis of an emerging sexually transmitted disease in a Lisbon Tertiary Center.,"BACKGROUND: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexual transmitted infection (STI), currently endemic within the population of men who have sex with men (MSM) of Western Countries. L2B variant has been reported as the predominant strain in the current LGV epidemics, although a shift towards L2-434 has been observed in some European countries.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and characterize the population with LGV infection diagnosed in Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Central, Lisbon, Portugal.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all LGV diagnoses between 2016 and 2019 was performed. The diagnosis was established through ompA-genotyping of samples yielding a positive result to Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). All considered samples were retrieved from the clinician activity, through swabbing and urine analysis and CT infection diagnosis was obtained using real-time PCR.
RESULTS: During the period studied 16 279 CT diagnostics tests were employed, with a striking increase from 2016 (n = 467) to 2019 (n = 9362). A total of 1602 diagnoses of CT were established, from which 168 (10.5%) corresponded to LGV, with both infections showing a rising evolution, between 2016 and 2019, of 2.9 and 2.7 times, respectively. The majority of the LGV strains were genotyped as L2/434 (67.3%; n = 113). LGV predominantly affected MSM and men who have sex with men and women (97.0%; n = 163). Anorectal infection was the most prevalent one (90.5%; n = 152), being proctitis the main clinical presentation (76.2%; n = 128). Absence of symptoms was reported in almost 15% of the cases (n = 24). The presence of concomitant infection with human immunodeficiency virus was dominant (73.2%; n = 123) and the prevalence of one or more STI co-infections was about 60.1% (n = 99).
CONCLUSIONS: An increasing evolution of CT and LGV testing and diagnosing was observable throughout the studied period. Characteristics of the population are similar with those described within LGV epidemics. In accordance with recent European studies, predominance towards L2 genotype was identified.","['Neves JM', 'Ramos Pinheiro R', 'Côrte-Real R', 'Borrego MJ', 'Rodrigues A', 'Fernandes C']",2021,35,8,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Neves JM, et al.

However, diagnosing LGV in a hospital setting is rare. We analysed the diagnostic process and clinical characteristics of patients with LGV in a hospital setting.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective observational study conducted in a teaching hospital in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. All adult patients with LGV between November 2010 and February 2019 were included. Clinical data were retrieved from electronic patient records.
RESULTS: 40 patients were included. 90% of patients were men who have sex with men (MSM) and 62,5% were HIV positive. The most common presenting symptoms were rectal bleeding (47,5%), anal symptoms (30%) and change in bowel habits (25%). The mean time from first consultation to diagnosis was 28 days (range: 0 to 332, median 16,5 days). Diagnostic delay was increased by clinical presentation (ie anogenital syndrome) and the number of specialists involved. Diagnostic procedures not leading to the diagnosis were performed in 98% of cases.
CONCLUSION: To prevent late complications, unnecessary diagnostic procedures and further transmission, early testing for LGV should be incorporated in the work-up of every patient reporting MSM-activity presenting with anorectal symptoms or inguinal lymphadenopathy.","['Bosma JW', 'van Tienhoven AJ', 'Thiesbrummel HF', 'de Vries H', 'Veenstra J']",2021,32,6,Int J STD AIDS,"Bosma JW, et al.

33462582,Effective Treatment of Lymphogranuloma venereum Proctitis With Azithromycin.,"BACKGROUND: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) serovars L1, L2, and L3 and is endemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Europe. We evaluated weekly oral azithromycin 1 g for 3 weeks as a treatment for LGV proctitis.
METHODS: This is an open clinical trial with convenience allocation according to treating physician preferences. Adults with clinical proctitis received a single dose of 1 g of intramuscular ceftriaxone and were subsequently allocated to receive (i) doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 21 days (Doxycycline group) or (ii) azithromycin 1 g orally once weekly for 3 weeks (Azithromycin group). LGV cure (primary endpoint) was defined as resolution of symptoms at week 6 (clinical cure, LGV-CC), with an additional supporting negative rectal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at week 4 (microbiological cure, LGV-MC), if available.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five individuals with LGV clinical proctitis were included. All were MSM, and 96% were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Eighty-two were in the Azithromycin group, and 43 were in the Doxycycline group. LGV cure on a modified intention-to-treat analysis (primary endpoint), occurred in 80 of 82 (98%) in the Azithromycin group versus 41 of 43 (95%) in the Doxycycline group (treatment difference [95% confidence interval {CI}] 2.2% [-3.2, 13.2]). LGV-MC occurred in 70 of 72 (97%) vs 15 of 15 (100%) in the Azithromycin group and Doxycycline group, respectively (treatment difference [95% CI] -2.8% [-9.6; 17.7]). Adverse events were similar in both treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support extended azithromycin dosing as an alternative treatment option for symptomatic LGV proctitis and provides the rationale for future randomized trials.","['Blanco JL', 'Fuertes I', 'Bosch J', 'De Lazzari E', 'Gonzalez-Cordón A', 'Vergara A', 'Blanco-Arevalo A', 'Mayans J', 'Inciarte A', 'Estrach T', 'Martinez E', 'Cranston RD', 'Gatell JM', 'Alsina-Gibert M']",2021,73,4,Clin Infect Dis,"Blanco JL, et al.

33044320,Did Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Roll-Out Influence the Epidemic of Rectal Lymphogranuloma Venereum in Belgium? Results From the National Surveillance System.,"BACKGROUND: An increase of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in HIV negative men who have sex with men is reported in several European countries including Belgium before the implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
SETTING: The epidemiological characteristics of the male rectal LGV epidemic in Belgium were explored before and after the introduction of PrEP.
METHODS: Segmented regression models were used to examine a change in trends before and after the introduction of PrEP in the male rectal LGV epidemic in Belgium and among men attending a large HIV/sexually transmitted infection clinic in Antwerp, Belgium.
RESULTS: Although an increase of 69% was noted in absolute numbers in 2019 compared with 2018 (140 vs 83 cases) in Belgium, models showed that the rate of increase did not change after the introduction of PrEP. More than half of the cases were found in HIV-negative men (56.2%) in 2019, but no difference in the magnitude of the trend was found after the introduction of PrEP. Nevertheless, the data reveal that a statistical significant increase of LGV prevalence was noted among non-HIV-positive men in an HIV/sexually transmitted infection clinic after the implementation of PrEP. Indeed, LGV prevalence in the Antwerp male PrEP cohort increased from 0.8% in 2017 to 2.4% in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The trend of LGV increase did not accelerate after the introduction of PrEP.

32871127,Lymphogranuloma Venereum in a Public Health Service Hospital in Southern Spain: A Clinical and Epidemiologic Study.,"UNLABELLED: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is an emerging disease in men who have sex with men (MSM): the incidence was 1.15 cases per 100,000 population in Spain in 2017. Patients with LGV characteristically have severe proctitis that can cause abscesses, fistulas, and anal stenosis. Genital ulcers and inflammatory inguinal adenopathy may occasionally be present. The aim of this study was to describe a series of patients with LGV treated in a public health service hospital in Andalusia, Spain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective, observational description of a series of patients diagnosed with LGV. We gathered epidemiologic, clinical, microbiologic, and treatment data. Patients' sexual behaviors were also noted.
RESULTS: We found 17 cases of LGV diagnosed in MSM between October 2016 and May 2019. Twelve of the patients were also infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, and 13 had severe proctitis with ulcers in the anal canal and rectum. Four patients had genital or inguinal manifestations. The following high-risk sexual behaviors were on record: a high number of sexual partners, receptive anal sex with strangers and without a condom, seeking sexual partners online, participation in group sex, and sex with partners from outside Andalusia. Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 was identified in all cases, and the infection responded well to oral doxycycline. Two patients with the most characteristic form of LGV required longer treatment cycles. Three required surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: When symptomatic proctitis is found in MSM who engage in high-risk sex, the LGV exudate should be sampled and the C trachomatis serovar identified. Genital ulcers or inguinal buboes are also highly suggestive of LGV. Clinical suspicion and early treatment are the keys to preventing complications and disease transmission.","['Repiso-Jiménez JB', 'Millán-Cayetano JF', 'Salas-Márquez C', 'Correa-Ruiz A', 'Rivas-Ruiz F']",2020,111,9,Actas Dermosifiliogr (Engl Ed),"Repiso-Jiménez JB, et al.

While immunohistochemical stains are available for syphilis, there is no commonly available stain for the tissue identification of CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 200 positive CT nucleic acid tests (NAT) from anorectal swabs, we identified 12 patients with biopsies collected from the distal colorectum or anus within 90 days of the positive NAT. We collected basic demographic information and tabulated clinical and histological findings. We examined the performance of a novel RNA in-situ hybridisation (ISH) stain targeting CT 23s rRNA on these 12 cases and 10 controls from the anorectum.
RESULTS: All 12 patients were male; nine were HIV+, two had concurrent gonococcal infection, one had concurrent syphilis and one had cytomegalovirus co-infection. The majority of biopsies (11 of 12) showed mild or moderate acute inflammation, had a prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (eight of 11) and lacked marked crypt distortion (10 of 10). The RNA ISH stain was positive in 10 of 12 cases (sensitivity 83%). One case showed equivocal staining. No controls showed definitive positive staining (specificity 100%). One had equivocal staining.
CONCLUSION: Our series showed that anorectal LGV had similar histological findings to those of prior STI proctitis series predominantly comprised of syphilis. The novel RNA ISH stain was sensitive and specific and may show utility in differentiating types of STI proctitis.","['Waters KM', 'Cox BK', 'Wong MT', 'Guindi M', 'Kim SA', 'Larson BK', 'Morgan M', 'Voltaggio L', 'Balzer BL']",2021,78,3,Histopathology,"Waters KM, et al.

32771642,Evaluation of four commercial real-time PCR assays for the detection of lymphogranuloma venereum in Chlamydia trachomatis-positive anorectal samples.,"OBJECTIVES: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) genovars L. The identification of LGV is of therapeutic interest because treatment requires 3 weeks of doxycycline compared with 1 week for infection with a non-L strain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of four commercial real-time PCR kits in comparison with the reference methods used for LGV diagnosis by the French National Reference Centre (NRC) for bacterial STIs.
METHODS: A total of 215 French CT-positive anorectal specimens collected consecutively in 2017 were used (66 LGV and 149 non-LGV). Among these, 92 were collected from symptomatic men who have sex with men (MSM) and 123 from asymptomatic MSM using pre-exposure prophylaxis. Four commercial assays were evaluated; a single-plex assay RealCycler CHSL kit (Progenie Molecular), tested on all the specimens, and three multiplex kits, the RealCycler Universal ULCGEN (Progenie Molecular), the Allplex Genital Ulcer Assay (Seegene) and the VIASURE Haemophilus ducreyi + CT LGV Real Time PCR Detection kit (CerTest Biotec), tested on the 92 samples from symptomatic MSM. Clinical performance was determined in comparison to the in-house real time PCR targeting the pmpH and the ompA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: Overall agreement ranged between 91.3% and 100% (95% CI 83.7-100%) with very good Kappa index values (>0.8). The clinical sensitivities and specificities varied between 91% and 100% (95% CI 80.8-100%), and 97% and 100% (95% CI 87.1-100%), respectively, with some kits performing better than others.
DISCUSSION: The four assays showed very good performance for the detection of LGV on anorectal specimens.","['Touati A', 'Laurier-Nadalié C', 'Bébéar C', 'Peuchant O', 'de Barbeyrac B']",2021,27,6,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Touati A, et al.

32762828,Investigating the decline in Lymphogranuloma venereum diagnoses in men who have sex with men in the United Kingdom since 2016: an analysis of surveillance data.,"UNLABELLED: Background Following an upward trajectory in Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) diagnoses in the UK from 2004 to 2016, with annual diagnoses increasing from 28 to 904, diagnoses fell to 641 in 2017; this was inconsistent with the upward trend in other bacterial sexually transmissible infections (STIs) between 2016 and 2017. An analysis of surveillance data from multiple sources to investigate the possible factors contributing to this decline in LGV was performed.
METHODS: LGV tests and diagnoses in the UK from 2004 to 2018 were captured through laboratory data from the LGV Reference Laboratories and laboratories conducting in-house LGV testing. These data and clinical diagnoses data from England were analysed alongside the national management guidelines issued over the course of the epidemic.
RESULTS: LGV diagnoses increased between 2004 and 2015 and then decreased between 2016 and 2018. LGV testing increased from 2010 to 2018 (2690-10850). Test positivity halved between 2015 (14.8%, 929-6272) and 2018 (7.3%, 791-10850). Peaks in LGV testing and diagnoses appeared to coincide with the publication of national LGV management guidelines and changes to clinical practice. The proportion of LGV diagnoses among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) fell between 2013 and 2018 (74-48%).
CONCLUSIONS: The fall in diagnoses and positivity were likely due to increasing earlier clinical diagnosis and treatment. Changes to the national management guidelines, the clinical policy and practice of some larger clinics and potentially changes to the guidelines for the treatment of chlamydia broadened the scope of testing and increased testing in asymptomatic patients which, in combination, likely had a positive effect on the control of LGV infection.","['Allen H', 'Pitt R', 'Bardsley M', 'Smolarchuk C', 'Sullivan A', 'Mohammed H', 'Cole M', 'Fifer H', 'Wallace L', 'Thomas D', 'Irvine N', 'Templeton K', 'Hughes G', 'Simms I']",2020,17,4,Sex Health,"Allen H, et al.

32497069,Reduction of non-typeable results using a plasmid oriented Lymfogranuloma venereum PCR for typing of Chlamydia trachomatis positive samples.,"OBJECTIVES: Typing of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is traditionally performed by characterising the ompA gene, resulting in more than a dozen different genovars, A to L. Type L is associated with Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and commonly screened for using PCR, targeting the chromosomal pmpH gene. We aimed to develop and validate a new CT/LGV plasmid-based typing assay targeting the pgp3 gene, to increase sensitivity and thus reduce the number of non-typeable results.
METHODS: The new pgp3 PCR assay using LNA probes to detect point mutations was analytically and prospectively validated in a routine diagnostic laboratory setting. For the analytical tests, quantified nucleotide constructs (gBlocks) were used to perform limit of detection analyses. Quality control panel samples from 2018 and 2019 for CT were also tested. For the clinical study patient samples which were collected in two months in 2018 were tested simultaneously using the pmpH PCR and the pgp3 PCR.
RESULTS: Analytically, the assay proved to be 100% specific relative to the previously used LGV typing assay targeting the single copy pmpH gene but it was much more sensitive to detect non-LGV CT. In the quality control panel 2 nonLGV samples and 7 LGV samples were solely positive with the pgp3 PCR and not with the pmpH PCR. None of the samples from analytical specificity panels were positive, indicating 100% specificity. In a prospective panel of 152 clinical samples, 142 (93%) were successfully typed with the pgp3 PCR compared to 78% with the pmpH PCR. The pgp3 PCR was fully concordant with the pmpH PCR to identify all LGV subtypes and detected an increased number of clinical samples of non-LGV subtype.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a sensitive and specific plasmid-based typing assay to discriminate LGV from non-LGV CT subtypes. This is useful in a clinical setting to quickly determine the optimal treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis infections.","['Smit PW', 'Cornelissen AR', 'Bruisten SM']",2020,15,6,PLoS One,"Smit PW, et al.

31876865,Evaluation of 2 Commercial Assays for the Detection of Lymphogranuloma Venereum in Rectal Samples.,"BACKGROUND: The early identification of the Chlamydia trachomatis variants that cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is very important to establish an adequate antibiotic treatment. This identification should be made with molecular techniques that are easy to perform and accessible to most microbiology laboratories. The objective of this study was to evaluate 2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay (VIASURE Haemophilus ducreyi + C. trachomatis (LGV) real-time PCR detection kit and the Allplex Genital ulcer Assay) for the detection of LGV in rectal samples.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective study on positive rectal samples for C. trachomatis. All samples were processed in parallel by both tests. As a molecular reference method and to solve possible discrepancies between both assays, a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the major outer membrane protein gene (omp1) was used.
RESULTS: In total, we detected 157 positive rectal samples for C. trachomatis, of which 36 were identified as LGV by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and overall percent agreement were 88.9%, 100%, and 97.3%, respectively, for the Allplex Genital ulcer assay and 91.6%, 100%, and 97.1%, respectively, for the VIASURE assay. In the direct comparison between the Seegene assay and the VIASURE assay, we obtained a kappa concordance index of 0.98 between both tests.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the results obtained, both tests could be used for the detection of LGV in rectal samples.","['Bernal-Martínez S', 'García Sánchez E', 'Sivianes N', 'Padilla L', 'Martin-Mazuelos E']",2020,47,3,Sex Transm Dis,"Bernal-Martínez S, et al.

Epidemiological reports indicate diversity in the frequency of Chlamydia-associated ReA in various parts of the world, with evidence of declining incidence in some regions.
RECENT FINDINGS: The hypothesis that early effective treatment with antibiotics prevents the manifestation of Chlamydia-associated ReA requires further investigation. For clinicians, it is important to remember that ReA secondary to Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serovars L1-L3 of C. trachomatis is probably underestimated due to a limited awareness of this condition, the re-emergence in Western countries of LGV overall, and the present increasingly rare classical inguinal presentation.","['Zeidler H', 'Hudson AP']",2019,21,11,Curr Rheumatol Rep,Zeidler H and Hudson AP.

METHODS: LGV notification data between 2006 and 2015 from New South Wales were analysed to describe time trends in counts and rates by gender, age group and area of residence, as well as anatomical sites of infection. A positivity ratio was calculated using the number of LGV notifications per 100 anorectal chlamydia notifications per year. Data linkage was used to ascertain the proportion of LGV cases that were co-infected with HIV.
RESULTS: There were 208 notifications of LGV in NSW from 2006 to 2015; all were among men, with a median age of 42 years, and half were residents of inner-city Sydney. Annual notifications peaked at 57 (1.6 per 100,000 males) in 2010, declined to 16 (0.4 per 100,000 males) in 2014, and then increased to 34 (0.9 per 100,000 males) in 2015. Just under half (47.4%) of LGV cases were determined to be co-infected with HIV.

Lymphogranuloma venereum infections in heterosexuals are extremely rare in Europe, and there is no evidence of transmission of LGV in the European heterosexual population.
AETIOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION: Chlamydia trachomatis serovars/genovars L2b and L2 are the causative strains in the majority of cases in Europe.
CLINICAL FEATURES: Among MSM, about 25% of the anorectal LGV infections are asymptomatic. Genital infections among MSM are rare; the ratio of genital vs. anorectal LGV infections is 1 in 15.
DIAGNOSIS: To diagnose LGV, a sample tested C. trachomatis positive with a commercial nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) platform should be confirmed with an LGV discriminatory NAAT.
TREATMENT: Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day orally for 21 days is the recommended treatment for LGV. This same treatment is recommended also in asymptomatic patients and contacts of LGV patients. If another regimen is used, a test of cure (TOC) must be performed.","['de Vries HJC', 'de Barbeyrac B', 'de Vrieze NHN', 'Viset JD', 'White JA', 'Vall-Mayans M', 'Unemo M']",2019,33,10,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"de Vries HJC, et al. 2019 European guideline on the management of lymphogranuloma venereum. 2019 European guideline on the management of lymphogranuloma venereum. 2019; 33:1821-1828. doi: 10.1111/jdv.15729",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31243838/

We developed and piloted LGV surveillance in three European countries without existing systems and performed a preliminary investigation of LGV epidemiology, where little evidence currently exists.
METHODS: We recruited STI or dermatovenereology clinics and associated laboratories serving men who have sex with men (MSM) in Austria, Croatia and Slovenia, using the UK for comparison. We undertook centralised LGV testing of 
RESULTS: In total, 500 specimens from CT-positive MSM were tested, and LGV positivity was 25.6% (128/500; 95% CI 22.0% to 29.6%) overall, and 47.6% (79/166; 40.1% to 55.2%) in Austria, 20.0% (3/15; 7.1% to 45.2%) in Croatia, 16.7% (1/6; 3.0% to 56.4%) in Slovenia and 14.4% (45/313; 10.9% to 18.7 %) in the UK.

30920748,Bacterial sexually transmitted infections.,"Worldwide, the incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has shown a significant increase in recent years. In Germany, this circumstance is reflected by a rise in the number of reported syphilis cases. There has also been an uptick in the incidence of non-notifiable STIs such as gonorrhea and infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium. A key factor in the spread of these infections is their varied clinical presentation, which includes urogenital, pharyngeal and rectal involvement as well as a large number of asymptomatic cases. New real-time multiplex PCR methods allow for rapid and targeted detection of STI pathogens. The most common bacterial STI is urogenital chlamydial infection caused by serovars D-K, which affects young adults in particular. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) caused by L serovars often presents as chlamydial proctitis. In recent years, Neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae has shown a significant development of resistance, with high-level monoresistance and multiresistance to antibiotics commonly used for treatment. It is therefore imperative that sensitivity testing of N. gonorrhoeae be performed in addition to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Increased drug resistance has also been observed for Mycoplasma genitalium, a fact that complicates treatment.","['Buder S', 'Schöfer H', 'Meyer T', 'Bremer V', 'Kohl PK', 'Skaletz-Rorowski A', 'Brockmeyer N']",2019,17,3,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Buder S, et al.

30722812,Bacterial sexually transmitted infections in France: recent trends and patients' characteristics in 2016.,"Diagnoses of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI) have been increasing in France since their resurgence in the late 1990s. This article presents recent epidemiological trends until 2016 and the patients' characteristics. STI surveillance relies on sentinel networks: a clinician-based network RésIST (clinical, biological and behavioural data for early syphilis and gonorrhoea), the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) network (clinical, biological and behavioural data for rectal LGV, and the laboratory networks Rénachla and Rénago (demographic and biological data for chlamydial infections and gonorrhoea, respectively). Here we describe trends between 2014 and 2016, using data from diagnostic centres which participated regularly during the study period. The number of early syphilis, gonorrhoea and LGV diagnoses increased between 2014 and 2016, particularly in men who have sex with men. An increase in syphilis and gonorrhoea cases was also observed in heterosexuals. Nevertheless, we observed a drop in 2016 for syphilis and chlamydial infections after two decades of increases. Under-reporting and shortage of benzathine penicillin in 2016 may explain this latest evolution. Regular screening of patients and partners, followed by prompt treatment, remains essential to interrupt STI transmission in a context where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention has expanded towards biomedical prophylaxis.","['Ndeikoundam Ngangro N', 'Viriot D', 'Fournet N', 'Pioche C', 'De Barbeyrac B', 'Goubard A', 'Dupin N', 'Berçot B', 'Fouéré S', 'Alcaraz I', 'Ohayon M', 'Spenatto N', 'Vernay-Vaisse C', 'referents for the regional offices of the French national public health agency', 'Pillonel J', 'Lot F']",2019,24,5,Euro Surveill,"Ndeikoundam Ngangro N, et al.

30572839,Lymphogranuloma venereum is on the rise in Belgium among HIV negative men who have sex with men: surveillance data from 2011 until the end of June 2017.,"BACKGROUND: The number of cases of Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is increasing in Europe. The described epidemic is mostly confined to HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM). However, dissemination of LGV from HIV positive to HIV negative MSM could take place due to the implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and subsequent possible decrease in condom use. We describe here the LGV epidemiology in Belgium before the PrEP-era, starting from 2011 up to the end of the first half of 2017.
METHODS: A descriptive analysis of the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of all LGV cases was performed. Fisher's exact test was used to compare symptomatic to asymptomatic patients. Logistic regression models were used to check for trends over time for: number of LGV cases, HIV status and symptoms.
RESULTS: The number of LGV cases rose by a factor four, from 21 in 2011 to 88 in 2016, and regression models showed a positive trend estimate of 14% increase per half year (p < 0.001). LGV decreased among HIV positive cases (odds ratio (OR): 0.79, p < 0.001) and increased among HIV negative cases (OR: 1.27, p < 0.001). In addition, a rise in the number of asymptomatic LGV cases (6.7%) was observed (OR:1.39, p = 0.047). Asymptomatic cases were also less likely to be HIV (p = 0.046) or Hepatitis C positive (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: The rise of LGV in HIV negative MSM has now been documented. If we aim to halt the epidemic in HIV negative MSM, future public health strategies should include LGV testing of all Chlamydia trachomatis positive samples from MSM.","['De Baetselier I', 'Tsoumanis A', 'Verbrugge R', 'De Deken B', 'Smet H', 'Abdellati S', 'Cuylaerts V', 'Apers L', 'Crucitti T']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"De Baetselier I, et al.

30507675,"Lymphoganuloma venereum in the Western world, 15 years after its re-emergence: new perspectives and research priorities.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a serious sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. If left untreated LGV can cause irreversible late sequelae. LGV is endemic among a high-risk population of men who have sex with men (MSM), and largely reported in Western metropoles.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although the majority of LGV patients are HIV positive, in recent years the proportion of HIV-negative MSM with LGV is rising. This could indicate a shift toward lower risk populations. Apart from a few European countries, no proper LGV surveillance efforts have been implemented so far. Moreover, a considerable proportion of the infections are asymptomatic. As a result, the true magnitude of the LGV epidemic is underestimated.Depending on the stage and location of infection, LGV manifests in a variety of clinical presentations. Among MSM, anorectal infections are overreported as opposed to genital LGV infections in a ratio of 15 to 1, respectively. Therefore, other modes of transmission apart from anal sex are here discussed.
SUMMARY: To improve surveillance, cheaper and more practical screening methods are needed. Moreover, randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate more simple treatment modalities as opposed to the currently recommended 3-week course of doxycycline.",['de Vries HJC'],2019,32,1,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"de Vries HJC.

They occur mainly in tropical countries, i. e. regions situated between the equator and the northern and southern 23.5° latitudes, regions which are characterized by hot humid climates as well as poverty and underdevelopment. These three diseases are primarily associated with ulcerations of the skin, thus their presence represents an increased risk for transmission of HIV and other STI.

30125691,Delayed diagnosis of colorectal sexually transmitted diseases due to their resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases.,"OBJECTIVE: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), mainly lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), induce colorectal symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study describes patients who presented with STDs masquerading as IBD in order to improve understanding of missed diagnosis of colorectal STDs and their association with LGV in Israel.
METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study characterized the clinical, endoscopic, and pathological findings of 16 patients who were diagnosed with a colorectal STD after erroneously being diagnosed with IBD. Molecular genotyping was used to characterize some of the Chlamydia trachomatis isolates.
RESULTS: All patients were men who have sex with men (MSM), mostly HIV-1-positive, and had clinical and endoscopic findings compatible with IBD. The STD was diagnosed 1-36 months after the initial diagnosis: 14 were positive for Chlamydia trachomatis, of which three were of the LGV2b (ST58) serotype and one was ST 108 serotype. Five were positive for gonorrhea and four were positive for syphilis. Several pathogens were diagnosed in six episodes.
CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal STDs may resemble IBD and therefore their diagnosis may be delayed. IBD symptoms in MSM who engage in non-protected anal sex should prompt at least syphilis and anal PCR for STD testing. If C. trachomatis is diagnosed but LGV subtyping cannot be done, doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 21days should be recommended.","['Levy I', 'Gefen-Halevi S', 'Nissan I', 'Keller N', 'Pilo S', 'Wieder-Finesod A', 'Litchevski V', 'Shasha D', 'Kedem E', 'Rahav G']",2018,75,,Int J Infect Dis,"Levy I, et al.

This localization differs from the classical inguinal abscesses which are typical of the disease in the tropics. The objective of this work is to document the presence of anorectal lymphogranuloma venereum in Buenos Aires and to describe its varied clinical manifestations. In the context of a systematic survey of rectal chlamydial infection, in just one trimester, eight cases of lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis biovar LGV were identified in HIV-infected men who have sex with men. The most frequent anorectal manifestations were pus, tenesmus, rectal urgency, and mucous or haemopurulent discharge. The proctitis was mostly mild or moderate and, in some cases, it was accompanied by perianal lesions. Given the great polymorphism and unspecificity of the clinical manifestations of the disease, we warn on the presence of this form of rectal lymphogranuloma venereum in our setting. If Chlamydia trachomatis is detected, it should be genotyped, not only for the correct diagnosis and treatment but also for epidemiological surveillance.

METHODOLOGY: From January to November 2017, 165 MSM attending a STI outpatients clinic in Bologna (Italy) and reporting unsafe anal intercourses were enrolled. An ano-rectal swab was collected from each patient: chlamydial and gonococcal infections were diagnosed by a commercial NAAT, whereas an in-house quantitative PCR was used for M. genitalium detection. In addition, 131 urine samples and 84 pharyngeal swabs underwent testing for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. A molecular C. trachomatis typing, a serological screening for anti-Chlamydia IgG and IgA, as well as the assessment of HIV, HCV and syphilis infections, were performed.Results/Key findings. The prevalence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium rectal infections was 27.2, 25.4 and 4.8 %, respectively. Globally, 63.1 % of cases were asymptomatic and up to 80 % of chlamydial and gonococcal infections would have been missed if the rectal site had not been tested. All the patients with rectal M. genitalium carriage were asymptomatic and characterized by low bacterial loads (<2500 DNA copies/reaction). Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) prevalence was 12.1 % with a considerable proportion of asymptomatic infections (35 %). The presence of symptoms, age >30, HIV-positivity and elevated levels of anti-Chlamydia antibodies were the most significant predictors of LGV.

29667379,Lymphogranuloma venereum genovar L2b concomitantly with syphilis and hepatitis C in a male patient in Poland – case report.,"We describe the first case of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in Poland, with inguino-femoral lymphadenopathy, diagnosed and successfully treated according to the 2013 European LGV guideline. Chlamydia trachomatis genovar L2b, mainly responsible for the ongoing LGV epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Western European countries, was confirmed. The case also verified that co-infections with other sexually transmitted infections (syphilis and hepatitis C virus) are frequent in MSM LGV patients, as well as the very large difficulties with contact tracing for these patients. LGV needs to be considered in the diagnosis of inguinal lymph nodes inflammation or proctitis, especially in MSM. It is also crucial to have access to appropriate laboratory diagnostic methods in order to screen for and confirm all LGV cases by typing C. trachomatis genovars.","['Serwin AB', 'Koper M', 'Unemo M']",2018,72,1,Przegl Epidemiol,"Serwin AB, et al.

Demographic and biomedical characteristics of all patients with chlamydia-positive sample results were retrieved for the years 2013 and 2014. Samples were obtained from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who consulted at the HIV/STI clinic. Fifty four patients with laboratory confirmed LGV were detected among 3885 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) performed for the detection of chlamydia during the two years under review. Fifty three were men and equally fifty three had sex with men only (MSM). HIV (87%) and HCV (31.5%) were common concomitant infections, whilst anal gonorrhoea and syphilis were detected at the moment of the LGV diagnosis among 19 (35.2%) and 6 (11.0%) cases respectively. All cases were symptomatic, except one. The most frequent symptoms that were recorded could be categorised as proctitis (in 40 patients (74%)). Lymphadenopathy, anal and genital ulcers were signs that were present in 7 (13.0%), 4 (7.4%) and 2 patients (3.7%) respectively. LGV remains an important sexually transmitted disease among MSM. In this retrospective study, the far majority of LGV was detected amongst symptomatic persons. HCV, HIV, anal gonorrhoea and syphilis were associated co-infections. Proctitis in a high risk patient should alert the clinician for the possibility of an STI.","['Apers L', 'Florence E', 'Crucitti T', 'Anwar N']",2017,80,3,Acta Gastroenterol Belg,"Apers L, et al.

29465660,Observed Treatment Responses to Short-Course Doxycycline Therapy for Rectal Lymphogranuloma Venereum in Men Who Have Sex With Men.,"BACKGROUND: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) has reestablished itself as an endemic sexually transmitted infection in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe and North America over the last decade. Current guidelines suggest treatment with 21 days of doxycycline; however, the evidence base for LGV treatment including its duration is very limited.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review in 2 central London genitourinary medicine clinics of men who have sex with men (MSM) with LGV in whom less than 21 days of doxycycline was used initially.
RESULTS: Sixty MSM were treated initially with less than 21 days of doxycycline, of whom 50 (83%) were prescribed a 7-day course. Fifty percent of patients were asymptomatic, with the rest having rectal or other symptoms. Fifty-nine (97%) of 60 had a negative test of cure for LGV at a median of 31 days (7-200 days). Reinfection as opposed to treatment failure was considered likely in the patient testing positive. A second test of cure at a median of 139 days later (37-638 days) was completed in 30 patients, of whom 28 (93%) were negative for LGV.
CONCLUSIONS: Seven to 14 days of doxycycline is effective in most cases of LGV with negative TOCs in 59 of 60 patients. These data suggest that 7 days of doxycycline is effective in achieving cure of rectal LGV in most MSM. There is a case for a randomized controlled trial of LGV treatment including a 7-day regimen of doxycycline.","['Simons R', 'Candfield S', 'French P', 'White JA']",2018,45,6,Sex Transm Dis,"Simons R, et al.

METHODS: MSM were recruited for this observational cohort in Lagos, Nigeria, using respondent-driven sampling and screened for HIV and bacterial STIs every three months for up to 18 months. Nucleic acid amplification tests for CT were performed on rectal swab specimens. Prevalent and incident cases of anorectal CT underwent additional testing to identify LGV using novel real-time PCR assays specific for the L-serovars of CT.
RESULTS: From April 2014 to July 2016, 420 MSM underwent testing for rectal STIs, of whom 66 (15.7%) had prevalent anorectal CT. Among those without prevalent disease, 68 developed incident infections during 208 person-years of follow-up. Of 134 prevalent and incident cases of anorectal CT, 7 (5.2%) were identified as LGV. None of the seven participants with LGV reported any symptoms. Two of the participants with LGV were simultaneously coinfected with rectal gonorrhoea. HIV coinfection was common among participants with both LGV (n=5, 71%) and non-LGV (n=98, 77%) serovars of CT (P=0.66).
CONCLUSIONS: Anorectal LGV was uncommon but present among Nigerian MSM in this study.

LGV infection occurs most often at anal sites causing proctitis. Urethral and oropharyngeal infections are rare. In Quebec, LGV incidence has been increasing exponentially in recent years and the current guidelines support systematic LGV genotype testing among anorectal CT-positive samples only.

29240636,The Etiology of Genital Ulcer Disease and Coinfections With Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Zimbabwe: Results From the Zimbabwe STI Etiology Study.,"BACKGROUND: In many countries, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are treated syndromically. Thus, patients diagnosed as having genital ulcer disease (GUD) in Zimbabwe receive a combination of antimicrobials to treat syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and genital herpes. Periodic studies are necessary to assess the current etiology of GUD and assure the appropriateness of current treatment guidelines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 6 geographically diverse clinics in Zimbabwe serving high numbers of STI cases to enroll men and women with STI syndromes, including GUD. Sexually transmitted infection history and risk behavioral data were collected by questionnaire and uploaded to a Web-based database. Ulcer specimens were obtained for testing using a validated multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) assay for Treponema pallidum (TP; primary syphilis), Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid), LGV-associated strains of Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2. Blood samples were collected for testing with HIV, treponemal, and nontreponemal serologic assays.
RESULTS: Among 200 GUD patients, 77 (38.5%) were positive for HSV, 32 (16%) were positive for TP, and 2 (1%) were positive for LGV-associated strains of C trachomatis. No H ducreyi infections were detected. No organism was found in 98 (49.5%) of participants. The overall HIV positivity rate was 52.2% for all GUD patients, with higher rates among women compared with men (59.8% vs 45.2%, P < 0.05) and among patients with HSV (68.6% vs 41.8%, P < 0.0001). Among patients with GUD, 54 (27.3%) had gonorrhea and/or chlamydia infection. However, in this latter group, 66.7% of women and 70.0% of men did not have abnormal vaginal or urethral discharge on examination.
CONCLUSIONS: Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of GUD in our survey, followed by T. pallidum. No cases of chancroid were detected. The association of HIV infections with HSV suggests high risk for cotransmission; however, some HSV ulcerations may be due to HSV reactivation among immunocompromised patients. The overall prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia was high among patients with GUD and most of them did not meet the criteria for concomitant syndromic management covering these infections.","['Mungati M', 'Machiha A', 'Mugurungi O', 'Tshimanga M', 'Kilmarx PH', 'Nyakura J', 'Shambira G', 'Kupara V', 'Lewis DA', 'Gonese E', 'Tippett Barr BA', 'Handsfield HH', 'Rietmeijer CA']",2018,45,1,Sex Transm Dis,"Mungati M, et al.

LGV increased from sporadic import cases in 2004 to comprise a spread within Sweden in 2016. Initially, only the L2b ompA genotype was detected, but in 2015 half of the genotyped LGV cases were L2 genotype. The changing genotype distribution in Sweden is linked to increased LGV spread in Europe. High-resolution multilocus sequence typing of 168 C. trachomatis cases from MSM in 2015 resulted in 29 sequence types, of which 3 accounted for 49 % of cases. The increased rates and different genotypes of LGV indicate that more concern for high-risk taking MSM is needed to avoid further spread of this invasive infection.","['Isaksson J', 'Carlsson O', 'Airell Å', 'Strömdahl S', 'Bratt G', 'Herrmann B']",2017,66,11,J Med Microbiol,"Isaksson J, et al.

METHODS: Rhesus macaques inoculated with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) (serovars LGV-L2 and CT-E; n = 7) or saline (n = 7) received up to 20 rectal challenges twice a week of simian/HIV immunodeficiency virus (SHIVSF162p3). SHIV viremia was determined by real-time PCR and Chlamydia infection by APTIMA Combo 2 testing. The rectal cytokine-chemokine levels were evaluated by multiplex bead assays.
RESULTS: Rectal Chlamydia infection was maintained throughout the study. We did not observe significant differences (P = 1.0) in frequency of SHIV acquisition between the STI and control arms. It took fewer SHIV challenges to infect the STI animals although the difference was not significant (P = 0.59). There were no significant differences in peak plasma viremia between STI and control arms (P = 0.63). The association of plasma viremia with rectal shedding was significantly different by arm (P = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: In the first such study in a macaque model, we did not observe an increased risk of SHIV acquisition due to rectal Chlamydia coinfection. This macaque model can be further developed and expanded to better investigate the impact of different rectal STIs on HIV acquisition.","['Vishwanathan SA', 'Aubert RD', 'Morris MR', 'Zhao C', 'Philips C', 'Khalil GM', 'Deyounks F', 'Kelley K', 'Ritter JM', 'Chen CY', 'Kersh EN', 'McNicholl JM']",2017,44,9,Sex Transm Dis,"Vishwanathan SA, et al.

28577539,"Inguinal and anorectal Lymphogranuloma Venereum: a case series from a sexually transmitted disease center in Rome, Italy.","BACKGROUND: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by L1, L2, L3 serovars of C. trachomatis (CT). Since 2003, LGV cases have been increasing in Europe. Aim of this report is to describe the LGV cases diagnosed in the largest STI center in Rome, Italy, from 2000 to 2016. This report shows that two clinically and epidemiologically different series of cases exist, and that, at present, the ano-rectal LGV represents the clinical variant occurring more frequently among men having sex with men (MSM), particularly those HIV-infected.
CASE PRESENTATION: Ten cases of LGV were observed. Three were diagnosed in 2009 in HIV-negative heterosexuals patients that presented the classical genito-ulcerative form with lymphadenopathy. Seven cases were observed in 2015-2016 in HIV-infected MSM, that presented the rectal variant and L2b serovar infection; 4 of these had been misclassified as a chronic bowel disease. Chlamydia infection was confirmed by CT-specific PCR (ompA gene nested PCR), followed by sequence analysis to identify the serovar. All the patients were treated with doxycycline for 3 weeks, obtaining a complete response with healing of both clinical symptoms and dermatological lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, in case of persistent rectal symptoms in HIV-infected MSM, LGV should be taken into account and investigated through molecular analyses, in order to achieve a correct diagnosis and management of the patients.","['Latini A', 'Zaccarelli M', 'Paglia MG', 'Donà MG', 'Giglio A', 'Moretto D', 'Vulcano A', 'Giuliani M', 'Colafigli M', 'Ambrifi M', 'Pimpinelli F', 'Cristaudo A']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Latini A, et al.

28562672,Rapid detection and strain typing of Chlamydia trachomatis using a highly multiplexed microfluidic PCR assay.,"Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are recommended by the CDC for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) urogenital infections. Current commercial NAATs require technical expertise and sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, are time-consuming and expensive, and do not differentiate the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) strains that require a longer duration of treatment than non-LGV strains. The multiplexed microfluidic PCR-based assay presented in this work simultaneously interrogates 13 loci to detect Ct and identify LGV and non-LGV strain-types. Based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms, the assay differentiates LGV, ocular, urogenital, and proctocolitis clades, and also serovars L1, L2, and L3 within the LGV group. The assay was evaluated in a blinded fashion using 95 clinical swabs, with 76 previously reported as urogenital Ct-positive samples and typed by ompA genotyping and/or Multi-Locus Sequence Typing. Results of the 13-plex assay showed that 51 samples fell within urogenital clade 2 or 4, 24 samples showed both clade 2 and 4 signatures, indicating possible mixed infection, gene rearrangement, or inter-clade recombination, and one sample was a noninvasive trachoma biovar (either a clade 3 or 4). The remaining 19 blinded samples were correctly identified as LGV clade 1 (3), ocular clade 3 (4), or as negatives (12). To date, no NAAT assay can provide a point-of-care applicable turnaround time for Ct detection while identifying clinically significant Ct strain types to inform appropriate treatment. Coupled with rapid DNA processing of clinical swabs (approximately 60 minutes from swab-in to result-out), the assay has significant potential as a rapid POC diagnostic for Ct infections.","['Turingan RS', 'Kaplun L', 'Krautz-Peterson G', 'Norsworthy S', 'Zolotova A', 'Joseph SJ', 'Read TD', 'Dean D', 'Tan E', 'Selden RF']",2017,12,5,PLoS One,"Turingan RS, et al.

27681919,Diagnostic Procedures to Detect Chlamydia trachomatis Infections.,"The intracellular life style of chlamydia and the ability to cause persistent infections with low-grade replication requires tests with high analytical sensitivity to directly detect C. trachomatis (CT) in medical samples. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the most sensitive assays with a specificity similar to cell culture and are considered the method of choice for CT detection. In addition, NAATs can be performed on various clinical specimens that do not depend on specific transport and storage conditions, since NAATs do not require infectious bacteria. In the case of lower genital tract infections, first void urine and vaginal swabs are the recommended specimens for testing males and females, respectively. Infections of anorectal, oropharyngeal and ocular epithelia should also be tested by NAAT analysis of corresponding mucosal swabs. In particular, anorectal infections of men who have sex with men (MSM) should include evaluation of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) by identification of genotypes L1, L2 or L3. Detection of CT antigens by enzyme immunoassay (EIAs) or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are unsuitable due to insufficient sensitivity and specificity. Recent PCR-based RDTs, however, are non-inferior to standard NAATs, and might be used at the point-of-care. Serology finds application in the diagnostic work-up of suspected chronic CT infection but is inappropriate to diagnose acute infections.",['Meyer T'],2016,4,3,Microorganisms,Meyer T.

LGV is characterized by inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy, typically following a transient, self-limited genital ulcer or papule that might go unnoticed. Rectal infection can result in proctocolitis that can present with mucoid and/or hemorrhagic rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, and tenesmus, and signs of granulomas and/or ulcerations on anoscopy (1,2). LGV can be an invasive, systemic infection, and if it is not treated early, LGV proctocolitis can lead to chronic colorectal fistulas and strictures (2). In Europe, outbreaks of LGV have been reported among men who have sex with men (MSM), often in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection (3-5). The prevalence of LGV in the United States is unknown (1), because diagnostic tests to differentiate LGV from non-LGV Chlamydia trachomatis are not widely available (6), and providers might not know that they should report cases that are presumptively treated.","['de Voux A', 'Kent JB', 'Macomber K', 'Krzanowski K', 'Jackson D', 'Starr T', 'Johnson S', 'Richmond D', 'Crane LR', 'Cohn J', 'Finch C', 'McFadden J', 'Pillay A', 'Chen C', 'Anderson L', 'Kersh EN']",2016,65,34,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"de Voux A, et al.

27412206,Approach to lymphogranuloma venereum.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the literature about lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and to provide an overview and discussion of practice guidelines.
SOURCES OF INFORMATION: The terms Chlamydia trachomatis and lymphogranuloma venereum were searched separately in PubMed. Empirical studies, practice reviews, and clinical guidelines were included. All reference lists were reviewed for additional articles.
MAIN MESSAGE: Since 2003, there has been a resurgence of LGV among men who have sex with men in many Western countries, including Canada. Although LGV is a serovar of Chlamydia trachomatis (serovar L), it can invade regional lymph nodes, and consequently presents with different symptoms than the other subtypes of chlamydia (serovars A through K). Specifically, LGV transitions through 3 phases: a painless papule or ulcer at the site of inoculation; invasion of the regional lymph nodes, which can present with an inguinal or rectal syndrome; and irreversible destruction of lymph tissue. In contrast, chlamydia serovars A to K exclusively produce superficial mucosal infections. Lymphogranuloma venereum also requires a different treatment regimen than other chlamydia serovars.
CONCLUSION: In light of the current resurgence of LGV, its unique symptoms and clinical course, and its requirement for a different treatment than other chlamydia serovars, it is important for primary care providers to recognize when LGV should be included as an appropriate differential diagnosis.","[""O'Byrne P"", 'MacPherson P', 'DeLaplante S', 'Metz G', 'Bourgault A']",2016,62,7,Can Fam Physician,"O'Byrne P, et al.

The first three reports of possible LGV in Slovenia were from April to June 2015, followed by a confirmed case of LGV in August 2015. We present the case of an HIV-positive MSM that presented with an anorectal abscess, discharge, lymphadenopathy, and unusual perianal plaque. Gonococcal proctitis was assumed and he received empirical antibiotic treatment, after which only intermittent improvement occurred. After a positive test result for chlamydial infection, but without a response to azithromycin treatment, LGV was suspected. Treatment according to the guidelines was introduced. When doxycycline therapy started, rapid improvement was observed, and it was therefore assumed that the LGV infection had been successfully treated. Two similar cases with an unusual anorectal presentation and an excellent response to antibiotic therapy for LGV were observed at the same center shortly thereafter. While pointing out possible delays and limitations in diagnostic procedures at self-pay facilities, the need for better access to high quality STI management in public and in private services is emphasized. Enhanced surveillance and testing guidelines could reveal a hidden LGV epidemic among MSM in Slovenia.","['Mlakar B', 'Ramšak A']",2016,25,2,Acta Dermatovenerol Alp Pannonica Adriat,Mlakar B and Ramšak A.

27322040,Anorectal Lymphogranuloma Venereum in Madrid: A Persistent Emerging Problem in Men Who Have Sex With Men.,"BACKGROUND: Since 2003, outbreaks of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) with anorectal syndrome have been increasingly recognized in many Western countries. All of them have been classified as LGV serovar L2b, mainly occurring in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men who have had sex with men (MSM). We describe a series of 26 diagnosed cases of LGV proctitis in downtown Madrid, Spain, in 2014, after implementing routine diagnostic procedures for this disease in symptomatic MSM.
METHODS: We conducted an observational study of patients with symptomatic proctitis attending an outpatient infectious diseases clinic in Madrid, Spain during calendar year 2014. Clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and therapeutic data were gathered and analyzed.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis. All were MSM, and 24 of them were HIV-positive. All patients reported having acute proctitis symptoms including tenesmus (85%), pain (88%), constipation (62%), or anal discharge (96%). Proctoscopy showed mucopurulent exudate (25 patients [96%]), and rectal bleeding, with mucosal erythema and/or oedema in all cases. Rectal swabs were obtained from all patients, and LGV serovar L2 was confirmed in all of them. The cure rate was 100% after standard treatments with doxycycline 100 mg twice per day for 3 weeks. Simultaneous rectal infections with other sexually transmitted pathogens (gonorrhoea, herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma genitalium) and systemic sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (syphilis, acute HIV, and hepatitis C infections) were also documented in 12 patients (46%), but these co-infections did not appear to influence the clinical manifestations of LGV.
CONCLUSIONS: Anorectal LGV is a common cause of acute proctitis and proctocolitis among HIV-infected MSM who practice unprotected anal sex, and it is frequently associated with other rectal STDs. The implementation of routine screening and prompt diagnosis of these rectal infections should be mandatory in all clinical settings attended by HIV and STD patients.","['Cabello Úbeda A', 'Fernández Roblas R', 'García Delgado R', 'Martínez García L', 'Sterlin F', 'Fernández Guerrero ML', 'Górgolas M']",2016,43,7,Sex Transm Dis,"Cabello Úbeda A, et al.

Our aim was to evaluate LGV prevalence and predictors in a high-risk population attending to two STI clinics in the southwest of Spain between December 2013 and April 2015.
METHODS: Screening of C. trachomatis using commercial kits was carried out, followed by real-time pmpH-PCR discriminating LGV strains, and finally ompA gene was sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction.
RESULTS: A total of 6398 samples were tested, of which, 594 (9.3%) were C. trachomatis-positive specimens and successfully typed by pmpH PCR. Five hundred and eighty-one samples contained non-LGV and 13 (2.2%; 95% CI 1.3% to 3.7%) samples had LGV. One hundred and sixty-six (27.9%; 95% CI 24.5% to 31.7%) CT-positive results were found in MSM. All C. trachomatis LGV types were found in rectal samples from MSM (13/166, 7.8%; 95% CI 4.5% to 13.0%). Of these, five (38.5%; 95% CI 17.7% to 64.5%) patients were asymptomatic and 11 (84.6%; 95% CI 57.8% to 95.7%; p<0.001) were also HIV positive. Successful treatment of LGV was achieved in all patients including 11/13 (84.6%) who received single-dose azithromycin. All of the L types were confirmed to be genotype L2b with ompA PCR and sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that LGV infections are occurring in MSM in southwest Spain, where no data about LGV have been described before, reinforcing the need for screening and genotyping for LGV. LGV should be taken into account when considering treatment and management of rectal C. trachomatis infections, including in asymptomatic HIV-positive MSM.

27198633,Enhanced surveillance of a lymphogranuloma venereum outbreak in Sydney 2010-2012.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate an increase in lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) notifications in New South Wales (NSW).
METHODS: Enhanced surveillance of notified LGV cases in NSW between May 2010 and April 2012 using doctor and patient questionnaires.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven doctors who had diagnosed 67 (76%) of 88 notified anorectal LGV infections were interviewed. The majority (n=33, 89%) of treating doctors were formally trained and accredited in HIV management and prescribing, and most (n=32, 86%) worked in a public sexual health clinic or a general practice with a high caseload of men who have sex with men (MSM). All 67 cases were MSM who resided in inner-city Sydney and all were serovar L2b. Anal symptoms had been present in 64 cases (96%, 95%CI 87-99%) for a median of 8 days (range 2-1,825) prior to presentation. Almost one-third (n=20) had another concurrent STI diagnosed. Most (82%) of the 22 interviewed patients reported being HIV positive and having other STIs diagnosed over the past year. In the preceding month, all 22 men reported condomless anal sex and the median number of casual sexual partners was 5 (range 0-100).
CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of LGV cases in NSW are similar to those described worldwide, suggesting that a sexually adventurous subgroup of MSM are at particular risk of infection.
IMPLICATIONS: Education of non-sexual-health clinicians on LGV risk factors, presentation, testing and management may allow more timely diagnosis and notification of contacts to reduce LGV transmission in the community.","['Templeton DJ', 'Ressler KA', 'Hope K', 'Poynten IM']",2016,40,4,Aust N Z J Public Health,"Templeton DJ, et al.

METHODS: Population-based incidence study of all newly occurring diagnoses of HIV infection, syphilis, gonorrhea and LGV detected in Barcelona between January 2007 and December 2011. A descriptive analysis was performed. The annual incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated by sex, sexual conduct and educational level. To estimate global sex-specific rates we used the Barcelona city census; for the calculation of rates by sexual conduct and educational level we used estimates of the Barcelona Health Interview Survey. Trends were analysed using the chi-squared test for linear trend.
RESULTS: HIV. 66.8 % of the HIV cases were men who had sex with men (MSM). The incidence rates in MSM over the study period were from 692.67/100,000 to 909.88/100,000 inh. Syphilis. 74.2 % of the syphilis cases were MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 224.9/100,000 to 891.97/100,000 inh. and the MSM with a university education ranged from 196.3/100,000 to 1020.8/100,000. Gonorrhea. 45.5 % of the gonorrhea cases were MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 164.24/100,000 to 404.79/100,000 inh. and the MSM with university education ranged from 176.7/100,000 to 530.1/100,000 inh.. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). 95.3 % of the LGV cases are MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 24.99/100,000 to 282.99/100,000 inh. and the MSM with university education ranged from 9.3/100,000 to 265/100,000 inh.
CONCLUSION: An increase in cases of STI was observed. These STI mainly affected MSM with a university education. Continuing to monitor changes in the epidemiology of STI, and identifying the most affected groups should permit redesigning preventive programs, with the goal of finding the most efficient way to reach these population groups.","['Martí-Pastor M', 'García de Olalla P', 'Barberá MJ', 'Manzardo C', 'Ocaña I', 'Knobel H', 'Gurguí M', 'Humet V', 'Vall M', 'Ribera E', 'Villar J', 'Martín G', 'Sambeat MA', 'Marco A', 'Vives A', 'Alsina M', 'Miró JM', 'Caylà JA', 'HIV Surveillance Group']",2015,15,,BMC Public Health,"Martí-Pastor M, et al.

26423146,Genome expansion in bacteria: the curios case of Chlamydia trachomatis.,"BACKGROUND: Recent findings indicated that a correlation between genomic % AT and genome size within strains of microbial species was predominantly associated with the uptake of foreign DNA. One species however, Chlamydia trachomatis, defied any explanation. In the present study 79 fully sequenced C. trachomatis genomes, representing ocular- (nine strains), urogenital- (36 strains) and lymphogranuloma venereum strains (LGV, 22 strains), in three pathogroups, in addition to 12 laboratory isolates, were scrutinized with the intent of elucidating the positive correlation between genomic AT content and genome size.
RESULTS: The average size difference between the strains of each pathogroup was largely explained by the incorporation of genetic fragments. These fragments were slightly more AT rich than their corresponding host genomes, but not enough to justify the difference in AT content between the strains of the smaller genomes lacking the fragments. In addition, a genetic region predominantly found in the ocular strains, which had the largest genomes, was on average more GC rich than the host genomes of the urogenital strains (58.64% AT vs. 58.69% AT), which had the second largest genomes, implying that the foreign genetic regions cannot alone explain the association between genome size and AT content in C. trachomatis. 23,492 SNPs were identified for all 79 genomes, and although the SNPs were on average slightly GC rich (~47% AT), a significant association was found between genome-wide SNP AT content, for each pathogroup, and genome size (p < 0.001, R (2) = 0.86) in the C. trachomatis strains.
CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between genome size and AT content, with respect to the C. trachomatis pathogroups, was explained by the incorporation of genetic fragments unique to the ocular and/or urogenital strains into the LGV- and urogential strains in addition to the genome-wide SNP AT content differences between the three pathogroups.",['Bohlin J'],2015,8,,BMC Res Notes,Bohlin J.

26301124,Challenges Presented by Re-Emerging Sexually Transmitted Infections in HIV Positive Men who have Sex with Men: An Observational Study of Lymphogranuloma Venereum in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: United Kingdom has reported the largest documented outbreak of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a re-emerging sexually transmitted infection (STI) which is primarily seen in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). A diagnostic service was established in response to the outbreak linked to a voluntary LGV Enhanced Surveillance system. We examined the performance of this novel surveillance system to identify utility in tracking a re-emerging infection.
METHODS: We described laboratory data on samples and surveillance data from case reports for LGV from 2004-2010. We performed a cross-sectional analysis comparing clinical and behavioural characteristics of HIV-positive and HIV-negative/unknown LGV cases diagnosed in MSM using multivariable logistic regression models with generalised estimating equations to control for repeat infections.
RESULTS: LGV Surveillance data were available for 87% (1,370/1,581) of LGV cases (after de-duplication). There were 1,342 episodes in 1,281 MSM, most of whom were known to be HIV-positive (1,028/1,281, 80.2%,). HIV-positive men reported a shorter duration of symptoms (aOR 0.5; 95%CI 0.3, 0.8 for reporting more than a week compared to a week or less) in comparison to HIV-negative/unknown MSM, and were more likely to report unprotected receptive anal intercourse (aOR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3, 5.8).
CONCLUSION: The surveillance identified the population at greater risk of infection based on higher levels of risk behaviour in HIV-positive LGV cases. However, there was diagnostic bias towards HIV-positive LGV cases who presented with a shorter duration of symptoms when compared to HIV-negative/unknown LGV cases.","['Rönn M', 'Hughes G', 'Simms I', 'Ison C', 'Alexander S', 'White PJ', 'Ward H']",2014,5,8,J AIDS Clin Res,"Rönn M, et al.

26207372,Chlamydia trachomatis In Vivo to In Vitro Transition Reveals Mechanisms of Phase Variation and Down-Regulation of Virulence Factors.,"Research on the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis demands culture in cell-lines, but the adaptive process behind the in vivo to in vitro transition is not understood. We assessed the genomic and transcriptomic dynamics underlying C. trachomatis in vitro adaptation of strains representing the three disease groups (ocular, epithelial-genital and lymphogranuloma venereum) propagated in epithelial cells over multiple passages. We found genetic features potentially underlying phase variation mechanisms mediating the regulation of a lipid A biosynthesis enzyme (CT533/LpxC), and the functionality of the cytotoxin (CT166) through an ON/OFF mechanism. We detected inactivating mutations in CT713/porB, a scenario suggesting metabolic adaptation to the available carbon source. CT135 was inactivated in a tropism-specific manner, with CT135-negative clones emerging for all epithelial-genital populations (but not for LGV and ocular populations) and rapidly increasing in frequency (~23% mutants per 10 passages). RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that a deletion event involving CT135 impacted the expression of multiple virulence factors, namely effectors known to play a role in the C. trachomatis host-cell invasion or subversion (e.g., CT456/Tarp, CT694, CT875/TepP and CT868/ChlaDub1). This reflects a scenario of attenuation of C. trachomatis virulence in vitro, which may take place independently or in a cumulative fashion with the also observed down-regulation of plasmid-related virulence factors. This issue may be relevant on behalf of the recent advances in Chlamydia mutagenesis and transformation where culture propagation for selecting mutants/transformants is mandatory. Finally, there was an increase in the growth rate for all strains, reflecting gradual fitness enhancement over time. In general, these data shed light on the adaptive process underlying the C. trachomatis in vivo to in vitro transition, and indicates that it would be prudent to restrict culture propagation to minimal passages and check the status of the CT135 genotype in order to avoid the selection of CT135-negative mutants, likely originating less virulent strains.","['Borges V', 'Pinheiro M', 'Antelo M', 'Sampaio DA', 'Vieira L', 'Ferreira R', 'Nunes A', 'Almeida F', 'Mota LJ', 'Borrego MJ', 'Gomes JP']",2015,10,7,PLoS One,"Borges V, et al.

In these patients, unusual clinical presentations such as rectal tumor or intense lymphoproliferation on rectal biopsies may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Three patients were referred to our center for the management of rectal B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the basis of a rectal pathologic specimen showing intense lymphoproliferation, the very suspect of lymphoma. Because of anamnesis of anal intercourses and venereal diseases, additional study revealed that all 3 had a positive Chlamydia trachomatis polymerase chain reaction on the rectal biopsy specimen. Rectal LGV was therefore considered and successfully treated with antibiotics. We propose that all patients presenting with a suspected rectal lymphoma should have a careful anamnesis of sexual behavior and a specific detection of C. trachomatis using polymerase chain reaction analysis on biopsy specimen to rule out the possibility of rectal LGV.","['Crickx E', 'Meignin V', 'Gérard L', 'Plantier-Colcher I', 'Walker-Combrouze F', 'Boutboul D', 'Galicier L', 'Fieschi C', 'Oksenhendler E']",2016,50,5,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Crickx E, et al.

26131720,"Bioinformatic Analysis of Chlamydia trachomatis Polymorphic Membrane Proteins PmpE, PmpF, PmpG and PmpH as Potential Vaccine Antigens.","Chlamydia trachomatis is the most important infectious cause of infertility in women with important implications in public health and for which a vaccine is urgently needed. Recent immunoproteomic vaccine studies found that four polymorphic membrane proteins (PmpE, PmpF, PmpG and PmpH) are immunodominant, recognized by various MHC class II haplotypes and protective in mouse models. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate genetic and protein features of Pmps (focusing on the N-terminal 600 amino acids where MHC class II epitopes were mapped) in order to understand antigen variation that may emerge following vaccine induced immune selection. We used several bioinformatics platforms to study: i) Pmps' phylogeny and genetic polymorphism; ii) the location and distribution of protein features (GGA(I, L)/FxxN motifs and cysteine residues) that may impact pathogen-host interactions and protein conformation; and iii) the existence of phase variation mechanisms that may impact Pmps' expression. We used a well-characterized collection of 53 fully-sequenced strains that represent the C. trachomatis serovars associated with the three disease groups: ocular (N=8), epithelial-genital (N=25) and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) (N=20). We observed that PmpF and PmpE are highly polymorphic between LGV and epithelial-genital strains, and also within populations of the latter. We also found heterogeneous representation among strains for GGA(I, L)/FxxN motifs and cysteine residues, suggesting possible alterations in adhesion properties, tissue specificity and immunogenicity. PmpG and, to a lesser extent, PmpH revealed low polymorphism and high conservation of protein features among the genital strains (including the LGV group). Uniquely among the four Pmps, pmpG has regulatory sequences suggestive of phase variation. In aggregate, the results suggest that PmpG may be the lead vaccine candidate because of sequence conservation but may need to be paired with another protective antigen (like PmpH) in order to prevent immune selection of phase variants.","['Nunes A', 'Gomes JP', 'Karunakaran KP', 'Brunham RC']",2015,10,7,PLoS One,"Nunes A, et al.

25965545,High Prevalence of Co-Infections by Invasive and Non-Invasive Chlamydia trachomatis Genotypes during the Lymphogranuloma Venereum Outbreak in Spain.,"The evolution of Chlamydia trachomatis is mainly driven by recombination events. This fact can be fuelled by the coincidence in several European regions of the high prevalence of non-invasive urogenital genotypes and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) outbreaks. This scenario could modify the local epidemiology and favor the selection of new C. trachomatis variants. Quantifying the prevalence of co-infection could help to predict the potential risk in the selection of new variants with unpredictable results in pathogenesis or transmissibility. In the 2009-2013 period, 287 clinical samples with demonstrated presence of C. trachomatis were selected. They were divided in two groups. The first group was constituted by 137 samples with C. trachomatis of the LGV genotypes, and the second by the remaining 150 samples in which the presence of LGV genotypes was previously excluded. They were analyzed to detect the simultaneous presence of non-LGV genotypes based on pmpH and ompA genes. In the first group, co-infections were detected in 10.9% of the cases whereas in the second group the prevalence was 14.6%, which is the highest percentage ever described among European countries. Moreover, bioinformatic analyses suggested the presence among men who have sex with men of a pmpH-recombinant variant, similar to strains described in Seattle in 2002. This variant was the result of genetic exchange between genotypes belonging to LGV and members of G-genotype. Sequencing of other genes, phylogenetically related to pathotype, confirmed that the putative recombinant found in Madrid could have a common origin with the strains described in Seattle. Countries with a high prevalence of co-infections and high migration flows should enhance surveillance programs in at least their vulnerable population.","['Rodriguez-Dominguez M', 'Gonzalez-Alba JM', 'Puerta T', 'Menendez B', 'Sanchez-Diaz AM', 'Canton R', 'del Romero J', 'Galan JC']",2015,10,5,PLoS One,"Rodriguez-Dominguez M, et al.

25939505,Mutational Analysis of the Chlamydia muridarum Plasticity Zone.,"Pathogenically diverse Chlamydia spp. can have surprisingly similar genomes. Chlamydia trachomatis isolates that cause trachoma, sexually transmitted genital tract infections (chlamydia), and invasive lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and the murine strain Chlamydia muridarum share 99% of their gene content. A region of high genomic diversity between Chlamydia spp. termed the plasticity zone (PZ) may encode niche-specific virulence determinants that dictate pathogenic diversity. We hypothesized that PZ genes might mediate the greater virulence and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) resistance of C. muridarum compared to C. trachomatis in the murine genital tract. To test this hypothesis, we isolated and characterized a series of C. muridarum PZ nonsense mutants. Strains with nonsense mutations in chlamydial cytotoxins, guaBA-add, and a phospholipase D homolog developed normally in cell culture. Two of the cytotoxin mutants were less cytotoxic than the wild type, suggesting that the cytotoxins may be functional. However, none of the PZ nonsense mutants exhibited increased IFN-γ sensitivity in cell culture or were profoundly attenuated in a murine genital tract infection model. Our results suggest that C. muridarum PZ genes are transcribed--and some may produce functional proteins--but are dispensable for infection of the murine genital tract.","['Rajaram K', 'Giebel AM', 'Toh E', 'Hu S', 'Newman JH', 'Morrison SG', 'Kari L', 'Morrison RP', 'Nelson DE']",2015,83,7,Infect Immun,"Rajaram K, et al.

25745888,Deep comparative genomics among Chlamydia trachomatis lymphogranuloma venereum isolates highlights genes potentially involved in pathoadaptation.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a human sexually transmitted disease caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars L1-L3). LGV clinical manifestations range from severe ulcerative proctitis (anorectal syndrome), primarily caused by the epidemic L2b strains, to painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (the typical LGV bubonic form). Besides potential host-related factors, the differential disease severity and tissue tropism among LGV strains is likely a function of the genetic backbone of the strains. We aimed to characterize the genetic variability among LGV strains as strain- or serovar-specific mutations may underlie phenotypic signatures, and to investigate the mutational events that occurred throughout the pathoadaptation of the epidemic L2b lineage. By analyzing 20 previously published genomes from L1, L2, L2b and L3 strains and two new genomes from L2b strains, we detected 1497 variant sites and about 100 indels, affecting 453 genes and 144 intergenic regions, with 34 genes displaying a clear overrepresentation of nonsynonymous mutations. Effectors and/or type III secretion substrates (almost all of those described in the literature) and inclusion membrane proteins showed amino acid changes that were about fivefold more frequent than silent changes. More than 120 variant sites occurred in plasmid-regulated virulence genes, and 66% yielded amino acid changes. The identified serovar-specific variant sites revealed that the L2b-specific mutations are likely associated with higher fitness and pointed out potential targets for future highly discriminatory diagnostic/typing tests. By evaluating the evolutionary pathway beyond the L2b clonal radiation, we observed that 90.2% of the intra-L2b variant sites occurring in coding regions involve nonsynonymous mutations, where CT456/tarp has been the main target. Considering the progress on C. trachomatis genetic manipulation, this study may constitute an important contribution for prioritizing study targets for functional genomics aiming to dissect the impact of the identified intra-LGV polymorphisms on virulence or tropism dissimilarities among LGV strains.","['Borges V', 'Gomes JP']",2015,32,,Infect Genet Evol,Borges V and Gomes JP.

OBJECTIVE: To identify trends in reported cases of chlamydia and LGV in Canada from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2012.
METHODS: Notifiable disease data on chlamydia were submitted to the Public Health Agency of Canada by provincial and territorial epidemiological units and summarized at the national level by age and sex. Confirmatory testing for suspected LGV cases and serovar subtyping were performed by the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). Where possible, provincial/territorial health authorities use a standardized national case report form to collect enhanced epidemiological data on each case and to submit the data to the Agency.
RESULTS: Rates of reported cases of chlamydia increased by 57.6%, from 189.6 to 298.7 per 100,000 between 2003 and 2012. The rate of reported cases of chlamydia among females (383.5 per 100,000) was almost twice as high as that among males (212.0 per 100,000), although the highest relative rate increase occurred among males. In both males and females, the rates of chlamydia were highest in those aged 20 to 24 years. From 2004 to 2012, 170 cases of LGV were reported to the Agency by provincial health authorities (including 104 confirmed and 66 probable cases). In 2012, case reports were received on 12 confirmed and probable cases, compared to 38 laboratory-positive cases confirmed by the NML.
CONCLUSION: In Canada, as in many countries, chlamydia rates have markedly increased over the last 10 years, in part due to improved diagnosis through nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) testing. Consistent with trends in Europe and other countries, LGV is emerging in Canada among men who have sex with men (MSM).","['Totten S', 'MacLean R', 'Payne E', 'Severini A']",2015,41,2,Can Commun Dis Rep,"Totten S, et al.

While sexually acquired reactive arthritis is well recognized following urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infections, the association with rectal infection by LGV-associated serovars of C. trachomatis has been seldom reported, and thus the organism might not be sought by clinicians. The recognition of the various clinical syndromes of LGV by all clinicians, including rheumatologists, is essential given the endemicity of LGV in European men who have sex with men.","['Perry ME', 'White JA']",2015,21,1,J Clin Rheumatol,Perry ME and White JA.

Besides frequent causative infections rare but relevant diseases in the differential diagnosis are discussed in detail.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Pubmed literature search was carried out, guidelines from different task groups and clinical experiences are presented.
RESULTS: Infections with herpes simplex virus (first) and syphilis (second) are still the most common causes of infectious genital ulcers. An endemic occurrence, previously rare in Europe, has been observed in recent years. Particular risk groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers or sex tourists are affected. Even less common locations, such as the mouth or the rectum, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and atypical clinical symptoms (e.g. pelvic pain in pelvic lymphadenopathy with LGV) must be considered in the differential diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: In recent years sexually transmitted infections (STI) have shown a significant increase in western industrialized nations. In all cases with unclear findings in the genital and anal areas (and also in the oral cavity) STI diseases must be reconsidered in the differential diagnosis.","['Malisiewicz B', 'Schöfer H']",2015,66,1,Hautarzt,Malisiewicz B and Schöfer H.

25490105,High-resolution typing of Chlamydia trachomatis: epidemiological and clinical uses.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A state-of-the-art overview of molecular Chlamydia trachomatis typing methods that are used for routine diagnostics and scientific studies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular epidemiology uses high-resolution typing techniques such as multilocus sequence typing, multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis, and whole-genome sequencing to identify strains based on their DNA sequence. These data can be used for cluster, network and phylogenetic analyses, and are used to unveil transmission networks, risk groups, and evolutionary pathways. High-resolution typing of C. trachomatis strains is applied to monitor treatment efficacy and re-infections, and to study the recent emergence of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) amongst men who have sex with men in high-income countries. Chlamydia strain typing has clinical relevance in disease management, as LGV needs longer treatment than non-LGV C. trachomatis. It has also led to the discovery of a new variant Chlamydia strain in Sweden, which was not detected by some commercial C. trachomatis diagnostic platforms.
SUMMARY: After a brief history and comparison of the various Chlamydia typing methods, the applications of the current techniques are described and future endeavors to extend scientific understanding are formulated. High-resolution typing will likely help to further unravel the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the wide clinical spectrum of chlamydial disease.","['de Vries HJ', 'Schim van der Loeff MF', 'Bruisten SM']",2015,28,1,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"de Vries HJ, et al.

25394161,Ongoing epidemic of lymphogranuloma venereum in HIV-positive men who have sex with men: how symptoms should guide treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by chlamydia trachomatis (CT) genotype L (L1, L2 and L3). Recent outbreaks of LGV in Europe and North America affected mainly men who have sex with men (MSM). Infections with CT serotypes D-K are mostly associated with mild symptoms or may be clinically silent. However, infections with L genotypes are more invasive and induce anogenital ulcer or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2003 and 2013, anal or genital CT infections were diagnosed in 471 symptomatic patients attending the Infectious Diseases Center Hamburg (ICH). CT DNA was detected by PCR. CT genotyping of positive samples was performed by sequence analyses of omp1 PCR products (samples between 2003 and 2010). Samples between 2012 and 2013 were analyzed by genotype L specific real-time PCR.
RESULTS: In total, 221 LGV patients were identified (3 in 2003; 11 in 2004; 26 in 2005; 33 in 2006; 24 in 2007; 16 in 2008; 18 in 2009; 15 in 2010; 17 in 2011; 26 in 2012 and 32 in 2013). One hundred ninety-eight of 221 (89.6%) patients with LGV were HIV-infected; 10 of 221 (4.5%) were HIV-negative, and the HIV-status unknown in 13 (5.9%). The majority of LGV positive patients (204/221; 92%) had anorectal symptoms (bloody proctitis, rectal pain, purulent or mucous discharge, tenesmus, constipation), compared to 17/221 (8%) who presented with genital symptoms as urethritis, genital ulcer or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Of 283 CT-positive patients with anorectal symptoms, genotype L was detected in 205 (72%), while non-L genotypes (D-K) were found in 78 (28%). In contrast, genotype L was found in only 6% of patients with genital symptoms (11/177), whereas 94% (166/177) were infected with non-L genotypes only.
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic of LGV among predominantly HIV+ MSM is ongoing. LGV might be underdiagnosed, especially in patients with anorectal symptoms. Infections with CT serotypes D-K are more often associated with urogenital symptoms or asymptomatic infection, whereas LGV genotypes are found most frequently in patients with rectal/intestinal symptoms. Anorectal CT infections in MSM should be further characterized by genotyping for LGV, as for LGV three weeks of doxycycline treatment are recommended. CT genotypes D-K generally require shorter antibiotic treatment. If CT genotyping is not available, the duration of treatment should be prolonged to three weeks empirically for CT-positive patients with anorectal or intestinal symptoms.","['Mohrmann G', 'Noah C', 'Sabranski M', 'Sahly H', 'Stellbrink HJ']",2014,17,4 Suppl 3,J Int AIDS Soc,"Mohrmann G, et al.

A cross-sectional study followed by a cohort study of untreated STI clinic patients in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.","OBJECTIVES: Pharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) might contribute to ongoing chlamydia transmission, yet data on spontaneous clearance duration are rare. We examined the prevalence, spontaneous clearance, chlamydial DNA concentration and genotypes of pharyngeal chlamydia among clinic patients with sexually transmitted infection (STI).
METHODS: Female patients at high risk for an STI who reported active oral sex and male patients who have sex with men (MSM) were screened for pharyngeal chlamydia RNA using a nucleic acid amplification test. A repeat swab was obtained to evaluate spontaneous clearance in untreated patients with pharyngeal chlamydia. Quantitative chlamydia DNA load was determined by calculating the chlamydia/human cell ratio.
RESULTS: Pharyngeal chlamydia was detected in 148/13 111 (1.1%) MSM and in 160/6915 (2.3%) women. 53% of MSM and 32% of women with pharyngeal chlamydia did not have a concurrent anogenital chlamydia infection. In 16/43 (37%) MSM and in 20/55 (36%) women, the repeat pharyngeal swab was negative (median follow-up 10 days, range 4-58 days). Patients with an initial chlamydial DNA concentration above the median were less likely to clear. Of 23 MSM with pharyngeal chlamydia who had sex with a lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)-positive partner recently or in the past, two were LGV biovar positive (8.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: The pharynx is a reservoir for chlamydia and LGV, and may play a role in ongoing transmission. Although delay in ribosomal RNA decline after resolution of the infection might have led to an underestimation of spontaneous clearance, in high-risk STI clinic patients, testing the pharynx for chlamydia should be considered.","['van Rooijen MS', 'van der Loeff MF', 'Morré SA', 'van Dam AP', 'Speksnijder AG', 'de Vries HJ']",2015,91,3,Sex Transm Infect,"van Rooijen MS, et al.

24915990,"No evidence for LGV transmission among heterosexuals in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.","BACKGROUND: In recent years a few cases of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in heterosexuals in Europe have been reported. It is not known whether LGV transmission among heterosexuals occurs on a wider scale.
METHODS: Heterosexual male and female STI clinic clients (n = 587) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) were screened for IgA anti-MOMP in serum. If the value was above the cut-off index (2.0) the patient's CT positive urogenital, ocular or rectal sample(s) were selected and tested for LGV by an in-house LGV-specific NAAT.
RESULTS: Sera of 126 patients were above 2.0 COI. Some patients had >1 CT positive sample. Samples could not be retrieved from 15 of the 126 persons, and 7 samples that were found positive for CT in the diagnostic amplification process could not be confirmed and hence not typed. We did not find a single case of LGV infection in 123 urogenital, ocular or rectal samples from 104 patients.

24787368,Pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of inguinal lymphogranuloma venereum: important lessons from a case series.,"Current lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) guidelines mainly focus on anorectal infections. Inguinal LGV infections have been rare in the current epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM), but might require a different approach not yet recommended in current guidelines for the treatment and diagnosis of LGV. We describe 4 inguinal LGV cases. Three MSM developed inguinal LGV infection several weeks after a previous consultation, of which two had received azithromycin after being notified for LGV. Three failed the recommended 21 days doxycycline treatment. These inguinal LGV cases highlight 3 pitfalls in the current standard management of LGV: (1) Urethral chlamydia infections in MSM can be caused by LGV biovars that in contrast to non-LGV biovars require prolonged antibiotic therapy. (2) The recommended one gram azithromycin contact treatment seems insufficient to prevent established infections. (3) Inguinal LGV may require prolonged courses of doxycycline, exceeding the currently advised 21 days regimen.","['Oud EV', 'de Vrieze NH', 'de Meij A', 'de Vries HJ']",2014,90,4,Sex Transm Infect,"Oud EV, et al.

24716676,Prevalence and predictors of Lymphogranuloma venereum in a high risk population attending a STD outpatients clinic in Italy.,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated LGV prevalence and predictors in a high risk population attending a STI Outpatients Clinic in the North of Italy.
METHODS: A total of 108 patients (99 MSM and 9 women), with a history of unsafe anal sexual intercourses, were enrolled. Anorectal swabs and urine samples were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) DNA detection by Versant CT/GC DNA 1.0 Assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Terrytown, USA). RFLP analysis was used for CT molecular typing.
RESULTS: L2 CT genotype was identified in 13/108 (12%) rectal swabs. All LGV cases were from MSM, declaring high-risk sexual behaviour and complaining anorectal symptoms. Patients first attending the STI Outpatient Clinic received a significant earlier LGV diagnosis than those first seeking care from general practitioners or gastroenterologists (P = 0.0046). LGV prevalence and characteristics found in our population are in agreement with international reports. Statistical analysis showed that LGV positive patients were older (P = 0.0008) and presented more STIs (P = 0.0023) than LGV negative ones, in particular due to syphilis (P < 0.001), HIV (P < 0.001) and HBV (P = 0.001).Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that HIV and syphilis infections are strong risk factors for LGV presence (respectively, P = 0.001 and P = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: Even if our results do not provide sufficient evidence to recommend routine screening of anorectal swabs in high-risk population, they strongly suggest to perform CT NAAT tests and genotyping on rectal specimens in presence of ulcerative proctitis in HIV and/or syphilis-positive MSM. In this context, CT DNA detection by Versant CT/GC DNA 1.0 Assay, followed by RFLP analysis for molecular typing demonstrated to be an excellent diagnostic algorithm for LGV identification.","['Foschi C', 'Marangoni A', ""D'Antuono A"", 'Nardini P', 'Compri M', 'Bellavista S', 'Filippini A', 'Bacchi Reggiani ML', 'Cevenini R']",2014,7,,BMC Res Notes,"Foschi C, et al.

All cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction technique in rectal tissue. Endoscopic images obtained showed a great variety of rectal lesions, from mild erythema of the mucosa and ulcers to deep ulcers with elevated borders and purulent exudate.

24687130,Clinical predictors of rectal lymphogranuloma venereum infection: results from a multicentre case-control study in the U.K.,"OBJECTIVE: Since 2003, over 2000 cases of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) have been diagnosed in the U.K. in men who have sex with men (MSM). Most cases present with proctitis, but there are limited data on how to differentiate clinically between LGV and other pathology. We analysed the clinical presentations of rectal LGV in MSM to identify clinical characteristics predictive of LGV proctitis and produced a clinical prediction model.
DESIGN: A prospective multicentre case-control study was conducted at six U.K. hospitals from 2008 to 2010. Cases of rectal LGV were compared with controls with rectal symptoms but without LGV.
METHODS: Data from 98 LGV cases and 81 controls were collected from patients and clinicians using computer-assisted self-interviews and clinical report forms. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to compare symptoms and signs. Clinical prediction models for LGV were compared using receiver operating curves.
RESULTS: Tenesmus, constipation, anal discharge and weight loss were significantly more common in cases than controls. In multivariate analysis, tenesmus and constipation alone were suggestive of LGV (OR 2.98, 95% CI 0.99 to 8.98 and 2.87, 95% CI 1.01 to 8.15, respectively) and that tenesmus alone or in combination with constipation was a significant predictor of LGV (OR 6.97, 95% CI 2.71 to 17.92). The best clinical prediction was having one or more of tenesmus, constipation and exudate on proctoscopy, with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 65%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that tenesmus alone or in combination with constipation makes a diagnosis of LGV in MSM presenting with rectal symptoms more likely.","['Pallawela SN', 'Sullivan AK', 'Macdonald N', 'French P', 'White J', 'Dean G', 'Smith A', 'Winter AJ', 'Mandalia S', 'Alexander S', 'Ison C', 'Ward H']",2014,90,4,Sex Transm Infect,"Pallawela SN, et al.

EPIDEMIOLOGY: Based on clonal relatedness of prevalent LGV strains there is evidence that the LGV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Western world prevailed already in the United States in the 1980s and was introduced into Europe by the end of the last century.
AETIOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION: A new LGV variant causing severe proctitis was unveiled and designated L2c. The L2b LGV variant causing the vast majority of infections among MSM is now also found among a few heterosexual women.
MANAGEMENT: Apart from HIV and STI screening, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) testing should be offered to all LGV patients. To exclude reinfections, STI screening during a follow-up visit 3 months after an LGV diagnosis should be offered.","['de Vries HJ', 'Zingoni A', 'Kreuter A', 'Moi H', 'White JA', 'European Branch of the International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology', 'European Dermatology Forum', 'European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases', 'Union of European Medical Specialists', 'European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control', 'European Office of the World Health Organisation']",2015,29,1,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"de Vries HJ, et al. 2013 European guideline on the management of lymphogranuloma venereum. 2013 European guideline on the management of lymphogranuloma venereum. 2015; 29:1-6. doi: 10.1111/jdv.12461",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24661352/
24655220,Lymphogranuloma venereum among men who have sex with men. An epidemiological and clinical review.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection, previously only seen in tropical regions. This changed in 2003 when the first endemically acquired LGV cases were reported in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, among predominantly HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Early diagnosis is important to prevent irreversible complications and to stop further transmission in the community. In contrast to earlier reports, approximately 25% of LGV infections are asymptomatic and form an easily missed undetected reservoir. The majority of reported infections in MSM are found in the anorectal canal and not urogenital, which leaves the mode of transmission within the MSM network unclear. Given the increasing trend, the LGV endemic is clearly not under control. Therefore directed screening must be intensified.","['de Vrieze NH', 'de Vries HJ']",2014,12,6,Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,de Vrieze NH and de Vries HJ.

Epidemiological, clinical and sexual behaviour characteristics of LGV cases are described. Seroadaptive behaviours as a transmission risk factor were assessed by a telephone questionnaire during 2012. Data were handled on a strictly confidential basis. LGV annual rate ratios in MSM were compared with cases from 2007. Differences were statistically analysed with a Poisson test. The incidence rate of LGV in MSM aged 15-69 years ranged from 32·1/105 MSM per year in 2007 to 182·7/105 MSM per year in 2012. In 2012, 31/51 LGV cases (61%) answered the telephone questionnaire, of which 84% (26/31) were HIV positive, 39% (12/31) reported having sex according to their partners' serostatus and 7% (2/31) used strategic positioning.

24518282,"Lymphogranuloma venereum: an old, forgotten re-emerging systemic disease.","Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, South America, and the Caribbean, but once was rarely observed in Western countries, where most cases were considered to be imported. However, recent outbreaks have been reported in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada, mainly among HIV positive men who have sex with men, signaling LGV re-emergence. The etiological agent of LGV is Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1, L2 and L3, and current outbreaks are mostly sustained by L2b type. The clinical course can be classically divided into three stages: an initial papule, which may ulcerate at the site of inoculation, followed by regional lymphoadenopathy (second stage, generally unilateral). In the tertiary stage, lymphatic obstruction, with elephantiasis of genitalia, and rectal involvement can lead to the formation of strictures and fistulae that may require surgical treatment. Recent cases are observed mainly among HIV positive people, often co-infected with HCV and others STIs, engaging in high-risk sexual practices. The main clinical picture is a relative new entity characterized by progressive ulcerative proctitis, the so called anorectal syndrome. Diagnosis is often delayed, requires a high index of clinical suspicion and must rely on the use of nucleic acid amplification tests. The differential diagnosis of proctitis should include LGV infection. Gastroenterologists, coloproctologists, dermatologists and other specialists need to be aware of LGV proctitis to avoid diagnostic delay and progression of disease to the tertiary stage.","['Dal Conte I', 'Mistrangelo M', 'Cariti C', 'Chiriotto M', 'Lucchini A', 'Vigna M', 'Morino M', 'Di Perri G']",2014,56,1,Panminerva Med,"Dal Conte I, et al.

24493859,Risk factors for rectal lymphogranuloma venereum in gay men: results of a multicentre case-control study in the U.K.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for rectal lymphogranuloma venereum (rLGV) in men who have sex with men (MSM).
DESIGN: A case-control study at 6 U.K. hospitals compared MSM with rLGV (cases) with rLGV-negative controls: MSM without potential rLGV symptoms (CGa) and separately, MSM with such symptoms (CGs).
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, there were 90 rLGV cases, 74 CGa and 69 CGs recruited. Lifestyles and sexual behaviours in the previous 3 months were reported using internet-based computer-assisted self-interviews. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with rLGV.
RESULTS: Cases were significantly more likely to be HIV-positive (89%) compared with CGa (46%) and CGs (64%). Independent behavioural risks for rLGV were: unprotected receptive anal intercourse (adjusted OR (AOR)10.7, 95% CI 3.5 to 32.8), fisting another (AOR=6.7, CI 1.8 to 25.3), sex under the influence of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (AOR=3.1, CI 1.3 to 7.4) and anonymous sexual contacts (AOR=2.7, CI 1.2 to 6.3), compared with CGa; unprotected insertive anal intercourse (AOR=4.7, CI 2.0 to 10.9) and rectal douching (AOR=2.9 CI 1.3 to 6.6), compared with CGs. An incubation period from exposure to symptoms of 30 days was indicated.
CONCLUSIONS: Unprotected receptive anal intercourse is a key risk factor for rectal LGV with the likelihood that rectal-to-rectal transmission is facilitated where insertive anal sex also occurs. The association between HIV and rLGV appears linked to HIV-positive men seeking unprotected sex with others with the same HIV status, sexual and drug interests. Such men should be targeted for frequent STI screening and interventions to minimise associated risks.","['Macdonald N', 'Sullivan AK', 'French P', 'White JA', 'Dean G', 'Smith A', 'Winter AJ', 'Alexander S', 'Ison C', 'Ward H']",2014,90,4,Sex Transm Infect,"Macdonald N, et al.

24431182,Characteristics of LGV repeaters: analysis of LGV surveillance data.,"OBJECTIVES: A number of individuals have acquired lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) infection multiple times since its re-emergence. We describe the characteristics of reinfections and those who acquire them.
METHODS: The LGV Enhanced Surveillance system collected detailed information on LGV episodes in the U.K. from 2004 to 2010. Using logistic regression we compared the baseline characteristics of men who have sex with men (MSM) who had a repeat LGV episode ('repeaters') to MSM with a single reported episode ('non-repeaters').
RESULTS: There were 66 individuals among the 1281 MSM (5.2%) with LGV episode who had a recorded reinfection during the data collection period. Those who acquired LGV reinfection were more likely to be HIV positive (97% vs 79%), visit a clinic in London (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.8), and have hepatitis C (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.6) or concurrent gonorrhoea (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.8) on their first recorded LGV episode. Repeaters reported higher levels of unprotected sex, but behavioural variables were not significantly different between repeaters and non-repeaters.
CONCLUSIONS: Among LGV repeaters, risk behaviour alone did not explain subsequent reinfection. LGV repeaters have a high level of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which may be linked to their central position in the sexual network that contributes to their heightened risk of STI acquisition. Given the low prevalence of LGV in the general MSM population, momentary increases in incidence in subsets of the population may be an important factor for LGV risk where the overall level of sexual risk behaviour is higher. Validating this would require research into sexual network structures.","['Rönn M', 'Hughes G', 'White P', 'Simms I', 'Ison C', 'Ward H']",2014,90,4,Sex Transm Infect,"Rönn M, et al.

METHODS: An epidemic curve of all LGV diagnoses between 2003 and mid-2012 was plotted and divided into the initial detection period, and endemic, growth and hyperendemic phases. Detailed clinical and behavioural data were collected and logistic regression was used to compare the characteristics of diagnoses made during the growth and endemic phases.
RESULTS: Between April 2003 and June 2012, 2138 cases of LGV were diagnosed. Enhanced surveillance data were available for 1370 of whom 1353 were men who have sex with men (MSM). 98% of MSM presented with proctitis, 82% were HIV positive, 20% were hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive, and 67% lived in London. Growth phase cases (n=488) were more likely to report meeting sexual contacts at sex parties (11% vs. 6%, p=0.014), unprotected receptive or insertive oral intercourse (93% vs. 86%, p=0.001; 92% vs. 85%, p=0.001) and sharing sex toys (8% vs 4%; p=0.011), and to be diagnosed HIV positive (86% vs. 80%; p=0.014), than endemic phase cases (n=423). Unprotected receptive anal intercourse was equally likely to be reported in both phases (71% vs. 73%). After adjustment, cases in the growth phase were more likely to meet new contacts at sex parties (p=0.031) and be HIV positive (p=0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid epidemic growth coincided with an intensification of unprotected sexual activity among a core population of HIV-positive MSM.

23798024,[Anorectal manifestations of sexually transmitted infections].,"The incidence of sexually transmitted infections is rising in Europe and in Switzerland since the beginning of the third millenium. Many organisms may affect the perianal skin and the anorectum. While some of these infections are a result of contigous spread from genital infection, most result from receptive anal intercourse affecting males who have sex with males but is seen increasingly in females as well since there is evidence of the increasing popularity of anal sex among heterosexuals. The symptoms of specific infections are largely dependent on the route and site of inoculation. Organisms that cause typical genital symptoms - such as syphilis, chancroid, herpes simplex or HPV-infection - result in similar symptoms when the perianal skin, the anoderm or the distal anal canal are the site of infection. Patients with proctitis may have unspecific signs in various degrees including mucous discharge, rectal bleeding, anorectal pain, superficial ulcers and sometimes generalized lymphadenopathy and fever. It is of utmost importance to include STIs (e. g. lymphogranuloma venereum, gonorrhea, non-LGV-chlamydia and herpes simplex) in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Unfortunately rectal infection with chlamydia and gonorrhea is asymptomatic in the majority of cases of men having sex with men and in high-risk females. A careful history and physical examination is essential in establishing a correct diagnosis, usually supported by proctoscopy, culture, PCR, serology and histology.

DESIGN: Retrospective and descriptive study of all swabs obtained from all MSM attendees at an STI unit, from 2007 to 2011. Retrospective ethical approval was granted by the Ethical Regional Committee of Clinical Investigation of the Principality of Asturias.
SETTING: The STI clinic in Oviedo, Spain, offers screening and free-of-charge treatment to about 3646 patients per year.
PARTICIPANTS: 303 symptomatic and asymptomatic consecutive and unselected MSM patients (mean age 36.7 and range 21-55 years) were evaluated for anorectal chlamydial infection.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: C trachomatis DNA extraction and detection in all rectal and in 36 urethral swabs. Characterisation of C trachomatis genotypes through sequencing of ompA gene amplicons and further phylogenetic tree analysis.
RESULTS: We found 40 (13. 2%) positive rectal samples. The distribution of genotypes was E (37. 5%) followed by G (25%), D (12. 5%), J (10%) and L2b (5%).25 (62.5%, 95% CI 46.2 to 78.7) of the chlamydia-infected MSM showed clinical manifestations while 15 (37.5%, 95% CI 21.25 to 53.75) reported no symptoms. Concurrent infection with other STIs was documented in 27 (67.5%, 95% CI 51.7 to 83.2) patients. The most frequently reported clinical symptom was anal ulcer (7 cases, 17.5%; 95% CI 4.47 to 30.52). E genotype was mostly detected in asymptomatic patients. There were non-E genotypes detected in 21 (84%, 95% CI 63.9 to 95.5) of 25 symptomatic patients (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The first two confirmed cases of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in MSM in Asturias are reported, probably indicating the increase of this infection.

This study investigates whether distinct C. trachomatis strains circulate among subpopulations within the MSM community.
METHODS: Participants were recruited at the sexually transmitted infection clinic of the Public Health Service of Amsterdam from 2008 to 2009. C. trachomatis samples were typed using multilocus sequence typing. Epidemiological and clinical data were derived from questionnaires and patient records.
RESULTS: Typing of 277 samples from 260 MSM identified distinct C. trachomatis strains circulating concurrently over time. Men with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)-inducing strains were more likely to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, more often had a history of STI, and had a higher frequency of risky sexual behavior. No such associations were found for non-LGV-inducing strains. MSM infected with heterosexual-associated strains were often younger (P = .04) and more often reported sex with women (P = .03), compared with men infected with MSM-associated strains.
CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of LGV-inducing strains, no evidence was found that different C. trachomatis strains circulated in distinct subpopulations of MSM. This indicates that no separate transmission networks for C. trachomatis among MSM existed. However, younger MSM and bisexuals were more often infected with heterosexual-associated C. trachomatis strains.","['Bom RJ', 'Matser A', 'Bruisten SM', 'van Rooijen MS', 'Heijman T', 'Morré SA', 'de Vries HJ', 'Schim van der Loeff MF']",2013,208,6,J Infect Dis,"Bom RJ, et al.

Although international surveillance programmes were implemented, these studies slowly decreased in the following years. Now data have revealed a new accumulation of LGV cases in those European countries with extended surveillance programmes. Between March 2009 and November 2011, a study was carried out to detect LGV cases in Madrid. The study was based on screening of C. trachomatis using commercial kits, followed by real-time pmpH-PCR discriminating LGV strains, and finally ompA gene was sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction. Ninety-four LGV infections were identified. The number of cases increased from 10 to 30 and then to 54 during 2009-2011. Incidence of LGV was strongly associated with men who have sex with men; but in 2011, LGV cases were described in women and heterosexual men. Sixty-nine patients were also human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, with detectable viral loads at the moment of LGV diagnosis, suggesting a high-risk of co-transmission. In fact, in four patients the diagnosis of HIV was simultaneous with LGV infection. The conventional treatment with doxycycline was prescribed in 75 patients, although in three patients the treatment failed. The sequencing of the ompA gene permitted identification of two independent transmission nodes. One constituted by 25 sequences identical to the L2b variant, and a second node including 37 sequences identical to L2.

23590987,Assessment of the load and transcriptional dynamics of Chlamydia trachomatis plasmid according to strains' tissue tropism.,"Chlamydia trachomatis maintain a conserved plasmid, which is a primary regulator of chromosomal genes, but there is no experimental evidences associating it with the strains' differential tissue tropism (ocular and genital mucosae, and lymph nodes). We investigated if the number of plasmids per strain correlate with expression profiles of plasmid ORFs and small anti-sense RNAs (sRNAs), and also if these molecular features underlie tropism dissimilarities. We performed absolute and relative qPCR to determine both the plasmid load and expression throughout C. trachomatis development. Our findings suggest that plasmid load (never exceeding 8 copies) is not a function of expression needs and does not reflect tissue tropism. However, for most ORFs, ocular strains presented lower expression than genital or lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) strains, and ORF6/pgp4 (transcriptional regulator of virulence associated genes) presented the highest mean expression among strains, followed by the virulence factor ORF5/pgp3 (also regulated by ORF6/pgp4). More, the mean expression levels of the sRNA-2 (anti-sense to ORF2/pgp8) were up to 100-fold higher than those of the ORFs, and up to 12-fold higher than that of sRNA-7 (anti-sense to ORF7/pgp5) for the LGV strains. Overall, besides the known regulatory role of C. trachomatis plasmid, its transcriptional dynamics sustains tropism differences.","['Ferreira R', 'Borges V', 'Nunes A', 'Borrego MJ', 'Gomes JP']",2013,168,6,Microbiol Res,"Ferreira R, et al.

Anal symptoms were reported for 16 out of 75 (21.3%) of anal chlamydia episodes overall. Three episodes of LGV (all serovar L2b) were identified, all three of whom reported anal symptoms (100%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 29.2-100%). In contrast, only 13/72 (18.1%, 95% CI: 10.0-28.9%) of those with non-LGV anal chlamydia reported anal symptoms. LGV was not identified in any of 59 episodes of asymptomatic anal chlamydia (0%, 95% CI: 0-6.1%). Of those with LGV, two were known to be HIV-positive and one subsequently seroconverted to HIV within a year of the LGV diagnosis.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. In two HIV clinics, new STIs were recorded for three consecutive 12-month periods between 2009 and 2012 in a cohort of 882 HIV-infected patients. These three years coincided with the introduction of enhanced STI screening based on prompts within the electronic patient record (EPR) system.
RESULTS: The number of diagnoses and the incidence of STIs more than doubled between 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 in both men who have sex with men (MSM) [from 18 of 115 (15%) to 42 of 132 (32%), a rise in STI incidence from 15.6 to 31.8/100 person-years; P < 0.001] and heterosexual patients [from six of 716 (0.8%) to 19 of 749 (2.5%), a rise in STI incidence from 0.8 to 2.5/100 person-years; P < 0.005]. The rise was significant in MSM for infections with chlamydia [from seven of 115 (6%) to 14 of 132 (11%), a rise in incidence from 6.0 to 10.6/100 person-years; P < 0.05], gonorrhoea [from five of 115 (4%) to 12 of 132 (9%), a rise in STI incidence from 4.3 to 9.1/100 person-years; P < 0.05] and early syphilis [from four of 115 (3%) to 13 of 132 (10%), a rise in incidence from 3.5 to 9.8/100 person-years; P < 0.001], but not for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) infections.

METHODS: We included MSM consultations from whom a swab (from anorectum, bubo or an genital ulcer) was taken for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) screening. Anorectal swabs were taken from all MSM who reported receptive anorectal intercourse in the preceding 6 months. Ct positive samples were further tested with a pmpH PCR to identify L-genovars. Patient symptoms, clinical and anoscopic inflammatory signs, and STI co-infections were noted; Gram-stained anorectal mucosal smears were examined.
RESULTS: Between January 2005 and June 2012, 48 570 consultations among MSM were conducted. In 3628/35 650 visits, anorectal Ct infections were diagnosed, including 411 anal LGV (1.2%). Moreover, 65/1649 genital ulcer swabs were Ct positive; 10 were inguinal LGV (0.6%) Since January 2011 a significant increase in the positivity of LGV occurred (p<0.0001). 89 (27.2%) anorectal LGV cases were asymptomatic. HIV prevalence among anorectal LGV cases was significantly higher (p=0.008) than among inguinal LGV cases. STI co-morbidity in anorectal LGV cases remained invariably high during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Since January 2011, LGV positivity in MSM consultations in Amsterdam has risen significantly. The great majority comprise anal LGV; inguinal LGV is rare.

Voluntary networks of physicians (RésIST) and laboratories (Rénago, Rénachla, lymphogranuloma venereum: LGV network) produce indicators showing the evolution of the main bacterial STIs. In 2010, the main findings were the following. The number of gonococcal infections has increased throughout the decade 2000 to 2010. The decrease in susceptibility of gonococcal strains to first-line antibiotics (extended-spectrum cephalosporins) needs to keep great attention. The number of screening and diagnosis of chlamydial urogenital infections also continues to rise in both sexes, particularly due to increased screening among young people. The relatively stable number of cases of early syphilis and of rectal LGV needs to be confirmed over the coming years. Both of these STIs affect overwhelmingly homo/bisexual men. There is still a high level of HIV co-infection with LGV and syphilis, and to a lesser extent with gonorrhea. We observe that condom use is still inadequate, especially during oral sex.","['La Ruche G', 'Goulet V', 'Bouyssou A', 'Sednaoui P', 'De Barbeyrac B', 'Dupin N', 'Semaille C']",2013,42,4 Pt 1,Presse Med,"La Ruche G, et al.

23095509,Syphilitic and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) proctocolitis: clues to a frequently missed diagnosis.,"A rising incidence of syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) underscores the importance of recognizing these sexually transmitted infections (STI) in routine anocolonic biopsies. To increase awareness of their morphologic manifestations, we undertook a clinicopathologic study of our experience: syphilis (7 patients, 7 specimens), LGV (2 patients, 4 specimens), and syphilis/LGV (1 patient, 3 specimens). The diagnoses of all study specimens were confirmed with pertinent clinical studies. All study patients were human immunodeficiency virus positive, and all 9 with available history were men who have sex with men. The majority presented with bleeding (9), pain (6), and tenesmus (4). Ulcerations were the most common endoscopic abnormality (7), whereas mass lesions were confined to the syphilis group (4). None of the initial impressions included LGV, and syphilis was prospectively suggested only by pathologists (6 of 8) without the knowledge of clinical information and on the basis of morphology. Alternative impressions included condyloma acuminatum (3), inflammatory bowel disease (3), and malignancy (2), among others. All study specimens shared the following histologic core features: an intense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with prominent plasma cells and lymphoid aggregates, only mild to moderate acute inflammation, minimal basal plasmacytosis and crypt distortion, and only rare granulomas and Paneth cell metaplasia. The spirochetes were focally demonstrated on a Treponema pallidum immunohistochemical stain (1) but not on silver stains (3). All patients with available follow-up data showed resolution of symptoms and imaging abnormalities after STI therapy (6). In summary, we report a unique pattern of STI proctocolitis consistently identified in patients with serologically confirmed syphilis and/or LGV infection; pertinent STI therapy leads to resolution of clinical abnormalities. This histologic pattern is important to recognize for timely treatment, for prevention of onward STI transmission, and to avoid the diagnostic pitfalls of inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy.","['Arnold CA', 'Limketkai BN', 'Illei PB', 'Montgomery E', 'Voltaggio L']",2013,37,1,Am J Surg Pathol,"Arnold CA, et al.

23042990,Polymorphisms in inc proteins and differential expression of inc genes among Chlamydia trachomatis strains correlate with invasiveness and tropism of lymphogranuloma venereum isolates.,"Chlamydia trachomatis is a human bacterial pathogen that multiplies only within an intracellular membrane-bound vacuole, the inclusion. C. trachomatis includes ocular and urogenital strains, usually causing infections restricted to epithelial cells of the conjunctiva and genital mucosa, respectively, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) strains, which can infect macrophages and spread into lymph nodes. However, C. trachomatis genomes display >98% identity at the DNA level. In this work, we studied whether C. trachomatis Inc proteins, which have a bilobed hydrophobic domain that may mediate their insertion in the inclusion membrane, could be a factor determining these different types of infection and tropisms. Analyses of polymorphisms and phylogeny of 48 Inc proteins from 51 strains encompassing the three disease groups showed significant amino acid differences that were mainly due to variations between Inc proteins from LGV and ocular or urogenital isolates. Studies of the evolutionary dynamics of inc genes suggested that 10 of them are likely under positive selection and indicated that most nonsilent mutations are LGV specific. Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR analyses in prototype and clinical strains covering the three disease groups identified three inc genes with LGV-specific expression. We determined the transcriptional start sites of these genes and found LGV-specific nucleotides within their promoters. Thus, subtle variations in the amino acids of a subset of Inc proteins and in the expression of inc genes may contribute to the unique tropism and invasiveness of C. trachomatis LGV strains.","['Almeida F', 'Borges V', 'Ferreira R', 'Borrego MJ', 'Gomes JP', 'Mota LJ']",2012,194,23,J Bacteriol,"Almeida F, et al.

In this article we give an update of the diagnostic means and therapeutic challenges that are of interest for the clinician. Besides these (re)-emerging diseases we touch on Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Herpes Simplex (HSV). This selection of diseases is based on the daily experience of the clinicians working in the STI clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp. Data and clinical guidelines are derived from the Scientific Institute of Public Health in Brussels, the European and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Guidelines of the Flemish Agency for Care and Health. New evolutions in diagnostics, prevention and treatment options make it necessary to regularly update the knowledge of this group of diseases, especially when they are complicated by HIV co-infection.

However, there is no gene transfer system for Chlamydia to help identify potential vaccine targets. To accelerate discoveries toward this goal, here we analyzed the broadest diversity of C. trachomatis genomes to date, including 25 geographically dispersed clinical and seven reference strains representing 14 of the 19 known serotypes. Strikingly, all 32 genomes were found to have evidence of DNA acquisition by homologous recombination in their history. Four distinct clades were identified, which correspond to all C. trachomatis disease phenotypes: lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV; Clade 1); noninvasive urogenital infections (Clade 2); ocular trachoma (Clade 3); and protocolitis (Clade 4; also includes some noninvasive urogenital infections). Although the ancestral relationship between clades varied, most strains acted as donor and recipient of recombination with no evidence for barriers to genetic exchange. The niche-specific LGV and trachoma clades have undergone less recombination, although the opportunity for mixing with strains from other clades that infect the rectal and ocular mucosa, respectively, is evident. Furthermore, there are numerous occasions for gene conversion events through sequential infections at the same anatomic sites. The size of recombinant segments is relatively small (~357 bp) compared with in vitro experiments of various C. trachomatis strains but is consistent with in vitro estimates for other bacterial species including Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori. Selection has also played a crucial role during the diversification of the organism. Clade 2 had the lowest nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio (dN/dS) but the highest effect of recombination, which is consistent with the widespread occurrence of synonymous substitutions in recombined genomic segments. The trachoma Clade 3 had the highest dN/dS estimates, which may be caused by an increased effect of genetic drift from niche specialization and a reduced effective population size. The degree of drift, selection, and recombination in C. trachomatis suggests that the challenge will remain to identify genomic regions that are stable and cross protective for the development of an efficacious vaccine.","['Joseph SJ', 'Didelot X', 'Rothschild J', 'de Vries HJ', 'Morré SA', 'Read TD', 'Dean D']",2012,29,12,Mol Biol Evol,"Joseph SJ, et al.

22517888,Genotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis in rectal and pharyngeal specimens: identification of LGV genotypes in Finland.,"OBJECTIVES: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis L types have recently emerged in Europe among HIV-positive men having sex with men. Our aim was to introduce a genotyping strategy suitable for a diagnostic laboratory using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detection of C trachomatis and to investigate the prevalence of LGV types in rectal and pharyngeal specimens in Finland.
METHODS: Aptima Combo 2 (Gen-Probe) was used to detect C trachomatis in swabs. Altogether 140 C trachomatis NAAT-positive rectal and pharyngeal samples were genotyped by pmpH and ompA real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Of the 140 NAAT-positive rectal and pharyngeal specimens, 114 (81%) were successfully typed by pmpH PCR. One hundred and four samples contained non-LGV, nine samples LGV and one sample both non-LGV and LGV C trachomatis types. The C trachomatis LGV types were mainly found in rectal samples. Six of the L types were confirmed to be genotype L2b and two were L2 with ompA PCR and sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that genotyping C trachomatis by pmpH PCR can be introduced as a function of a diagnostic laboratory already using NAAT for detection of C trachomatis. The data show that LGV infections occur also in Finland. LGV should be taken into account when considering treatment and management of rectal C trachomatis infections.","['Korhonen S', 'Hiltunen-Back E', 'Puolakkainen M']",2012,88,6,Sex Transm Infect,"Korhonen S, et al.

22406642,Whole-genome analysis of diverse Chlamydia trachomatis strains identifies phylogenetic relationships masked by current clinical typing.,"Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for both trachoma and sexually transmitted infections, causing substantial morbidity and economic cost globally. Despite this, our knowledge of its population and evolutionary genetics is limited. Here we present a detailed phylogeny based on whole-genome sequencing of representative strains of C. trachomatis from both trachoma and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovars from temporally and geographically diverse sources. Our analysis shows that predicting phylogenetic structure using ompA, which is traditionally used to classify Chlamydia, is misleading because extensive recombination in this region masks any true relationships present. We show that in many instances, ompA is a chimera that can be exchanged in part or as a whole both within and between biovars. We also provide evidence for exchange of, and recombination within, the cryptic plasmid, which is another key diagnostic target. We used our phylogenetic framework to show how genetic exchange has manifested itself in ocular, urogenital and LGV C. trachomatis strains, including the epidemic LGV serotype L2b.","['Harris SR', 'Clarke IN', 'Seth-Smith HM', 'Solomon AW', 'Cutcliffe LT', 'Marsh P', 'Skilton RJ', 'Holland MJ', 'Mabey D', 'Peeling RW', 'Lewis DA', 'Spratt BG', 'Unemo M', 'Persson K', 'Bjartling C', 'Brunham R', 'de Vries HJ', 'Morré SA', 'Speksnijder A', 'Bébéar CM', 'Clerc M', 'de Barbeyrac B', 'Parkhill J', 'Thomson NR']",2012,44,4,Nat Genet,"Harris SR, et al.

21700742,Differences in Chlamydia trachomatis growth rates in human keratinocytes among lymphogranuloma venereum reference strains and clinical isolates.,"The pathogenesis of the primary stage of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is poorly understood. There is no skin cell model and LGV pathogenesis studies are therefore carried out on cells of different origin. Moreover, such studies usually use reference strains, which may have evolved over the years in culture. In this study, a model was developed in which Chlamydia trachomatis enters and grows in human keratinocytes at 37 and 33 °C. Keratinocytes were infected with fresh clinical isolates and the three LGV reference strains L1, L2 and L3. Growth was monitored for 5 days post-infection using fluorescence microscopy and image analysis software. Chlamydial replication was quicker at 37 than at 33 °C, despite 33 °C being the temperature of human skin. The serovar L2 reference strain grew significantly faster than the other strains, although the fresh clinical isolates were also serovar L2. When grown in keratinocytes at 33 °C, the L2 and L3 reference strains produced much larger inclusions than the other strains tested. This model, which utilizes keratinocytes, better simulates the conditions present at the initial site of infection in LGV than previously published literature, making it a useful tool for future LGV pathogenesis studies. In addition, the results indicate that fresh clinical isolates should be included in LGV pathogenesis studies.","['Joubert BC', 'Sturm AW']",2011,60,Pt 11,J Med Microbiol,Joubert BC and Sturm AW.

21540364,Hypervirulent Chlamydia trachomatis clinical strain is a recombinant between lymphogranuloma venereum (L(2)) and D lineages.,"UNLABELLED: Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes a diversity of severe and debilitating diseases worldwide. Sporadic and ongoing outbreaks of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) strains among men who have sex with men (MSM) support the need for research on virulence factors associated with these organisms. Previous analyses have been limited to single genes or genomes of laboratory-adapted reference strain L(2)/434 and outbreak strain L(2)b/UCH-1/proctitis. We characterized an unusual LGV strain, termed L(2)c, isolated from an MSM with severe hemorrhagic proctitis. L(2)c developed nonfusing, grape-like inclusions and a cytotoxic phenotype in culture, unlike the LGV strains described to date. Deep genome sequencing revealed that L(2)c was a recombinant of L(2) and D strains with conserved clustered regions of genetic exchange, including a 78-kb region and a partial, yet functional, toxin gene that was lost with prolonged culture. Indels (insertions/deletions) were discovered in an ftsK gene promoter and in the tarp and hctB genes, which encode key proteins involved in replication, inclusion formation, and histone H1-like protein activity, respectively. Analyses suggest that these indels affect gene and/or protein function, supporting the in vitro and disease phenotypes. While recombination has been known to occur for C. trachomatis based on gene sequence analyses, we provide the first whole-genome evidence for recombination between a virulent, invasive LGV strain and a noninvasive common urogenital strain. Given the lack of a genetic system for producing stable C. trachomatis mutants, identifying naturally occurring recombinants can clarify gene function and provide opportunities for discovering avenues for genomic manipulation.
IMPORTANCE: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a prevalent and debilitating sexually transmitted disease in developing countries, although there are significant ongoing outbreaks in Australia, Europe, and the United States among men who have sex with men (MSM). Relatively little is known about LGV virulence factors, and only two LGV genomes have been sequenced to date. We isolated an LGV strain from an MSM with severe hemorrhagic proctitis that was morphologically unique in tissue culture compared with other LGV strains. Bioinformatic and statistical analyses identified the strain as a recombinant of L(2) and D strains with highly conserved clustered regions of genetic exchange. The unique culture morphology and, more importantly, disease phenotype could be traced to the genes involved in recombination. The findings have implications for bacterial species evolution and, in the case of ongoing LGV outbreaks, suggest that recombination is a mechanism for strain emergence that results in significant disease pathology.","['Somboonna N', 'Wan R', 'Ojcius DM', 'Pettengill MA', 'Joseph SJ', 'Chang A', 'Hsu R', 'Read TD', 'Dean D']",2011,2,3,mBio,"Somboonna N, et al.

The aim of this study is to quantify the association between LGV and HIV in the context of the current emergence of LGV.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed on the emergence of LGV among MSM since 2000. We report the prevalence of HIV infection from descriptive studies of MSM with LGV, and conduct a meta-analysis to produce a summary estimate of the association between LGV and HIV from case-control studies where cases were MSM with LGV and controls were MSM with rectal chlamydia caused by non-LGV serovars.
RESULTS: The prevalence of HIV among LGV cases ranges from 67% to 100% in 13 descriptive studies. There is a significant association between HIV and LGV (odds ratio 8.19, 95% CI 4.68-14.33).

21401939,"Anal infections with concomitant Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes among men who have sex with men in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.","BACKGROUND: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) proctitis is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) genotype L and is endemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in western society. Genotype L infections need to be distinguished from non-LGV (genotypes A-K) Ct infections since they require prolonged antibiotic treatment. For this purpose, an in-house developed pmpH based LGV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is used at the Amsterdam STI outpatient clinic. We investigated retrospectively the anal Ct genotype distribution, and the frequency of concomitant genotype infections in MSM infected with LGV and non-LGV Ct infections. To detect concomitant Ct genotype infections, the pmpH LGV PCR and genoTyping Reverse Hybridization Assay (Ct-DT RHA) were used.
METHODS: A total of 201 Ct positive rectal swabs from MSM were selected, which were previously diagnosed as either LGV (n = 99) or non-LGV Ct infection (n = 102) according to the algorithm of Ct detection by the commercially available Aptima Combo 2 assay followed by an in-house pmpH LGV PCR. The samples were retested with the commercially available Ct-DT RHA, which differentiates between 14 major genotypes and is able to detect concomitant Ct genotypes.
RESULTS: Excellent genotyping agreement was observed between the Ct-DT RHA and the pmpH LGV PCR (Kappa = 0.900, 95%CI = 0.845-0.955, McNemar's p = 1.000). A concomitant non-LGV genotype was detected in 6/99 (6.1%) LGV samples. No additional LGV infections were observed with the Ct-DT RHA among the non-LGV Ct group. In the non-LGV group genotype G/Ga (34.3%) was seen most frequent, followed by genotype D/Da (22.5%) and genotype J (13.7%). All LGV infections were caused by genotype L2.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant non-LGV genotypes do not lead to missed LGV proctitis diagnosis. The pmpH LGV PCR displayed excellent agreement with the commercially available Ct-DT genotyping RHA test. The genotypes G/Ga, D/Da and J were the most frequent non-LGV Ct strains in MSM.","['Quint KD', 'Bom RJ', 'Quint WG', 'Bruisten SM', 'van der Loeff MF', 'Morré SA', 'de Vries HJ']",2011,11,,BMC Infect Dis,"Quint KD, et al.

21354663,Genotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis from endocervical specimens of infertile Mexican women.,"INTRODUCTION: It has been reported in several countries that Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes D, E, and F are the ones more frequently associated with urogenital infections. In Mexico, the prevalence of serovars and genotypes is unknown.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two endocervical swabs were collected from infertile women to test for C. trachomatis. The PCR-based RFLP and automated-sequencing methods of ompA gene was used to identify the C. trachomatis genotypes. Sequences of 891 pb obtained were aligned with currently available chlamydial sequences from GenBank to identify the corresponding genotype.
RESULTS: Twenty-four women with infertility (15.8%) were positive for C. trachomatis. According to the RFLP and nucleotide sequences results the most prevalent ompA genotype corresponded to serovar F (n=13 [54.2%]), followed by serovars E (n=2 [8.7%]), G (n=2 [8.7%]), K (n=2 [8.7%]) and LGV (n=2 [8.7%]), while serovars D, H and Ia were less prevalent (all n=1 [4.2%]). None of the patients who were positive to genovar L2 had symptoms of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Nucleotide sequences analysis showed a new genovariant of L2, which was different to L2b to L2f. Mutation points were observed in VS1 domain of Omp A.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study the most common genotypes were F. Furthermore, the L2 genovariants were demonstrated in infertile women without signs and symptoms of LGV disease. Presence of point mutations in L2 genotype sequences were seen by which there is a need for further research in order to identify new L2 genetic variants that exist in Latin America.","['de Jesús De Haro-Cruz M', 'Deleón-Rodriguez I', 'Escobedo-Guerra MR', 'López-Hurtado M', 'Arteaga-Troncoso G', 'Ortiz-Ibarra FJ', 'Guerra-Infante FM']",2011,29,2,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,"de Jesús De Haro-Cruz M, et al.

21347295,Evaluation of a high resolution genotyping method for Chlamydia trachomatis using routine clinical samples.,"BACKGROUND: Genital chlamydia infection is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection in the UK. C. trachomatis genital infections are usually caused by strains which fall into two pathovars: lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and the genitourinary genotypes D-K. Although these genotypes can be discriminated by outer membrane protein gene (ompA) sequencing or multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), neither protocol affords the high-resolution genotyping required for local epidemiology and accurate contact-tracing.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) and ompA sequencing (now called multi-locus VNTR analysis and ompA or ""MLVA-ompA"") to study local epidemiology in Southampton over a period of six months. One hundred and fifty seven endocervical swabs that tested positive for C. trachomatis from both the Southampton genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic and local GP surgeries were tested by COBAS Taqman 48 (Roche) PCR for the presence of C. trachomatis. Samples tested as positive by the commercial NAATs test were genotyped, where possible, by a MLVA-ompA sequencing technique. Attempts were made to isolate C. trachomatis from all 157 samples in cell culture, and 68 (43%) were successfully recovered by repeatable passage in culture. Of the 157 samples, 93 (i.e. 59%) were fully genotyped by MLVA-ompA. Only one mixed infection (E & D) in a single sample was confirmed. There were two distinct D genotypes for the ompA gene. Most frequent ompA genotypes were D, E and F, comprising 20%, 41% and 16% of the type-able samples respectively. Within all genotypes we detected numerous MLVA sub-types.
CONCLUSIONS: Amongst the common genotypes, there are a significant number of defined MLVA sub-types, which may reflect particular background demographics including age group, geography, high-risk sexual behavior, and sexual networks.","['Wang Y', 'Skilton RJ', 'Cutcliffe LT', 'Andrews E', 'Clarke IN', 'Marsh P']",2011,6,2,PLoS One,"Wang Y, et al.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: It is an observational study where we describe a series of cases with LGV diagnosed in the Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol's HIV Unit between March 2008 and April 2009.
RESULTS: All our patients were HIV infected men who had sex with men with proctitis in 80% of the cases.

21315827,HIV-1 does not significantly influence Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 replication in vitro.,"Individuals with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2, are commonly co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), for reasons that remain unknown. One hypothesis is that a biological synergy exists between the two pathogens. We tested this by characterising for the first time in vitro C. trachomatis L2 replication in the presence of HIV-1. The human epithelial cell-line, MAGI P4R5 was infected with C. trachomatis L2 and HIV-1 (MN strain). Co-infected cultures contained fewer and larger chlamydial inclusions, but the inclusions did not contain morphologically aberrant organisms. C. trachomatis remained infectious in the presence of HIV-1 and showed neither an alteration in genome accumulation, nor in the acumulation of ompA, euo or unprocessed 16S rRNA transcripts. However, omcB was slightly elevated. Taken together, these data indicate that HIV-1 co-infection did not significantly alter C. trachomatis replication and the association between HIV-1 and LGV is likely due to other factors that require further investigation. The fewer, larger inclusions observed in co-infected cultures probably result from the fusion of multiple inclusions in HIV-1 induced syncytia and indicate that C. trachomatis-host-cell interactions continue to function, despite considerable host-cell re-modelling.","['Broadbent A', 'Horner P', 'Wills G', 'Ling A', 'Carzaniga R', 'McClure M']",2011,13,6,Microbes Infect,"Broadbent A, et al.

Patients typically present with proctitis symptoms. The prevalence of rectal LGV in MSM attending sexually transmitted infection clinics in London is estimated at 1%. Health Protection Agency surveillance has shown a decrease in anorectal manifestations despite little demographic change. Two cases of HIV-infected patients presenting with isolated perianal ulcer disease are reported here. Both cases were confirmed to have rectal Chlamydia trachomatis-specific DNA of an LGV associated serovar. As presentations of LGV diversify, further education and surveillance are needed in order to reduce transmission and prevent long-term complications. A strong argument already exists for the incorporation of chlamydia nucleic acid amplification tests in the management of MSM with proctitis; this paper provides evidence that this should be extended to MSM with perianal ulcer disease.","['Singhrao T', 'Higham E', 'French P']",2011,87,2,Sex Transm Infect,"Singhrao T, et al.

21114426,Lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis: a differential diagnose to inflammatory bowel disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted disease, endemic in tropical and subtropical areas for many years. After 2003 there have been several outbreaks in western countries, especially among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). An important manifestation of LGV is a proctitis, with a clinical presentation and endoscopic findings resembling those of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). LGV is considered new in Scandinavia. This case report focuses on difficulties in differentiating LGV and IBD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This case report used a systematic search in the literature using PubMed and clinical cases from the Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark (Cases 1-3) and the Section of Surgery, Hamar Hospital, Norway (Case 4).
RESULTS: Clinical and endoscopic findings in LGV and IBD resemble each other. All cases were MSM. Three out of four were HIV-positive. Three out of four contacted their general practitioner (GP) due to gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and were referred to a gastroenterologist (GE) with suspicion of IBD. Because of non-successful IBD treatment, control of HIV status, relapses of GI-symptoms or extended information concerning sexual habits, LGV was suspected and diagnosed. All patients responded with remission of GI-symptoms and endoscopic findings after oral treatment with doxycycline.
CONCLUSION: Due to similarities between LGV and IBD, LGV should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with proctitis or IBD-related symptoms, especially among HIV-positive men. Hence LGV patients may be spared long-lasting examination, mistreatment and surgery.","['Høie S', 'Knudsen LS', 'Gerstoft J']",2011,46,4,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Høie S, et al.

The standard treatment for this infection, which is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis L1, L2 and L3 serotypes, is a 3-week doxycycline regimen. The case is reported of a male patient presenting with LGV, who was rapidly cured with moxifloxacin treatment after failure of extended treatment with cyclines. This fluoroquinolone is known to be highly active in vitro on the LGV pathogenic agent.

20656722,High prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections among HIV-1 negative men who have sex with men in coastal Kenya.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the burden of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in high-risk HIV-1 negative men who have sex with men (MSM) in Africa.
METHODS: Before the start of a pre-exposure prophylaxis trial, HIV-1 negative volunteers were screened for sexually transmitted infection (STI) including CT and NG, using a highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification test. Samples positive for CT by Aptima testing, were evaluated for the presence of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serovars using an in-house PCR assay. All men were asked to submit a urine specimen, and all had a rectal swab collected by a clinician. Men were asked if they had dysuria, urethral or rectal discharge, or rectal pain.
RESULTS: 43 HIV-1 negative MSM were screened, of whom 13 reported sex with men only; the majority (27/43) reported sex work. One volunteer had dysuria and another, rectal pain. Eleven MSM (26%, 95% CI 14% to 41%) had infections with either or both pathogens. Homosexual men had a higher prevalence of any infection than bisexual men (46% vs 17%, p=0.04), and all cases of rectal infections, including one with CT, two with NG and two with CT/NG co-infection. All patients with CT were negative for LGV. One patient with a rectal NG infection reported rectal pain.
CONCLUSIONS: A remarkably high burden of STI infection was found among HIV-1 negative MSM. Most (12/13) infections, including three of four rectal NG infections, were subclinical. These findings suggest that high-risk MSM will benefit from effective STI screening in Kenya.","['Sanders EJ', ""Thiong'o AN"", 'Okuku HS', 'Mwambi J', 'Priddy F', 'Shafi J', 'de Vries H', 'McClelland RS', 'Graham SM']",2010,86,6,Sex Transm Infect,"Sanders EJ, et al.

20625350,Anal lymphogranuloma venereum infection screening with IgA anti-Chlamydia trachomatis-specific major outer membrane protein serology.,"BACKGROUND: Anal lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) infections, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis biovar L (Ct+/LGV+), are endemic among men who have sex with men (MSM). Anal non-LGV biovar Ct infections (Ct+/LGV-) can be eradicated with 1 week doxycycline, whereas Ct+/LGV+ infections require 3-week doxycycline. To differentiate Ct+/LGV+ from Ct+/LGV- infections, biovar-specific Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) are standard, but also expensive and laborious. A chlamydia-specific serological assay could serve as an alternative test.
METHODS: MSM were screened for anal Ct+/LGV+ and Ct+/LGV- infections with a commercial nonspecific NAAT and an in house biovar L-specific NAAT. Serum samples were evaluated with chlamydia-specific anti-Major Outer Membrane Protein (MOMP) and antilipopolysaccharide assays of IgA and IgG classes. Asymptomatic patients were identified as: (1) no anal complaints or (2) no microscopic inflammation (i.e., <10 leucocytes per high power field in anal smears). The best differentiating assay was subsequently evaluated in 100 Ct+/LGV+ and 100 Ct+/LGV- MSM using different cut-off points.
RESULTS: The anti-MOMP IgA assay was the most accurate to differentiate Ct+/LGV+ (n = 42) from Ct+/LGV- (n = 19) with 85.7% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.2-93.3) and 84.2% specificity (95% CI, 62.4-94.5), even among asymptomatic patients. In a population comprising 98 Ct+/LGV+ and 105 Ct+/LGV- patients, the anti-MOMP IgA assay scored most accurate when the cut-off point was set to 2.0 with 75.5% (95% CI, 65.8-83.6) sensitivity and 74.3% (95% CI, 64.8-82.3) specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: The IgA anti-MOMP assay can identify a considerable proportion of the (asymptomatic) anal LGV infections correctly. Yet, biovar L-specific NAAT are still the preferred diagnostic tests in clinical settings.","['de Vries HJ', 'Smelov V', 'Ouburg S', 'Pleijster J', 'Geskus RB', 'Speksnijder AG', 'Fennema JS', 'Morré SA']",2010,37,12,Sex Transm Dis,"de Vries HJ, et al.

20605986,Phylogenetic analysis of Chlamydia trachomatis Tarp and correlation with clinical phenotype.,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and is the most commonly reported pathogen causing sexually transmitted infections. Tarp (translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein), a type III secreted effector that mediates actin nucleation, is central to C. trachomatis infection. The phylogenetic analysis of tarP from reference strains as well as ocular, genital, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) clinical isolates demonstrated an evolutionary relationship with disease phenotype, with LGV and ocular isolates branched into clades that were separate from the urogenital isolates. The sequence analysis of Tarp indicated a high degree of variability and identified trends within clinical groupings. Tarps from LGV strains contained the highest number of tyrosine-rich repeat regions (up to nine) and the fewest (two) predicted actin binding domains. The converse was noted for Tarp proteins from ocular isolates that contained up to four actin binding domains and as few as one tyrosine-rich repeat region. The results suggest that Tarp is among the few known genes to play a role in C. trachomatis adaptations to specific niches within the host.","['Lutter EI', 'Bonner C', 'Holland MJ', 'Suchland RJ', 'Stamm WE', 'Jewett TJ', 'McClarty G', 'Hackstadt T']",2010,78,9,Infect Immun,"Lutter EI, et al.

20509036,Lymphogranuloma venereum proctocolitis: a silent endemic disease in men who have sex with men in industrialised countries.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by serovars L1-L3 of Chlamydia trachomatis. Rare in the western world prior to 2003, different outbreaks or clusters of LGV have been reported in Europe, North America and Australia among men who have sex with men (MSM) over the past few years. The majority were HIV infected MSM with high-risk sexual behaviour and a high rate of concomitant STD, including hepatitis C. Most of them presented with a proctitis syndrome and only a few with the classical bubonic form. A previously non-described serovar, L2b, has been identified as the main causative agent of the epidemic. A delay in diagnosis has been the rule because of the misleading symptomatology of LGV proctitis, the unfamiliarity of the disease to physicians, and the lack of a routine diagnostic test for LGV serovars. It is crucial to increase the awareness of the disease among physicians for prompt diagnosis and treatment, to avoid complications, and to stop ongoing transmission. It has additional public health implications since LGV may facilitate the transmission and acquisition of HIV and other STD.","['Martin-Iguacel R', 'Llibre JM', 'Nielsen H', 'Heras E', 'Matas L', 'Lugo R', 'Clotet B', 'Sirera G']",2010,29,8,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Martin-Iguacel R, et al.

20457248,Comparison of three genotyping methods to identify Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes in positive men and women.,"Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) comprises 3 serogroups and 19 serovars. Different genotyping methods are available to differentiate between the serovars. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and discriminatory power of three genotyping methods, respectively Omp1 sequencing, the Ct Detection and genoTyping (DT) assay and the pmpH real-time PCR discriminating an LGV infection from a non-LGV infection. In total, 50 Aptima Combo 2 (AC2) Ct positive samples were selected and tested with the 3 genotyping methods. The Ct-DT assay detected 3 double Ct infections that caused a non interpretable result by Omp1 sequencing, while Omp1 sequencing has a higher discriminatory power that gave additional information about Ct genovariants. All three methods detected the 6 LGV samples. Although the pmpH real-time PCR detected all LGV infections, a substantial amount (24%) of non-LGV infections were missed. The sensitivity compared to AC2 Ct detection was 80% (95% CI 67-89%) for the Ct-DT assay, 72% (95% CI 58-83%) for Omp1 sequencing and 64% (95% CI 50-76%) for the pmpH real-time PCR. In conclusion, the Ct-DT assay is appropriate for serovar distribution studies, epidemiological studies and differentiation between an LGV and non-LGV Ct infection, while Omp1 sequencing is more appropriate for phylogenetic studies. The pmpH real-time PCR is suitable as second assay to differentiate between an LGV and non-LGV infection, but not as primary detection assay, due to its low sensitivity for non-LGV strains.","['Quint KD', 'Bom RJ', 'Bruisten SM', 'van Doorn LJ', 'Nassir Hajipour N', 'Melchers WJ', 'de Vries HJ', 'Morre SA', 'Quint WG']",2010,24,5,Mol Cell Probes,"Quint KD, et al.

AIMS: To characterize the clinical, endoscopic and histological features seen in men diagnosed initially with IBD and subsequently with LGV proctitis, and to attempt isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis DNA from the stored rectal biopsy specimens of these patients using real-time PCR.
METHODS: Clinical data were collated from confirmed or suspected cases of LGV proctitis where endoscopy and biopsy had been performed as part of the investigation of clinical symptoms. LGV was confirmed by the detection of LGV-specific DNA from rectal swab specimens, with supportive evidence from Chlamydial serology. Stored histological specimens from rectal biopsies were analysed retrospectively for LGV-specific DNA with molecular techniques.
RESULTS: Rectal biopsies had been obtained from twelve cases of LGV proctitis. Mucosal ulcers, cryptitis, crypt abscesses and granulomas were common histological findings. Extraction of LGV-specific DNA from rectal biopsy specimens enabled confirmation of three suspected cases.
CONCLUSIONS: During the recent LGV proctitis epidemic among UK men who have sex with men, it has become apparent that this infection may closely resemble IBD. Gastroenterologists should remain alert to LGV as a cause of proctitis in this group.","['Soni S', 'Srirajaskanthan R', 'Lucas SB', 'Alexander S', 'Wong T', 'White JA']",2010,32,1,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,"Soni S, et al.

Since 2003-2004, a continued outbreak of LGV proctitis (C. trachomatis serovar L2b) has been reported in North America and Europe, including France, among homosexual males, especially with HIV co-infection.
CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old man presented penile ulceration of three weeks' standing, associated with a large swollen granulomatous lesion and an inguinal lymph node but without proctitis. All lesions resolved after a three-week course of doxycycline 200mg daily. These lesions were related to a genital bubo due to LGV as confirmed by positive specific PCR for C. trachomatis (serovar L2) performed on the genital ulceration.
DISCUSSION: Clinical descriptions of male genital LGV are infrequent, even during the LGV proctitis epidemic seen in Western countries in recent years.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After the alarming message from the Netherlands in 2003, physicians in a dermatological and STI private clinic in Zurich started examining rectal swabs from patients with proctitis for LGV serovars of C. trachomatis on a regular basis. A test system based on PCR with sequencing and databank comparison was used. Clinical files of all patients with proctitis observed in this time period were examined.
RESULTS: Since 2003 twelve cases of proctitis, all in MSM, caused by the LGV serovar L2 C. trachomatis were observed. Of the overall 11 patients the majority were HIV positive and only 2 were HIV negative. Only one patient reported previous sexual contacts outside Europe (Thailand) as the likely place of infection. The clinical presentation was characterised by anorectal pain, discharge, tenesmus and change in stool frequency. Four patients were successfully treated with a single dose of 1 g azithromycin. In all seven cases treated with doxycycline 2 x 100 mg for 10-20 days clinical cure and a negative PCR result after treatment were observed, except for one patient lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Zurich has not been spared by the recent outbreaks of LGV proctitis in MSM. Anorectal LGV infections may progress to severe destructive changes, with formation of granulomas, strictures, and perirectal abscesses. Increased awareness of this problem and establishment of reliable diagnostic tools are required.","['Kamarashev J', 'Riess CE', 'Mosimann J', 'Läuchli S']",2010,140,13-14,Swiss Med Wkly,"Kamarashev J, et al.

Consequently, more specific and sensitive detection methods that are rapid and inexpensive are necessary to differentiate between C. trachomatis serovars. The purpose of this study was to identify and differentiate LGV-related C. trachomatis serovars from rectal swabs using high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) and multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR). Fifteen clinical samples from patients in Sydney were first screened and confirmed as C. trachomatis by using the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR analyser. The same samples were assayed for C. trachomatis and LGV by HRMA and MAS-PCR of the polymorphic membrane protein H (pmpH) gene. Both methods indicated that two of 15 samples were serovar L2 and the remainder (13/15) other C. trachomatis serovars. Both HRMA and MAS-PCR are inexpensive, rapid, easy methods that are useful tools for the identification of LGV in clinical and research laboratories.","['Cai L', 'Kong F', 'Toi C', 'van Hal S', 'Gilbert GL']",2010,21,2,Int J STD AIDS,"Cai L, et al.

However, since 2003, with the first cases of LGV proctitis among men who have sex with men reported in the Netherlands, an ongoing epidemic has been revealed in Western society dating back to at least 1981. In this article a case of LGV proctitis is presented, and the state of the art diagnostics, treatment and common complications concerning LGV are discussed. Moreover, risk factors and the background of the recent epidemic of LGV in the Western world among men who have sex with men are summarized. There is a need to develop new diagnostic assays, to prevent complications and to protect the community from more expansive transmission. Shorter antibiotic treatment courses for LGV are necessary but require large controlled clinical trials. The microbial and immunological background of LGV infection in relation to HIV should be studied in detail and could help to explain the considerable number of asymptomatic LGV cases.","['van der Ham R', 'de Vries HJ']",2009,45 Suppl B,,Drugs Today (Barc),"van der Ham R and de Vries HJ.

Is it overlooked?,"Screening for rectal chlamydia was not routinely offered in our department until we had a local outbreak of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in men who have sex with men (MSM) in 2004/2005. We later decided to extend the screening to high-risk women (women who had receptive anal sex, contacts of gonorrhoea, women, with anorectal symptoms, women who had been sexually assaulted). A retrospective study of 152 women from whom 160 rectal chlamydia swabs were taken was carried out. Twenty (12.5%) swabs were positive, 19 of which were also positive at the cervix. All were non-LGV serovars. The groups at greatest risk were high-risk women aged less than 20 years and women with proven gonococcal infection where the prevalence was 22.6% and 30%, respectively. We conclude that rectal chlamydial infection in women may be common and further studies are needed to elucidate its importance.","['Sethupathi M', 'Blackwell A', 'Davies H']",2010,21,2,Int J STD AIDS,"Sethupathi M, et al.

19798844,[Lymphogranuloma venereum: an emerging cause of proctitis in homosexual men in Barcelona].,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a systemic sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L. Since 2003, outbreaks of LGV have been reported in homosexual men in Europe. The objective of this study is to describe an outbreak of LGV in Barcelona in 2007.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Description of a clinical case series of confirmed LGV diagnosed in the STI clinic of Barcelona between September 2007 and January 2008.
RESULTS: Seven cases have been confirmed up to January 31, 2008. All were homosexual men, with a mean age of 36, who were sexually promiscuous. Mean time of symptoms of proctitis was 28 days. All the patients were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for an average period of 5 years.
DISCUSSION: This outbreak is similar to other LGV outbreaks that are occurring in Europe. LGV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of proctitis in homosexual men and be treated with 100 mg of doxycycline/12 hours for three weeks. Preventive interventions directed at HIV infected persons are important.","['Vall-Mayans M', 'Caballero E']",2009,209,2,Rev Clin Esp,Vall-Mayans M and Caballero E.

19221105,The prevalence of lymphogranuloma venereum infection in men who have sex with men: results of a multicentre case finding study.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and non-LGV associated serovars of urethral and rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection in men who have sex with men (MSM).
DESIGN: Multicentre cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: Four genitourinary medicine clinics in the United Kingdom from 2006-7.
SUBJECTS: 4825 urethral and 6778 rectal samples from consecutive MSM attending for sexual health screening.
METHODS: Urethral swabs or urine and rectal swabs were tested for CT using standard nucleic acid amplification tests. Chlamydia-positive specimens were sent to the reference laboratory for serovar determination.
MAIN OUTCOME: Positivity for both LGV and non-LGV associated CT serovars; proportion of cases that were symptomatic.
RESULTS: The positivity (with 95% confidence intervals) in rectal samples was 6.06% (5.51% to 6.66%) for non-LGV CT and 0.90% (0.69% to 1.16%) for LGV; for urethral samples 3.21% (2.74% to 3.76%) for non-LGV CT and 0.04% (0.01% to 0.16%) for LGV. The majority of LGV was symptomatic (95% of rectal, one of two urethral cases); non-LGV chlamydia was mostly symptomatic in the urethra (68%) but not in the rectum (16%).
CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydial infections are common in MSM attending for sexual health screening, and the majority are non-LGV associated serovars. We did not identify a large reservoir of asymptomatic LGV in the rectum or urethra. Testing for chlamydia from the rectum and urethra should be included for MSM requesting a sexual health screen, but serovar-typing is not indicated in the absence of symptoms. We have yet to identify the source of most cases of LGV in the UK.","['Ward H', 'Alexander S', 'Carder C', 'Dean G', 'French P', 'Ivens D', 'Ling C', 'Paul J', 'Tong W', 'White J', 'Ison CA']",2009,85,3,Sex Transm Infect,"Ward H, et al.

Examination revealed large, smooth tender lymph nodes above the inguinal ligament bilaterally with no other areas of lymphadenopathy. Due to a possible diagnosis of LGV, three weeks of doxycycline was given. A further review of the histology slides revealed 'subacute necrotizing lymphadenitis' highly suggestive of Kikuchi-Fujimoto syndrome of unknown cause, which is usually self-limiting.

19176570,Rectal chlamydia--a reservoir of undiagnosed infection in men who have sex with men.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of rectal chlamydia infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM) and the proportion of infection that would be missed without routine screening.
METHODS: MSM presenting to four HIV/GUM outpatient clinics at the Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between 1 November 2005 and 29 September 2006 were offered testing for rectal chlamydia infection in addition to their routine screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) tests were performed using the Beckton-Dickinson Probe-Tec Strand Displacement Assay. Positive samples were re-tested at the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory, to confirm the result and identify lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)-associated serovars.
RESULTS: A total of 3076 men were screened. We found an 8.2% prevalence of infection with CT (LGV and non-LGV serovars) in the rectum and 5.4% in the urethra. The HIV and rectal chlamydia co-infection rate was 38.1%. The majority of rectal infections (69.2%, (171/247)) were asymptomatic and would have been missed if routine screening had not been undertaken. Of the samples re-tested, 94.2% (227/242) rectal and 91.8% (79/86) urethral specimens were confirmed CT positive and 36 cases of LGV were identified.
CONCLUSION: Our data show a high rate of rectal chlamydia infection, in the majority of cases it was asymptomatic. We recommend routine screening for rectal chlamydia in men at risk, as this may represent an important reservoir for the onward transmission of infection.","['Annan NT', 'Sullivan AK', 'Nori A', 'Naydenova P', 'Alexander S', 'McKenna A', 'Azadian B', 'Mandalia S', 'Rossi M', 'Ward H', 'Nwokolo N']",2009,85,3,Sex Transm Infect,"Annan NT, et al.

19125144,Lymphogranuloma venereum in Portugal: unusual events and new variants during 2007.,"BACKGROUND: Several European countries identified an ongoing LGV outbreak, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). In Portugal, no particular surveillance measures were launched. Nonetheless, circulating LGV strains could eventually be detected through the routine Chlamydia trachomatis ompA genotyping procedure held in the Portuguese National Institute of Health (NIH).
METHODS: During 2007, 178 Chlamydia trachomatis specimens were genotyped through amplification and automated-sequencing of ompA. Sequences of 891bp (nt142-nt1032) were aligned with currently available chlamydial sequences from GenBank to identify the corresponding genotype.
RESULTS: Eight Chlamydia trachomatis specimens matched LGV-genotypes (7 ""L2"" and 1 mixed E+L2 undetermined variant). These specimens were identified in samples collected from 4 women and 4 men. One HIV(+) MSM presented LGV related symptoms, while the other infected persons were either asymptomatic or presented no clear LGV symptoms. All samples revealed ompA sequences different from the L2/434 reference strain and from the L2b/144276, which is the most frequently described genotype during the recent LGV outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: The detection of 7 LGV specimens during 2007 in contrast with their absence over the previous 5 years. The LGV infected individuals do not seem to be related to any sexual networks of MSM, contrarily to those described in other European countries. Moreover, all Lisbon LGV specimens revealed unusual ompA sequences that differentiate them from the currently reported LGV infections in Europe. The results of the current study further justify an attentive surveillance of LGV strains infecting different populations and the study of their relation with clinical aspects and disease patterns.","['Gomes JP', 'Nunes A', 'Florindo C', 'Ferreira MA', 'Santo I', 'Azevedo J', 'Borrego MJ']",2009,36,2,Sex Transm Dis,"Gomes JP, et al.

METHODS: Collaborative retrospective case note review. Clinicians from three London genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics accessed by large populations of MSM within the current LGV outbreak collected clinical data from confirmed cases of LGV inguinal syndrome or genital ulcer. LGV was confirmed by the detection of LGV-specific DNA from specimens such as bubo aspirates, ulcer swabs, urethral swabs, first void urine and rectal biopsy material.
RESULTS: There were 13 cases detected overall: 5 cases of urethral LGV infection with inguinal adenopathy, 3 cases of genital ulcer with LGV inguinal adenopathy, 3 cases of isolated LGV-associated inguinal buboes, 1 case of a solitary LGV penile ulcer and 1 case with a penile ulcer and bubonulus. Only 6 of the 13 were HIV positive and all tested negative for hepatitis C. The majority of cases reported few sexual contacts in the 3 months preceding their diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestations of LGV in MSM have not been confined to proctitis in the current outbreak in the UK and a small but significant number of inguinogenital cases of LGV have been observed. Epidemiologically, many of the cases described seem to have occurred at the periphery of the current MSM LGV epidemic.

18833055,Ano-rectal lymphogranuloma venereum: the first case in Italy.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection endemic in Central Africa, South-East Asia and in some countries of Central and South America. In Italy LGV has been sporadically reported in patients coming from abroad. The etiological agent of LGV is Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, L3, differentiating by pathogenetic action. The clinical course of LGV can be divided into three stages with a initial small papule, which may ulcerate, at the site of inoculation, followed by massive lymphadenopathy, which is usually unilateral, and eventually by lymphatic obstruction, causing elephantiasis. During 2004 a LGV ano-rectal clinical variant has been described as an erosive proctitis among homosexual HIV-positive men in some countries of Western Europe, not coming from endemic areas. Until now this syndrome has been often explained as chronic intestinal inflammatory disease. This report describes a case of proctitis caused by CT serovar L2; to Authors' knowledge this is the first case reported in Italy.","['Cusini M', 'Boneschi V', 'Tanzi C', 'Girgenti V', 'De Vries H', 'Alessi E']",2008,143,1,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Cusini M, et al.

27688572,Chlamydia trachomatis Infection and Photosensitive Dermatoses.,"BACKGROUND: Photosensitivity to Chlamydia trachomatis has been described in almost 50% of chronic cases of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) caused by L1, L2 or L3 serovars. Photosensitivity in non LGV strains of C trachomatis has not been studied. We studied the association of various photosensitive dermatoses with C trachomatis infection in non LGV cases.
METHODS: Sera of all the cases of photosensitivity, melasma, chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD), polymorphic light eruption (PLE), actinic prurigo (AP) and rosacea were tested for the presence of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies to C trachomatis by ELISA method. The results were compared with 30 healthy controls.
RESULT: Seventeen (25.53%) of 57 cases of photosensitivity as against two (6.67%) controls were seropositive for IgM/IgG/IgA antibodies, a statistically significant difference (χ(2) 6.18, p 0.013). Similarly, significantly higher seropositivity was observed in 12 (25.53%) of 47 cases of melasma (χ(2) 4.38, p 0.0363) and six (46.15%) of 13 cases with CAD (χ(2) 6.91, p 0.0086). Although higher proportion of patients of rosacea [five (31.25%) of 16 cases] and PLE [four (25.0%) of 16 cases] were seropositive, the difference was not statistically significant (χ(2) 3.23, p >0.05, OR 6.36, CI 95% 0 to 48 and χ(2) 3.09, p 0.078, OR 4.67, CI 95% 5 to 41 respectively). There was no association of AP.
CONCLUSION: The observations suggest that C trachomatis infection in non LGV cases is an important cause of PS, melasma and CAD. It appears to be an important cause of rosacea and PLE. We recommend that all cases of photosensitivity, melasma, CAD, PMLE and rosacea and their spouses/sexual contacts be investigated for C trachomatis infection.","['Sawhney M', 'Arora S', 'Khetrapal A']",2008,64,4,Med J Armed Forces India,"Sawhney M, et al.

18712700,Head and neck manifestations of lymphogranuloma venereum.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)--caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3--rarely occurs in the United States. The disease clinically manifests in three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary manifestation, a self-limited genital ulcer at the site of inoculation, often is absent by the time the patient seeks medical attention. The most common clinical manifestation of LGV is evident in its secondary stage: unilateral tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy. However, proctocolitis or inflammatory involvement of perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues resulting in fistulas and strictures may also occur. The diagnosis of LGV is usually made serologically and by exclusion of other causes of inguinal lymphadenopathy or genital ulcers. Doxycycline is the preferred treatment; it cures the infection and prevents ongoing tissue damage. This case highlights an unusual manifestation of LGV infection--cervical lymphadenopathy following suspected oropharyngeal infection with C trachomatis. Head and neck manifestations of LGV may become an increasing problem in the future if sexual practices such as orogenital contact become more widespread.","['Albay DT', 'Mathisen GE']",2008,87,8,Ear Nose Throat J,Albay DT and Mathisen GE.

18628496,A comparison of two methods for the diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum.,"A recent outbreak of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) within the men who have sex with men (MSM) community and their requirement for extended therapy has highlighted the need for laboratory tests that differentiate LGV- from non-LGV-associated serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis. Two previously described methods were evaluated against 495 clinical specimens referred to the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory (London, UK): (i) PCR amplification of a 1.1 kb region of the ompI gene followed by restriction enzyme digestion (ompI RFLP-PCR); and (ii) real-time PCR targeting a 36 bp deletion present within the polymorphic membrane protein H gene of LGV-associated serovars (pmpH real-time PCR). For specimens that could be categorized using both methods, a 94.7 % (390/412) concordance was achieved. Eighty-three specimens were found to be untypeable by ompI RFLP-PCR due to a failure to amplify the 1.1 kb fragment. Of these 83 untypeable specimens, 19 were determined to be an LGV-associated serovar by pmpH real-time PCR. Despite the high level of concordance, there were differences found in the technical complexity of the two methods. The pmpH real-time PCR exhibited greater sensitivity, a more rapid turnaround time and a lower technical requirement. Whilst the ompI RFLP-PCR was not as robust as a laboratory diagnostic method, it did enable serovar-level identification. LGV infection remains an important threat to the health of high-risk MSM in Europe. In conclusion, the two methods for the detection of LGV from clinical samples were found not only to have a high concordance (94.7 %) but also to be complementary, and could be used in an integrated way to aid LGV detection.","['Alexander S', 'Martin IMC', 'Ison C']",2008,57,Pt 8,J Med Microbiol,"Alexander S, et al.

18445453,Evaluation prompting transition from enhanced to routine surveillance of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in the Netherlands.,"In 2004, a lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) epidemic among men who have sex with men in the Netherlands motivated the introduction of enhanced surveillance. We evaluated the acceptability of the enhanced LGV surveillance in the Netherlands in 2004-2005 to provide recommendations for future surveillance. Completeness of requested patient information was analysed. All 12 sexually transmitted infection (STI) health services participating in the 2004-2005 STI surveillance completed evaluation questionnaires and rated surveillance system features from 1=""very poor"" to 5=""very good"". Information from enhanced LGV surveillance was available for 34 (33%) of 104 cases. For these 34 cases, median proportions of response decreased successively for clinical information (100%), sexual anamnesis (71%) and details about the last sex partners (44%). A median score of 4 (""good"") was assigned to simplicity, required resources and surveillance information requested and distributed. Seven respondents favoured continuation of LGV surveillance, whereof six preferred modifications, usually meaning less extensive surveillance. In conclusion, the enhanced LGV surveillance was generally regarded as adequate. However, it was limited by low completeness, underlining the need to keep requested information to a minimum. The routine STI surveillance now includes LGV diagnosis and, following this evaluation, the additional enhanced surveillance was discontinued. However, occasional cases justify alertness and LGV remains under routine STI surveillance in the Netherlands.","['Kivi M', 'Koedijk FD', 'van der Sande M', 'van de Laar MJ']",2008,13,14,Euro Surveill,"Kivi M, et al.

18363909,Re-emergence of lymphogranuloma venereum.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the L1, L2 and L3 serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis. The disease has been in the spotlight recently because of recent outbreaks in Europe as well as the USA. A unique feature of the recent outbreaks has been that most cases have been caused by the L2 strain. Another unique feature of these outbreaks is the fact that most cases have occurred in men having sex with men, and most patients have presented with proctitis. Interestingly, most recent cases have occurred in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients. Usually, the disease is divided into three phases: the primary stage characterized by a self-healing papule, the secondary stage characterized by proctitis or lymphadenopathy and the tertiary stage characterized by lymphedema and anal strictures. Tests used for diagnosis include polymerase chain reactions and compliment fixation tests. The treatment of choice is doxycycline.",['Kapoor S'],2008,22,4,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Kapoor S.

18307777,Multi locus sequence typing of Chlamydiales: clonal groupings within the obligate intracellular bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis.,"BACKGROUND: The obligate intracellular growing bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis causes diseases like trachoma, urogenital infection and lymphogranuloma venereum with severe morbidity. Several serovars and genotypes have been identified, but these could not be linked to clinical disease or outcome. The related Chlamydophila pneumoniae, of which no subtypes are recognized, causes respiratory infections worldwide. We developed a multi locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme to understand the population genetic structure and diversity of these species and to evaluate the association between genotype and disease.
RESULTS: A collection of 26 strains of C. trachomatis of different serovars and clinical presentation and 18 strains of C. pneumoniae were included in the study. For comparison, sequences of C. abortus, C. psittaci, C. caviae, C. felis, C. pecorum (Chlamydophila), C. muridarum (Chlamydia) and of Candidatus protochlamydia and Simkania negevensis were also included. Sequences of fragments (400 - 500 base pairs) from seven housekeeping genes (enoA, fumC, gatA, gidA, hemN, hlfX, oppA) were analysed. Analysis of allelic profiles by eBurst revealed three non-overlapping clonal complexes among the C. trachomatis strains, while the C. pneumoniae strains formed a single group. An UPGMA tree produced from the allelic profiles resulted in three groups of sequence types. The LGV strains grouped in a single cluster, while the urogenital strains were distributed over two separated groups, one consisted solely of strains with frequent occurring serovars (E, D and F). The distribution of the different serovars over the three groups was not consistent, suggesting exchange of serovar encoding ompA sequences. In one instance, exchange of fumC sequences between strains of different groups was observed. Cluster analyses of concatenated sequences of the Chlamydophila and Chlamydia species together with those of Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila and Simkania negevensis resulted in a tree identical to that obtained with 23S RNA gene sequences.
CONCLUSION: These data show that C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae are highly uniform. The difference in genetic diversity between C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae is in concordance with a later assimilation to the human host of the latter. Our data supports the taxonomy of the order of Chlamydiales.","['Pannekoek Y', 'Morelli G', 'Kusecek B', 'Morré SA', 'Ossewaarde JM', 'Langerak AA', 'van der Ende A']",2008,8,,BMC Microbiol,"Pannekoek Y, et al.

18283094,A real-time quadriplex PCR assay for the diagnosis of rectal lymphogranuloma venereum and non-lymphogranuloma venereum Chlamydia trachomatis infections.,"OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a real-time quadriplex PCR for the diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and non-LGV chlamydial infections using rectal swab specimens.
METHODS: The design of the real-time quadriplex PCR assay incorporates an LGV-specific, a non-LGV-specific target sequence, a Chlamydia trachomatis plasmid target, and the human RNase P gene as an internal control. The performance of the quadriplex PCR was compared with a previously reported real-time duplex PCR assay on which LGV diagnosis was based on exclusion.
RESULTS: Very good agreement (85 of 89 specimens, 95.5%) was found between the two multiplex PCR assays for the detection of C trachomatis DNA (kappa value 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99). Both assays identified 34 LGV, 35 non-LGV C trachomatis and 16 negative specimens. Of two specimens that tested positive for non-LGV by the duplex PCR, one was found to be a mixed infection and the other was positive only for plasmid and RNase P targets by the quadriplex PCR. Two additional specimens that had equivocal results for non-LGV by the duplex PCR also tested positive only for plasmid target and human DNA by the quadriplex PCR. In addition, six specimens that tested negative by the duplex PCR assay were found to be invalid when using the quadriplex PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: A real-time quadriplex PCR assay has been developed that is capable of detecting LGV, non-LGV, or mixed infections simultaneously in rectal specimens. The assay also contains a supplemental amplification target for the confirmation of C trachomatis infection as well as a human DNA control for monitoring sample adequacy and PCR inhibition.","['Chen CY', 'Chi KH', 'Alexander S', 'Ison CA', 'Ballard RC']",2008,84,4,Sex Transm Infect,"Chen CY, et al.

18209688,"New Chlamydia trachomatis L2 strains identified in a recent outbreak of lymphogranuloma venereum in Vienna, Austria.","BACKGROUND: Since 2003, an ongoing outbreak of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by Chlamydia trachomatis biovar L2b, has been reported among men who have sex with men.
METHODS: Twenty-four samples positive for C. trachomatis were analyzed for specific biovars and genovariants by genotyping of the variable segment (VS) 4, VS2 and VS1 regions of the outer membrane protein (omp) A. In addition we assessed the patients' sociodemographic background and clinical signs and symptoms.
RESULTS: Twenty-four men who have sex with men presented with either anorectal or inguinal symptoms and tested positive for C. trachomatis DNA. Of these, the L2 genotype accounted for 15 patients, with a high coinfection rate with HIV (73.3%) and other sexually transmitted infections (53.4%). Analysis of the VS1, VS2, and VS4 regions of the ompA gene revealed the variant L2b in 8 patients. In 4 patients, 3 new L2 sequences were identified with nucleotide changes in the VS1, VS2, and VS4 region, respectively, defining new strains designated L2c, d, e.
CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak of LGV represents the further spread of C. trachomatis L2 infection.

18091565,Lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis in men who have sex with men is associated with anal enema use and high-risk behavior.,"OBJECTIVES: In the industrialized world, lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis (LGVP) has been reported only in men who have sex with men. Factors responsible for the outbreak remain to be elucidated.
GOAL: The goal of the present work was to elucidate risk factors associated with LGVP.
STUDY DESIGN: The study design comprised a cross-sectional study including 32 men with LGVP and 93 men without LGVP (22 with gonorrheal proctitis, 30 with a non-LGV chlamydial proctitis, and 41 with proctitis of unknown etiology). Factors associated with LGVP were analyzed by (multinomial) logistic regression.
RESULTS: Comparing men with LGVP with men without LGVP, factors significantly associated with higher risk of LGVP in multivariate analyses were as follows: anal enema use [odds ratio (OR): 7.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-23.2], having sex on sex parties (OR: 5.7, 95% CI: 1.5-21.8), and having sex with human immunodeficiency virus-positive partners (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.1-9.3). Evaluating the 4 proctitis groups separately in a multinomial logistic regression model, similar associations between anal enema use and LGVP were found. Men with non-LGV chlamydial proctitis showed less risk behavior than men with LGVP. No substantial difference in risk behavior was found, except for attending sex parties, between men with LGVP, and gonorrheal proctitis or proctitis of unknown etiology.
CONCLUSIONS: Apart from men with LGVP, men with gonorrheal proctitis or proctitis of unknown etiology exhibit high risk behavior. Enema use seems to play a key role in transmission of LGVP, and needs further investigation.","['de Vries HJ', 'van der Bij AK', 'Fennema JS', 'Smit C', 'de Wolf F', 'Prins M', 'Coutinho RA', 'Morré SA']",2008,35,2,Sex Transm Dis,"de Vries HJ, et al.

18032721,Chlamydia trachomatis: genome sequence analysis of lymphogranuloma venereum isolates.,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted infections in the UK, a statistic that is also reflected globally. There are three biovariants of C. trachomatis: trachoma (serotypes A-C) and two sexually transmitted pathovars; serotypes D-K and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Trachoma isolates and the sexually transmitted serotypes D-K are noninvasive, whereas the LGV strains are invasive, causing a disseminating infection of the local draining lymph nodes. Genome sequences are available for single isolates from the trachoma (serotype A) and sexually transmitted (serotype D) biotypes. We sequenced two isolates from the remaining biotype, LGV, a long-term laboratory passaged strain and the recent ""epidemic"" LGV isolate-causing proctitis. Although the genome of the LGV strain shows no additional genes that could account for the differences in disease outcome, we found evidence of functional gene loss and identified regions of heightened sequence variation that have previously been shown to be important sites for interstrain recombination. We have used new sequencing technologies to show that the recent clinical LGV isolate causing proctitis is unlikely to be a newly emerged strain but is most probably an old strain with relatively new clinical manifestations.","['Thomson NR', 'Holden MT', 'Carder C', 'Lennard N', 'Lockey SJ', 'Marsh P', 'Skipp P', ""O'Connor CD"", 'Goodhead I', 'Norbertzcak H', 'Harris B', 'Ormond D', 'Rance R', 'Quail MA', 'Parkhill J', 'Stephens RS', 'Clarke IN']",2008,18,1,Genome Res,"Thomson NR, et al.

17591663,Update on lymphogranuloma venereum in the United Kingdom.,"OBJECTIVES: This report updates the UK epidemiology of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) to the end of April 2007.
METHODS: The Health Protection Agency's Centre for Infections undertakes laboratory testing for LGV and subsequent epidemiological investigation of cases after laboratory confirmation of the LGV serovars (L1-3). Data analysis of enhanced surveillance and laboratory reports was undertaken.
RESULTS: From October 2004 to end April 2007, 492 cases of LGV have been diagnosed and enhanced surveillance forms have been returned for 423. Cases peaked in the third quarter of 2005 with an average of 32 cases per month, while in 2006 this fell to 12 cases per month. Nationally, the outbreak is focused in London, Brighton and the North West. All cases are in men, 99% of whom are MSM, with a median age of 40 and predominantly white ethnicity (91%). Co-infection remains considerable: HIV (74%); hepatitis C (14%); syphilis (5%); and other STIs including gonorrhoea, genital herpes and hepatitis B. The number of men reporting greater than 10 sexual contacts in the previous 3 months has reduced from 23% (47) to 13% (15) from 2005-2006.
DISCUSSION: The epidemic continues in the mostly white MSM population of the UK. The demographics of LGV remain similar to those previously described and high levels of HIV co-infection continue. Reduced numbers of sexual contacts might be contributing to the reduced numbers of LGV seen in 2006 but could simply mean that LGV is moving out of the highest risk groups.","['Jebbari H', 'Alexander S', 'Ward H', 'Evans B', 'Solomou M', 'Thornton A', 'Dean G', 'White J', 'French P', 'Ison C', 'UK LGV Incident Group']",2007,83,4,Sex Transm Infect,"Jebbari H, et al.

17567790,Development of real-time PCR assays for genotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis.,"We have developed and validated a nested real-time PCR (NRT-PCR) for the genotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis and used it specifically for the typing of either eight genovars from D to K or three genovars of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). The 11 probes used in the NRT-PCR correctly identified the DNA from D to K and LGV reference strains and did not cross-react with the DNA from 26 strains representing the bacterial pathogens and commensals of the oropharynx, genital tract, and rectum. The NRT-PCR had a 95% probability of detection at four genome copies (confidence interval, three to six copies) of C. trachomatis per reaction. One hundred cervical and urethral swab specimens containing C. trachomatis DNA from 63 women and 37 men were used to validate the method. The results from the NRT-PCR and the DNA sequencing of amplicons generated from the omp1 gene showed 100% correlation for these samples. The assay also identified the LGV-II genotype in 24 of 48 rectal swab specimens containing C. trachomatis DNA that were obtained from men having sex with men. The Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory, London, independently confirmed these results using group-specific LGV real-time PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Compared with the NRT-PCR, non-NRT-PCR was found to be less sensitive: it typed C. trachomatis DNA in only 80% of the genital samples and 90% of the rectal swab samples. This is the first successful demonstration of the use of real-time PCR for the genotype-specific typing of C. trachomatis strains that cause sexually transmitted diseases.","['Jalal H', 'Stephen H', 'Alexander S', 'Carne C', 'Sonnex C']",2007,45,8,J Clin Microbiol,"Jalal H, et al.

17475689,The use of serological titres of IgA and IgG in (early) discrimination between rectal infection with non-lymphogranuloma venereum and lymphogranuloma venereum serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether serological titres of species-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in patients with rectal chlamydial infection could discriminate between infection with serovar L2 lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and infection with non-LGV serovars.
METHODS: A total of 39 male patients with chlamydial infection of the rectum were tested for titres of IgA and IgG antibodies within 14 days after detection of the infection and 6 and 12 months after adequate treatment. Data were collected regarding demographics, sexual orientation, HIV serostatus, history of chlamydial infection, concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI) or HIV infection, hepatitis C virus antibodies and new STIs during follow-up.
RESULTS: Between May 2003 and November 2005, 24 men with confirmed L2 proctitis and 15 men with non-LGV rectal chlamydial infection were recruited. In multivariable analyses, both high titre of IgA within 14 days after detection of the infection and older age of the individual were found significantly associated with L2 proctitis (p<0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). A total sum score of seven times IgA titre and individual's age >or=50 years resulted in an overall sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 100%. This total sum score was highly accurate for detection of LGV proctitis, with an area under the curve in a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.989.

17342667,Treatment of lymphogranuloma venereum.,"BACKGROUND: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) classically presents with 1 or more genital ulcers or papules, as well as inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes). Recently reported cases of LGV proctitis in men who have sex with men, many of whom are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have highlighted the importance of optimal clinical treatment of LGV.
METHODS: A review was conducted of the literature on LGV published between 1998 and 2004, as part of the development of the 2006 sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
RESULTS: Doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily for 21 days) remains the treatment of choice for LGV. No controlled trials support the use of azithromycin or the use of alternative treatment regimens for persons with HIV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the present literature review, the CDC's treatment recommendations for LGV remain unchanged. LGV clinical care, surveillance, and research are severely hindered by the lack of widely available, rapid, standardized tests for the diagnosis of LGV; therefore, patients with symptoms suggestive of LGV, including LGV proctitis, should be presumptively treated with antibacterial therapy for 3 weeks.","['McLean CA', 'Stoner BP', 'Workowski KA']",2007,44 Suppl 3,,Clin Infect Dis,"McLean CA, et al.

Several large clusters of LGV in men who have sex with men have been reported across Europe and in the United States of America (USA) since 2003. LGV is caused by L1, L2 and L3 serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis and is a sexually transmitted infection. LGV causes genital ulcers, infected inguinal lymph nodes (buboes) and proctitis/proctocolitis. Treatment with a three-week course of doxycycline prevents rectal strictures, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation and possibly death. Clinicians seeing men who have sex with men with inguinal lymphadenopathy and bowel symptoms should be aware of this current epidemic.","['Richardson D', 'Goldmeier D']",2007,18,1,Int J STD AIDS,Richardson D and Goldmeier D.

17143811,Lymphogranuloma venereum in the United kingdom.,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 years, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by L serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis, has emerged as a significant problem among men who have sex with men (MSM). We report on, to our knowledge, the largest case series of LGV to date, with detailed epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the epidemic in the United Kingdom.
METHODS: A national diagnostic service and surveillance system was established in October 2004. Cases were confirmed by the presence of C. trachomatis and an LGV serovar (L1, L2, or L3) from genotyping. For confirmed cases, an enhanced surveillance questionnaire was sent to the clinician.
RESULTS: Through February 2006, a total of 327 cases of LGV were confirmed. Cases were diagnosed across the United Kingdom, with the majority from London (71%) and Brighton (13%). Case reports were received for 282 MSM. The majority (96%) had proctitis, many with severe local and systemic symptoms. There was a high level of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (76%), hepatitis C (19%), and other sexually transmitted infections (39%). Nine cases of human immunodeficiency virus infection were diagnosed around the same time as LGV. Most cases were acquired within the United Kingdom, although patients with early cases were more likely to report contacts in The Netherlands.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant burden of this once-rare sexually transmitted infection among MSM in the United Kingdom. LGV may be contributing to the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus infection by facilitating transmission. Further control efforts are required, including awareness campaigns, continued detailed surveillance, and expanded chlamydia testing among MSM.","['Ward H', 'Martin I', 'Macdonald N', 'Alexander S', 'Simms I', 'Fenton K', 'French P', 'Dean G', 'Ison C']",2007,44,1,Clin Infect Dis,"Ward H, et al.

17075436,The molecular diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum: evaluation of a real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction test using rectal and urethral specimens.,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the use of a real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) assay to differentiate between trachoma and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovars of Chlamydia trachomatis and to validate its performance with the conventional genotyping method.
STUDY: Swab specimens from 115 patients with anorectal symptoms or syndromes associated with LGV were tested by a real-time M-PCR assay and the results compared with the PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the major outer membrane protein gene (omp1).
RESULTS: A high agreement of 96.5% (111 of 115 specimens) was found between the real-time M-PCR testing and the standard genotyping method for the detection of C. trachomatis DNA (kappa value, 0.945, P <0.00001). Both methods identified 53 LGV, 32 non-LGV C. trachomatis, and 26 negative specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: The real-time M-PCR assay simultaneously detects and differentiates LGV from non-LGV strains using swab specimens. This assay offers a relatively rapid and sensitive alternative for the diagnosis of LGV infection and is a useful tool for screening and for outbreak investigations.","['Chen CY', 'Chi KH', 'Alexander S', 'Martin IM', 'Liu H', 'Ison CA', 'Ballard RC']",2007,34,7,Sex Transm Dis,"Chen CY, et al.

LGV is not a mandatorily notifiable disease in Germany. Reports of LGV cases have actively been collected by the Robert Koch-Institut since 2004 to describe the outbreak and estimate the extent of the LGV problem in Germany. Updates on the LGV outbreak were published in the German national epidemiological bulletin. Physicians were asked to send their samples to a laboratory for genotyping. A possible case was defined as a person with symptoms of proctitis and/or inguinal lymph node swelling and a positive chlamydia serology. A probable case had in addition a positive chlamydia rectal or urinary PCR test. A case was confirmed if the genotype L1-L3 was identified based on sequence analysis of omp1 gene sequences. Since 2003, LGV has been reported in 78 male patients in Germany. Of these, 61 patients were confirmed as genotype L2. Fifty eight out of 78 patients (74%) are known to be men who have sex with men (MSM). Fifty five patients (71%) had rectal symptoms and 49 (63%) knew they were HIV positive. Sixty two (79%) of the patients were residents of Berlin or Hamburg. LGV has emerged in MSM in Germany at the same time as in other European countries. It is thought that LGV may become endemic in the MSM community in German metropolitan areas, because the number of reported patients with LGV continues to increase. The increase in the number of LGV cases and the high HIV prevalence in LGV patients are of great public health concern.

In order to assess the prevalence of LGV in a high-risk group of MSM and include clinically atypical cases, retrospective analysis of 197 Chlamydia trachomatis-infected men was performed. Sequencing of the ompA gene showed a different serotype distribution compared to recent Swedish studies in heterosexual populations. The most common types were G (45%), D (27%), and J (26%), whereas the normally predominant type E accounted for only 4% of the chlamydia cases. Furthermore, certain ompA genotype variants of the dominant serotypes were highly prevalent among MSM, and the reason for this is discussed. No additional case of LGV was detected by retrospective analysis of the high-risk MSM population. This indicates that, thus far, LGV in Sweden is only a result of sporadic import from infected MSM clusters abroad.","['Klint M', 'Löfdahl M', 'Ek C', 'Airell A', 'Berglund T', 'Herrmann B']",2006,44,11,J Clin Microbiol,"Klint M, et al.

16731669,"Analysis of rectal Chlamydia trachomatis serovar distribution including L2 (lymphogranuloma venereum) at the Erasmus MC STI clinic, Rotterdam.","OBJECTIVES: Compared to urogenital infections, little is known of serovar distribution in rectal chlamydial infection. The aim of this study was to explore possible relations between demographics, sexual behaviour, clinical manifestations, rectal symptoms, and chlamydial serovars including L2 (lymphogranuloma venereum).
METHODS: Genotyping was done prospectively in all rectal chlamydial infections since the outbreak of proctitis caused by lymphogranuloma venereum in February 2003. 33 (15.1%) rectal Chlamydia trachomatis infections from the years 2001 and 2002 were genotyped retrospectively.
RESULTS: Of all 219 rectal chlamydial infections, detected in the period July 2001 to August 2005, a total of 149 (68.0%) were successfully genotyped including 21 (14.1%) infections with serovar L2. In univariable and multivariable analyses, L2 serovar positive patients were significantly more often HIV positive (p = 0.002; OR: 6.5; 95% CI: 2.0 to 21.1), and had had sex in the past 6 months with more partners compared to other serovars. Furthermore, patients with L2 proctitis presented far more often with self reported rectal symptoms (p<0.005; OR: 19.4; 95% CI: 4.9 to 77.0) and clinical manifestations (p<0.005; OR: 15.4; 95% CI: 4.5 to 52.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydial infections with serovar L2 show a different clinical and epidemiological pattern compared to serovar D-K. LGV proctitis is significantly associated with HIV positivity and a high number of sexual partners and causes more rectal symptoms and clinical manifestations. Neither young age nor ethnicity were identified as risk factors for any of the serovars investigated in this study.","['Waalboer R', 'van der Snoek EM', 'van der Meijden WI', 'Mulder PG', 'Ossewaarde JM']",2006,82,3,Sex Transm Infect,"Waalboer R, et al.

16721218,Lymphogranuloma venereum in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals in New York City.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), or chlamydial proctitis, is a classic sexually transmitted disease with prominent gastrointestinal manifestations. The disease has received little attention in recent years, especially in relation to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, outbreaks of LGV have been reported in several large cities in Europe and the United States over the past few years, occurring in both HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals, and the reports have been largely limited to the sexually transmitted disease literature. We recently diagnosed four cases of chlamydial proctitis in HIV-infected individuals, who had different clinical presentations but very similar endoscopic and histopathologic features, as well as prompt and complete response to therapy. It is important for gastroenterologists to recognize that LGV may be reemerging as a relevant clinical entity, because of its similarity to inflammatory bowel diseases and its response to treatment with antibiotics.","['Ahdoot A', 'Kotler DP', 'Suh JS', 'Kutler C', 'Flamholz R']",2006,40,5,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Ahdoot A, et al.

We report here a rapid, sensitive, and specific real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay capable of detecting C. trachomatis and identifying serovar L-2 in the same reaction, directly from rectal swabs. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 25 genome copies for C. trachomatis, and 50 genome copies for L-2. The analytical specificity was 100%, as demonstrated with a diverse range of C. trachomatis serovars and other site-specific bacterial pathogens. With the use of a rapid DNA extraction method, a blinded validation of spiked rectal swabs correctly identified 30 samples containing C. trachomatis cells, L-2 DNA, or negative samples. The multiplexed PCR assay also identified serovar L-2 in 13 of 70 rectal swab samples taken from symptomatic patients. Twelve additional samples were positive for C. trachomatis only, and omp1 sequencing determined these samples as either serovar D, E, G, J, or K.

METHODS: We reviewed 3 cases of LGV proctitis recently diagnosed in Canada.
RESULTS: All 3 cases occurred in men who had sex with men; 2 of the patients had human immunodeficiency virus infection and 1 subsequently seroconverted. A delay in diagnosis occurred in all 3 patients: 2 patients were misdiagnosed initially with inflammatory bowel disease and 1 patient was treated as a case of non-LGV C trachomatis.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the recent outbreak, gastroenterologists in Europe and North America need to be familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of LGV because it mimics inflammatory bowel disease endoscopically and histologically.","['Tinmouth J', 'Rachlis A', 'Wesson T', 'Hsieh E']",2006,4,4,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Tinmouth J, et al.

Further to this alert, a retrospective survey was set up by the Institut de Veille Sanitaire and the reference laboratories for N.gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia in France. Our STI clinic in Paris carried out a clinico-biological retrospective study involving 154 MSM screened for anorectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs) between January 2002 and May 2004 and a prospective study between May 2004 and August 2004. Out of 216 swabs of rectal discharge from homosexual or bisexual males, a total of 32 were positive for C. trachomatis (14.8%) (3 patients in 2002, 11 in 2003 and 18 in 2004). C. trachomatis-positive rectal strains were genotyped to detect the specific C. trachomatis serovars and revealed serovars L(2) for 22 patients (respectively 1 in 2002, 9 in 2003 and 12 in 2004). Serum antibody titers for Chlamydia trachomatis were determined among 14 subjects and revealed strongly positive in 13 cases (1/512 to 1/16384) titers of IgG.

16510000,Genital elephantiasis and sexually transmitted infections - revisited.,"Genital elephantiasis is an important medical problem in the tropics. It usually affects young and productive age group, and is associated with physical disability and extreme mental anguish. The majority of cases are due to filariasis; however, a small but significant proportion of patients develop genital elephantiasis due to bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), mainly lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and donovanosis. STI-related genital elephantiasis should be differentiated from elephantiasis due to other causes, including filariasis, tuberculosis, haematological malignancies, iatrogenic, or dermatological diseases. Laboratory investigations like microscopy of tissue smear and nucleic acid amplification test for donovanosis, and serology and polymerase chain reaction for LGV may help in the diagnosis, but in endemic areas, in the absence of laboratory facilities, diagnosis largely depends on clinical characteristics. The causative agent of LGV, Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L1-L3, is a lymphotropic organism which leads to the development of thrombolymphangitis and perilymphangitis, and lymphadenitis. Long-standing oedema, fibrosis and lymphogranulomatous infiltration result in the final picture of elephantiasis. Elephantiasis in donovanosis is mainly due to constriction of the lymphatics which are trapped in the chronic granulomatous inflammatory response generated by the causative agent, Calymmatobacterium (Klebsiella) granulomatis. The LGV-associated genital elephantiasis should be treated with a prolonged course of doxycycline given orally, while donovanosis should be treated with azithromycin or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination given for a minimum of three weeks. Genital elephantiasis is not completely reversible with medical therapy alone and often needs to be reduced surgically.","['Gupta S', 'Ajith C', 'Kanwar AJ', 'Sehgal VN', 'Kumar B', 'Mete U']",2006,17,3,Int J STD AIDS,"Gupta S, et al.

16355328,Diagnostic and clinical implications of anorectal lymphogranuloma venereum in men who have sex with men: a retrospective case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, outbreaks of anorectal lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) have occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM). This study identifies risk factors and clinical predictors of LGV to determine the implications for clinical practice.
METHODS: The Chlamydia trachomatis serovars for all MSM who had anorectal chlamydia diagnosed at a sexually transmitted infection clinic in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in 2002 and 2003 were retrospectively typed; 87 persons were infected with C. trachomatis serovar L2b and received a diagnosis of LGV. MSM infected with C. trachomatis serovars A-K and who thus had non-LGV anorectal chlamydia (n = 377) and MSM who reported having receptive anorectal intercourse but who did not have anorectal chlamydia (n = 2677) served as 2 separate control groups. Risk factors and clinical predictors were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine clinical relevance.
RESULTS: HIV seropositivity was the strongest risk factor for LGV (odds ratio for patients with LGV vs. those with non-LGV chlamydia, 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 2.6-12.8]; odds ratio for patients with LGV vs. control subjects without chlamydia, 9.3 [95% confidence interval, 4.4-20.0]). Proctoscopic findings and elevated white blood cell counts in anorectal smear specimens were the only clinically relevant predictors for LGV infection (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve, > 0.71). Use of these 2 parameters and HIV infection status provided the highest diagnostic accuracy (for MSM with anorectal chlamydia, the area under the curve was > 0.82; sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 50%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: LGV testing is recommended for MSM with anorectal chlamydia. If routine LGV serovar typing is unavailable, we propose administration of syndromic LGV treatment for MSM with anorectal chlamydia and either proctitis detected by proctoscopic examination, > 10 white blood cells/high-power field detected on an anorectal smear specimen, or HIV seropositivity.","['Van der Bij AK', 'Spaargaren J', 'Morré SA', 'Fennema HS', 'Mindel A', 'Coutinho RA', 'de Vries HJ']",2006,42,2,Clin Infect Dis,"Van der Bij AK, et al.

16352844,Polymorphisms in the nine polymorphic membrane proteins of Chlamydia trachomatis across all serovars: evidence for serovar Da recombination and correlation with tissue tropism.,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular bacterium responsible for ocular, respiratory, and sexually transmitted diseases. The genome contains a nine-member polymorphic membrane protein (Pmp) family unique to members of the order Chlamydiales. Genomic and molecular analyses were performed for the entire pmp gene family for the 18 reference serological variants (serovars) and genovariant Ja to identify specific gene and protein regions that differentiate chlamydial disease groups. The mean genetic distance among all serovars varied from 0.1% for pmpA to 7.0% for pmpF. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serovars were the most closely related for the pmp genes and were also the most divergent, compared to ocular and non-LGV urogenital disease groups. Phylogenetic reconstructions showed that for six of nine pmp genes (not pmpA, pmpD, or pmpE), the serovars clustered based on tissue tropism. The most globally successful serovars, E and F, clustered distantly from the urogenital group for five pmp genes. These pmp genes may confer a biologic advantage that may facilitate infection and transmission for E and F. Surprisingly, serovar Da clustered with the ocular group from pmpE to pmpI, which are located together in the chromosome, providing statistically significant evidence for intergenomic recombination and acquisition of a genetic composition that could hypothetically expand the host cell range of serovar Da. We also identified distinct domains for pmpE, pmpF, and pmpH where substitutions were concentrated and associated with a specific disease group. Thus, our data suggest a possible structural or functional role that may vary among pmp genes in promoting antigenic polymorphisms and/or diverse adhesions-receptors that may be involved in immune evasion and differential tissue tropism.","['Gomes JP', 'Nunes A', 'Bruno WJ', 'Borrego MJ', 'Florindo C', 'Dean D']",2006,188,1,J Bacteriol,"Gomes JP, et al.

15905679,A cluster of acute hepatitis C virus infection among men who have sex with men--results from contact tracing and public health implications.,"OBJECTIVE: An acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in an HIV-positive man who had sex with men (MSM) was notified. In the period of his seroconversion he was also diagnosed with a rectal lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) infection, and was part of a cluster of 15 LGV cases in 2003. Our aim was to investigate HCV transmission and to search for potential spread among sexual contacts and known LGV patients.
METHODS: Our case series included the index, two recent contacts, and 14 LGV cases. They were interviewed about parenteral exposure for HCV, history of sexually transmitted diseases(STDs), sexual behaviour and drug use. Laboratory investigations included anti-HCV antibodies, HCV-polymerase chain reaction, and HCV genotyping.
RESULTS: Seven out of 17 MSM recently seroconverted for HCV (41%). Three genotypes were found. Parenteral risk factors were excluded. Six out of seven had LGV proctitis coinciding with HCV seroconversion, six (86%) were HIV infected. Unprotected anal contact was practised by both HCV uninfected and infected cases. Unprotected active and passive fisting was reported by all seven HCV infected men, compared with two of nine uninfected men (P = 0.003). Non-intravenous drug use during sexual activities was common among all MSM. Numerous, often anonymous, sexual contacts in various European countries were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: A cluster of acute HCV infection is reported among mostly HIV-positive MSM, with multiple partners throughout Europe. Sexual techniques potentially leading to mucosal damage (fisting), concomitant STDs such as LGV and drug use seem facilitating factors for spread. Extensive case finding and partner tracing is advocated as well as targeted prevention messages.","['Götz HM', 'van Doornum G', 'Niesters HG', 'den Hollander JG', 'Thio HB', 'de Zwart O']",2005,19,9,AIDS,"Götz HM, et al.

15876505,[Epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections in France].,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STI) in France are reported on a voluntary basis through several sentinel surveillance systems.
METHODS: To monitor STI, sentinel laboratory- or clinician-based surveillance systems were set up by the Institut de Veille Sanitaire: gonorrhea surveillance (Renago) in 1986, Chlamydia infections surveillance (Renachla) in 1989, and more recently, syphilis surveillance in 2000 and rectal lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in 2004.
RESULTS: From 2000 to 2003, 1,089 syphilis infections were reported. Most of the cases were diagnosed in men having sex with men (MSM) and were mainly reported by STI clinics located in the Paris area. From 1997 to 2000, an increase of gonorrhea was observed each year. After two years of stable trend, the prevalence of gonorrhea increased again in 2003. From 2002 to 2004, 123 LGV cases were diagnosed in France and were observed only in MSM. Since 2001, Chlamydia infections have steadily increased, particularly in women.
COMMENTS: Because STI surveillance is based on a voluntary basis, the number of reported cases is probably lower than the number of STI diagnosed in France. However, the data provided by the different surveillance systems reveals that STI have been increasing in France since 1997. Moreover, the resurgence of syphilis in 2000 and the emergence of rectal LGV in 2004 indicate that these STI occur mainly in MSM. Trends on incidence and patients characteristics observed in France are similar to those of several Europeans countries. European Public Health interventions are becoming necessary to prevent and control STI.","['Herida M', 'Michel A', 'Goulet V', 'Janier M', 'Sednaoui P', 'Dupin N', 'de Barbeyrac B', 'Semaille C']",2005,35,5,Med Mal Infect,"Herida M, et al.

15758234,The plasmids of Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (N16): accurate determination of copy number and the paradoxical effect of plasmid-curing agents.,"A 7.5 kbp cryptic plasmid is found in almost all isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis. Real-time PCR assays, using TaqMan chemistry, were set up to quantify accurately both the chlamydial plasmid and the single copy, chromosomal omcB gene in the infectious, elementary bodies (EBs) of C. trachomatis L1 440. Plasmid copy number was also determined in the EBs of six other lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) isolates (serovars L1-L3), ten trachoma isolates (serovars A-C) and nine urogenital isolates (serovars D-J). The results indicated an average plasmid copy number of 4.0+/-0.8 (mean+/-95 % confidence interval) plasmids per chromosome. During the chlamydial developmental cycle, up to 7.6 plasmids per chromosome were detected, indicating an increased plasmid copy number in the actively replicating reticulate bodies. Attempts to eliminate the plasmid from strain L1 440 using the plasmid-curing agents ethidium bromide, acridine orange or imipramine/novobiocin led to a paradoxical increase in plasmid copy number. It is speculated that the stress induced by chemical curing agents may stimulate the activity of plasmid-encoded replication (Rep) proteins. In contrast to C. trachomatis, only a single isolate of Chlamydophila pneumoniae bears a plasmid. C. pneumoniae strain N16 supports a 7.4 kbp plasmid in which ORF1, encoding one of the putative Rep proteins, is disrupted by a deletion and split into two smaller ORFs. Similar assay techniques revealed 1.3+/-0.2 plasmids per chromosome (mean+/-95 % confidence interval) in EBs of this strain. These findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that the ORF1-encoded protein is involved in, but not essential for, plasmid replication and control of copy number.","['Pickett MA', 'Everson JS', 'Pead PJ', 'Clarke IN']",2005,151,Pt 3,Microbiology (Reading),"Pickett MA, et al.

15636478,[Two HIV-positive men with anorectal lymphogranuloma venereum and hepatitis C: emerging sexually transmitted diseases].,"Two men, aged 41 and 28 years, both known to be HIV-positive, contracted multiple sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) through unprotected anal sexual contact. These included lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) proctitis and hepatitis C. Recently in The Netherlands and Belgium there has been an outbreak of LGV proctitis in HIV-positive men who have sex with men, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2, an STD which up to now has been rare in Europe. Due to information about the epidemic received a few days previously, the LGV proctitis in the second patient could be diagnosed and treated rapidly. The incidence of STDs in men having sex with men is increasing, also in HIV-positive men. STDs with ulcerative lesions, such as LGV, facilitate transmission of other pathogenic micro-organisms, including HIV. This, in combination with high-risk sexual behaviour such as unprotected anal sexual intercourse, will increase the chance of blood-blood contact and hence the chance of contracting multiple STDs concurrently. Hepatitis C is not normally considered as an STD, but ulcerative lesions in one of the partners combined with high-risk sexual behaviour enables the hepatitis C virus to be sexually transmitted.","['van Agtmael MA', 'Perenboom RM']",2004,148,51,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,van Agtmael MA and Perenboom RM.

Unlike other cases where there was anorectal involvement, this patient was the first case of LGV with the classical inguinal presentation although he had not visited the tropics where the inguinal form of LGV occurs as an STD. Routine investigation using PCR on material from urethra and rectum and from the urine, repeatedly failed to detect LGV. However, PCR on pus aspirated from the enlarged lymph node demonstrated Chlamydia trachomatis serovar type L2. Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily was started. This case illustrates that routine analysis from urethra and rectum and of urine may fail to detect LGV. Furthermore, this case of a patient who probably had LGV initially in the urethra may be the missing link in explaining the route of transmission of the anorectal LGV epidemic.","['Wolkerstorfer A', 'de Vries HJ', 'Spaargaren J', 'Fennema JS', 'van Leent EJ']",2004,148,51,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Wolkerstorfer A, et al.

15488733,"Cell death, BAX activation, and HMGB1 release during infection with Chlamydia.","Infection by a number of Chlamydia species leads to resistance of the host cell to apoptosis, followed by induction of host-cell death. In a population of infected cells that displays protection against staurosporine-induced apoptosis among the adherent cells, we find that cells that had been recovered from the supernatant share characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis, as assayed by the propidium iodide (PI)-annexin V double-labeling technique. Cell death was observed in both an epithelial cell line and primary fibroblasts, although the primary cells had a higher propensity to die through apoptosis than the immortalized cell line. Staurosporine-mediated activation of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, BAX, was inhibited in the epithelial cell line infected for 32 h with the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV/L2) but not the murine pneumonitis (MoPn) strain of C. trachomatis, but inhibition of staurosporine-mediated BAX activation disappeared after 48 h of infection with the LGV/L2 strain. Conversely, infection with MoPn (C. muridarum) but not LGV/L2 led to BAX activation after 72 h, as previously reported for shorter (48 h) infection with the guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis (GPIC) serovar of C. psittaci (C. caviae). These results suggest that the ability to inhibit staurosporine-mediated BAX activation or to activate BAX due to the infection itself may vary as a function of the chlamydial strain. Interestingly, both the epithelial cells and the fibroblasts also released high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) during infection, although much less HMGB1 was released from fibroblasts, consistent with the higher level of apoptosis observed in the primary cells. HMGB1 is released preferentially by necrotic or permeabilized viable cells, but not apoptotic cells. In the extracellular space, HMGB1 promotes inflammation through interaction with specific cell-surface receptors. Higher levels of HMGB1 were also measured in the genital-tract secretions of mice infected vaginally with C. trachomatis, compared to uninfected controls. These results suggest that cells infected with Chlamydia release intracellular factors that may contribute to the inflammatory response observed in vivo.","['Jungas T', 'Verbeke P', 'Darville T', 'Ojcius DM']",2004,6,13,Microbes Infect,"Jungas T, et al.

15472852,Resurgence of lymphogranuloma venereum in Western Europe: an outbreak of Chlamydia trachomatis serovar l2 proctitis in The Netherlands among men who have sex with men.,"BACKGROUND: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and is rare in the Western world. Recently, 3 men who have sex with men presented with LGV proctitis at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. We investigated a possible outbreak in a sexual network of men who have sex with men (MSM).
METHODS: After active case finding, a total of 15 men presented and were investigated. Serum antibody titers to Chlamydia trachomatis were determined. Urine and rectum specimens were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of C. trachomatis. C. trachomatis-positive specimens were genotyped to detect the specific C. trachomatis serovars. All subjects underwent routine STD screening. Sociodemographic, clinical, and endoscopic characteristics were evaluated.
RESULTS: Thirteen subjects had high immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA titers to C. trachomatis, suggesting an invasive infection. Rectal specimens of 12 subjects were PCR-positive for C. trachomatis. All urine specimens were negative. Genotyping revealed serovars L(2) (n=8) and L(1) (n=1). An ulcerative proctitis was found in all subjects obtaining sigmoidoscopy (n=9). Eleven of 13 subjects with an LGV diagnosis were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 6 had another concomitant STD, and 1 had recently acquired a hepatitis C virus infection. Further sexual contacts were reported from The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and France.
CONCLUSIONS: We revealed an outbreak of LGV proctitis among MSM in The Netherlands. The ulcerous character favors transmission of HIV, other STDs, and blood-borne diseases. From a public health perspective, it seems important to increase the awareness of possible LGV in MSM with symptomatic proctitis.","['Nieuwenhuis RF', 'Ossewaarde JM', 'Götz HM', 'Dees J', 'Thio HB', 'Thomeer MG', 'den Hollander JC', 'Neumann MH', 'van der Meijden WI']",2004,39,7,Clin Infect Dis,"Nieuwenhuis RF, et al.

12595433,Polymorphic membrane protein H has evolved in parallel with the three disease-causing groups of Chlamydia trachomatis.,"Chlamydia trachomatis is a human pathogen causing trachoma, urogenital disease, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). A family of nine polymorphic membrane protein genes (pmpA to pmpI), resembling autotransporter proteins, has recently been discovered in C. trachomatis. pmp genes are large and predicted to be outer membrane proteins. We hypothesized that they would contain useful nucleotide sequence variability for epidemiologic studies. Since sequence information is available only for serovars D and L2, we sought to determine the amount of diversity within an individual pmp gene among serovars. We used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis as a primary screen to assess the amount of sequence divergence among the pmp genes for serovars A to L3 of C. trachomatis. RFLP analysis showed little variation for some of the genes, such as pmpA, but substantial variation in others, such as pmpI. pmpH and pmpE yielded RFLP patterns that clustered the 15 serovars into ocular, urogenital, and LGV groups, and both proteins have been localized to the outer membrane. Therefore, we chose to sequence pmpE, pmpH, and pmpI from each of the 15 serovars. Evolutionary analysis showed three distinct divergence patterns. PmpI was least variable, resulting in an ambiguous evolutionary pattern. PmpE showed a high degree of diversity in the ocular strains compared to the other strains. Finally, the evolution of PmpH shows three groups that reflect disease groups, suggesting this protein may play a role in pathogenesis.","['Stothard DR', 'Toth GA', 'Batteiger BE']",2003,71,3,Infect Immun,"Stothard DR, et al.

12181466,Coexistence of urethritis with genital ulcer disease in South Africa: influence on provision of syndromic management.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether syndromic management of genital ulcer disease was sound, if based on the premise that men with genital ulcers rarely have a concomitant urethral infection.
METHODS: Specimens were taken in 1998 from 186 mine workers in Carletonville, South Africa, who were seen consecutively with genital ulcers. The specimens comprised a swab from the ulcer, a urethral swab for a Gram stained smear, and 10-15 ml of a first catch urine sample. The latter was tested by ligase chain reaction assays for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis specific DNA sequences and by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Mycoplasma genitalium. Ulcer inducing micro-organisms were detected either by a multiplex PCR assay, or in the case of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serologically, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was detected by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test.
RESULTS: Most (54%) of the ulcers were chancroidal, 18% were herpetic (HSV type 2), 6.5% primary syphilitic, and 3.2% due to LGV. More than one micro-organism was detected in 9.1% of the ulcers and less than 10% were undiagnosed. Microscopic examination of the urethral smears showed that 99 (53%) of the men had urethritis, of whom 45 (45%) were infected with N gonorrhoeae. Of the 54 men (55%) who had non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), 11 (19.6%) harboured C trachomatis or M genitalium. Almost two thirds (64.5%) of the men had HIV infection, but this did not seem to have influenced the aetiology of the ulcers. Nor was a particular ulcer associated with one type of urethritis more than the other. Neither C trachomatis nor M genitalium was associated significantly with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in either HIV positive or HIV negative men.
CONCLUSION: The combination of antibiotics used for the management of genital ulcer disease in men in this South African mining population needs to be widened to encompass frequently occurring concomitant gonococcal urethritis and NGU infections.

11984440,Epidemic Lymphogranuloma venereum during epidemics of crack cocaine use and HIV infection in the Bahamas.,"BACKGROUND: Since the early 1980s, the Bahamas has experienced sequential epidemics of freebase/crack cocaine use, genital ulcer-inguinal adenopathy disease (GUD), and heterosexual HIV infection.
GOAL: To prospectively define the etiology of GUD in patients at the Princess Margaret Hospital during outbreaks of crack cocaine use, GUD, and HIV infection in the Bahamas.
STUDY DESIGN: In Nassau, 47 consecutive patients with GUD underwent serologic testing for syphilis and for infections with HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and Chlamydia trachomatis. Genital ulcer specimens were tested by culture and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Haemophilus ducreyi; by PCR and/or antigen assay for HSV; and by PCR for C trachomatis. Lymph node aspirates were tested by PCR for C trachomatis and H ducreyi.
RESULTS: Twenty patients (43%) had HIV infection; eight had lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), confirmed by PCR detection of C trachomatis sequences consistent with the L2 serovar; and nine others had possible LGV, on the basis of serum microimmunofluorescent C trachomatis antibody titers > or =256. Inguinal lymphadenopathy or bubo was present in 15 of 17 patients, who thus met the laboratory criteria for definite or possible LGV, and in 7 of 30 who did not meet such laboratory criteria (P < 0.001). Thirteen patients had confirmed genital herpes, seven had confirmed chancroid, and four had probable or possible primary syphilis.
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemics in the Bahamas of crack use, heterosexual HIV infection, and GUD apparently included epidemic transmission of LGV.","['Bauwens JE', 'Orlander H', 'Gomez MP', 'Lampe M', 'Morse S', 'Stamm WE', 'Cone R', 'Ashley R', 'Swenson P', 'Holmes KK']",2002,29,5,Sex Transm Dis,"Bauwens JE, et al.

11748163,Role of Bcl-2 family members in caspase-independent apoptosis during Chlamydia infection.,"Infection with an obligate intracellular bacterium, the Chlamydia trachomatis lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV/L2) strain or the guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis serovar of Chlamydia psittaci, leads to apoptosis of host cells. The apoptosis is not affected by a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, and caspase-3 is not activated in infected cells, suggesting that apoptosis mediated by these two strains of Chlamydia is independent of known caspases. Overexpression of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bax, was previously shown to induce caspase-independent apoptosis, and we find that Bax is activated and translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondria in C. psittaci-infected cells. C. psittaci-induced apoptosis is inhibited in host cells overexpressing Bax inhibitor-1 and is inhibited through overexpression of Bcl-2, which blocks both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis. As Bax and mitochondria are ideally located to sense stress-related metabolic changes emanating from the interior of an infected cell, it is likely that Bax-dependent apoptosis may also be observed in cells infected with other intracellular pathogens.","['Perfettini JL', 'Reed JC', 'Israël N', 'Martinou JC', 'Dautry-Varsat A', 'Ojcius DM']",2002,70,1,Infect Immun,"Perfettini JL, et al.

A clonal mutant cell line, D4.1-3, refractory to infection by the C. trachomatis L2 serovar was isolated. The D4.1-3 cell line appears to be lacking in a previously undescribed temperature-dependent and heparin-resistant binding step that occurs subsequent to engagement of cell surface heparan sulfate by L2 elementary bodies.

9690326,[Lymphogranuloma venereum].,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) or Nicolas-Favre disease is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) which occurs throughout Africa and mostly affects men. The true prevalence of LGV in tropical countries is not known. The most prominent clinical signs of LGV are inguinal and rectal syndrome, with the inguinal syndrome being the most frequent sign in men. Inguinal adenitis is mostly unilateral. The glands are at first hard and tender but soon become matted together. Fistulae may develop within the glands in swollen areas, some of which break through the reddish-purple overlying skin in chronic cases. The groin fold often separates the glands into upper and lower groups. The rectal syndrome is not common in African patients. It is the second most common sign of LGV, but is not specific to this STD. Fluctuant, discharging, painful and often unilateral adenitis with or without a history of primary ulcerative lesion is most likely to be confused with cat-scratch fever, pyrogenic infections, tuberculosis, adenitis caused by syphilis, mycetoma and histoplasmosis. The diagnosis of LGV should be confirmed by culture, which can be used to isolate the L strain of Chlamydia trachomatis or by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The histological features of adenitis and rectal lesions are not specific. Tetracycline antibiotics are the most effective treatment for LGV.","['Pitche P', 'Plinga A', 'Tchangaï-Walla K']",1998,8,3,Sante,"Pitche P, et al. [Lymphogranuloma venereum].

C. trachomatis (lymphogranuloma venereum [LGV])-elicited immune murine spleen cells lysed target cells infected with other C. trachomatis serovars, although with lower sensitivity than they lysed LGV-infected target cells. Additionally, target cells infected with C. psittaci were lysed by C. trachomatis-elicited immune spleen cells. Notably, C. psittaci-infected cells were lysed with greater efficiency than were cells infected with the C. trachomatis strain used to elicit the immune spleen cells. The lysis of C. psittaci-infected cells was characterized further and could be only partially accounted for by CD8+ T-cell-mediated lysis, the remaining lysis being due to an antigen-nonspecific component. These results indicate that mechanisms of immunologically mediated lysis differ between C. trachomatis- and C. psittaci-infected cells. This has important implications for the interpretation of results obtained with C. psittaci models of infection and immune resolution, particularly as they may be extrapolated to C. trachomatis.","['Beatty PR', 'Rasmussen SJ', 'Stephens RS']",1997,65,3,Infect Immun,"Beatty PR, et al.

9032759,Chlamydia trachomatis glycosaminoglycan-dependent and independent attachment to eukaryotic cells.,"Chlamydia trachomatis consists of two biovars, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and trachoma, that differ in their infectivity in vivo and in vitro. Although addition of exogenous heparin or heparan sulfate in vitro effectively inhibits infectivity of both biovars and inhibits LGV biovar attachment to host cells, trachoma biovar attachment was only modestly inhibited (approximately 30%) by exogenous heparin. To dissect the relationship of heparin inhibition of attachment and infectivity, a heparan sulfate lyase (heparitinase) was used to treat organisms and evaluated for changes in attachment and infectivity. In contrast to heparitinase-treated LGV biovar organisms that lose their ability to attach and infect, treatment of trachoma biovar organisms with a concentration of heparitinase sufficient to reduce trachoma biovar infectivity by > 90%, only inhibited attachment to host cells by approximately 40%. Significantly, attachment could be fully restored for heparitinase-treated organisms of both biovars with exogenous heparan sulfate; however, the coating of the trachoma biovar organisms with heparan sulfate rendered the trachoma biovar similar to the phenotype of the LGV biovar by > 90% sensitivity to heparin inhibition of attachment. These data suggest that the LGV biovar used predominantly a heparin-inhibitable mechanism for attaching to host cells, whereas the trachoma biovar used a heparin-independent means in addition to a heparin-dependent mechanism to adhere to host cells. Once attached, the trachoma biovar, nevertheless, relied on the heparin-dependent pathway to enter host cells.","['Chen JC', 'Stephens RS']",1997,22,1,Microb Pathog,Chen JC and Stephens RS.

RESULTS: The accuracy of a clinical diagnosis was, in men: lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) 66%, donovanosis 63%, chancroid 42%, genital herpes 39%, primary syphilis 32%, mixed infections 8%, and in women; secondary syphilis 94%, donovanosis 83%, genital herpes 60%, primary syphilis 58%, chancroid 57%, LGV 40%, mixed infections 14%. Overall, diagnostic efficiency was greater in women than in men. When compared with other causes of GUD, donovanosis ulcers bled to the touch and were larger and not usually associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy. In women, extensive vulval condylomata lata were readily differentiated from all other causes of GUD.
CONCLUSION: A clinical diagnosis in genital ulceration was less accurate in men than in women. The diagnostic accuracies for donovanosis and secondary syphilis were relatively high but for most other conditions were low. Differences between clinical and laboratory diagnostic accuracies may reflect similarities between the clinical appearances of the various causes of GUD, the presence of mixed infections, atypical ulceration due to longstanding disease, and insensitive laboratory tests. In this community all large ulcers should be treated empirically for syphilis and donovanosis. Uncircumcised men with GUD are an important HIV core or ""superspreader"" group locally, and prevention strategies should include counselling and health education in the light of the inaccuracy of clinical diagnosis found in this study. The development of rapid accurate tests for GUD is urgently required.","[""O'Farrell N"", 'Hoosen AA', 'Coetzee KD', 'van den Ende J']",1994,70,1,Genitourin Med,"O'Farrell N, et al.

8152374,Trachoma and LGV biovars of Chlamydia trachomatis share the same glycosaminoglycan-dependent mechanism for infection of eukaryotic cells.,"A sulphated glycosaminoglycan-dependent mechanism of microbial infection for mammalian cells was characterized for the Chlamydia trachomatis trachoma and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovars. We demonstrated that the trachoma and LGV biovars compete for the same receptor(s) on host cells and that their infectivity was inhibited by heparin or heparan sulphate. Using a specific heparan sulphate lyase (heparitinase) to treat organisms, the infectivity of both biovars was abolished. Furthermore, exogenous heparan sulphate rescued chlamydial infectivity following treatment with heparitinase and the restored infectivity was neutralized by an anti-heparan sulphate monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that heparan sulphate-like-mediated interactions between C. trachomatis and eukaryotic cells are essential for infectivity.","['Chen JC', 'Stephens RS']",1994,11,3,Mol Microbiol,Chen JC and Stephens RS.

In this paper the entire chlamydia Mip-like sequence of C. trachomatis serovar L2 (lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovar) is presented. The sequence shows high similarity to the legionella Mip protein and its C-terminal region, like that of the legionella Mip, has high amino acid similarity to eukaryotic and prokaryotic FK506-binding proteins. The chlamydial mip-like gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in other C. trachomatis serovars and by sequencing of the mip-like genes of serovars B and E (trachoma biovar) was shown to be highly conserved within the two major biovars of C. trachomatis. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant Mip-like protein failed to demonstrate surface-exposed epitopes on infectious elementary bodies or reproductive reticulate body forms either by immunofluorescence or immuno-gold electron microscopy. However, a complement-dependent inhibition of up to 91% of infectivity for cell cultures was observed with antibodies to the N-terminal fragment of the Mip-like protein suggesting that antibody-accessible epitopes are present on infectious EBs.","['Lundemose AG', 'Rouch DA', 'Birkelund S', 'Christiansen G', 'Pearce JH']",1992,6,17,Mol Microbiol,"Lundemose AG, et al.

DESIGN: Microbiological and clinical assessment of genital ulcers in men.
SETTING: City Health sexually transmitted diseases clinic, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa.
PARTICIPANTS: 100 Zulu men with genital ulcers who had not received antibiotics in the previous four weeks.
RESULTS: Syphilis was diagnosed in 42%, chancroid in 22%, donovanosis (granuloma inguinale) in 11%, genital herpes in 10% and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in 6%. No pathogens were identified in 24%. Mixed infections were detected in 14 men, in whom 13 had syphilis. Five men had HIV-1 antibodies. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from the ulcers and urethra in seven men and from the urethra alone in five. Scabies was diagnosed clinically in eight.
CONCLUSIONS: All the major causes of GUD are prevalent in Zulu men in Durban. Primary syphilis was the commonest and was invariably present in mixed infections. Donovanosis was under-reported and was associated with a long delay before presentation. In this population, genital ulcers other than superficial lesions should be treated with anti-syphilitic therapy and oral antibiotics effective against chancroid and donovanosis.","[""O'Farrell N"", 'Hoosen AA', 'Coetzee KD', 'van den Ende J']",1991,67,4,Genitourin Med,"O'Farrell N, et al.

2175951,Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of genital ulcer disease.,"In Africa, establishment of an accurate clinical diagnosis in cases of genital ulcer disease is difficult owing to atypical presentation of ulcerations and mixed infections. This is compounded by the frequent lack of suitable laboratory facilities. In 240 cases of genital ulcer disease among mineworkers in Carletonville, South Africa, this study endeavored to correlate the clinical diagnosis with laboratory findings. Clinical accuracy and positive and negative predictive values were determined for each type of genital ulcer disease encountered. Overall, the accuracy of clinical diagnosis was 68% for single infections, 80% for chancroid, 55% for primary syphilis, 27% for lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and 22% for genital herpes. Adequate laboratory facilities are indispensible for the establishment of an accurate etiologic diagnosis of genital ulcer disease and thus the institution of appropriate antimicrobial therapy.","['Dangor Y', 'Ballard RC', 'da L Exposto F', 'Fehler G', 'Miller SD', 'Koornhof HJ']",1990,17,4,Sex Transm Dis,"Dangor Y, et al.

These 58,000 (outer membrane protein 2; OMP2) and 15,000 (OMP3) proteins also differ structurally and chemically between biovariants that differ in invasive capability. We have identified the gene for OMP3 and sequenced both trachoma and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) omp3 genes. We have previously sequenced omp2 from the LGV biovar and now describe the omp2 sequence for a trachoma biovariant. Amino acid sequence differences between biovariants were few but, significantly, these changes have altered the charge of both OMP2 and OMP3 such that the net charge of each protein differs between biovariants. These compensatory charge alterations have implications for the outer membrane organization of these proteins. In addition, examination of the OMP3 sequence suggests that OMP3 may be a lipoprotein.","['Allen JE', 'Cerrone MC', 'Beatty PR', 'Stephens RS']",1990,4,9,Mol Microbiol,"Allen JE, et al.

Twenty-five sought care because of inguinal adenopathy (with spontaneous draining fistulae in two patients) and two because of proctitis. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from nine patients; all isolates were the LGV biovar as demonstrated by biologic characterization and monoclonal antibody reactivity. In patients without isolation of C. trachomatis, the diagnosis was based on chlamydial complement fixation antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:32 (mean titer, 1:128).

2614396,Ultrastructural studies on the intracellular fate of Chlamydia psittaci (strain guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis) and Chlamydia trachomatis (strain lymphogranuloma venereum 434): modulation of intracellular events and relationship with endocytic mechanism.,"Previous observations on the highly infectious LGV strain 434 of Chlamydia trachomatis and the guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis (GPIC) strain of C. psittaci (which requires centrifugation of inocula with host cell monolayers for maximum infectivity) indicated that infectivity differences were expressed, not at entry, but at an intracellular stage affecting multiplication. Centrifugation increased the potential of internalized chlamydiae to undergo productive infection. Here, analysis of the intracellular fate of chlamydiae by ultrastructural methods indicates that strain GPIC exhibits two patterns of behaviour depending on the mode of inoculation. Strain GPIC showed limited entry, with 47% of intracellular organisms becoming associated with thorotrast-labelled lysosomes, following static incubation with monolayers. In contrast, with centrifugation, entry was not limited and association with lysosomes was reduced to 12%; strain 434 behaved similarly but independently of the mode of inoculation. The different results for strain GPIC correlated with distinct entry mechanisms. Entry during static incubation was unimpaired either by treatment with cytochalasin D or by temperature reduction to 20 degrees C, suggesting that it was pinocytic. Entry during centrifugation was markedly impaired by both treatments, suggesting that it was phagocytic. The data lead to two novel conclusions: first, that chlamydiae can apparently enter cells by both pinocytic and phagocytic mechanisms; second, that the entry mechanism influences intracellular fate. It is suggested that entry mechanism is linked to selection of the vesicle membrane forming around the internalizing chlamydiae. This, in turn, may influence both intracellular translocation and subsequent inhibition or promotion of multiplication of the internalized parasite.","['Prain CJ', 'Pearce JH']",1989,135,7,J Gen Microbiol,Prain CJ and Pearce JH.

2666020,Inhibition of Chlamydia trachomatis growth in endometrial cells by copper: possible relevance for the use of the copper IUD.,"There is agreement that the relative risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) increases among women who use the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD). The role of Chlamydia in causing PID among IUD users is not clear. The present study demonstrates that Chlamydia trachomatis growth can be inhibited in cultured human endometrial cells by copper ions at concentrations known to be released by the copper IUDs. More than 98% inhibition was produced with 10(-5) and 10(-6) M of copper. Both C. trachomatis serovar E and a lymphogranuloma venereum Chlamydia serovar L2 (LGV) were inhibited by the copper ions. Although the mechanism of the inhibition is not known, the continuous presence of the copper ions during and after adherence appeared to be necessary for maximal effect. If such inhibition occurs in vivo, it is possible that copper ions released from the copper-containing IUD may partially protect against chlamydial infection.","['Kleinman D', 'Sarov I', 'Insler V']",1989,39,6,Contraception,"Kleinman D, et al.

There was no apparent effect of CsA treatment on the gross or microscopic appearance of LGV proctitis, but CsA-treated animals, with or without LGV infection, had lymphoid hyperplasia of spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. CsA treatment inhibited the primary antibody response to LGV, inhibited peripheral blood lymphocyte mitogen-induced proliferation and IL-2 production, and inhibited LGV-specific proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. In contrast, mitogen-stimulated proliferation of spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and lamina propria lymphocytes was not significantly inhibited in CsA-treated animals. In addition, LGV-specific proliferation of spleen and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes was not inhibited. High mitogen-stimulated IL-2 production of lamina propria lymphocytes was only partially inhibited in CsA-treated animals. In vitro CsA treatment had the expected inhibitory effects on mitogen- and antigen-induced proliferation of spleen and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes.

Neither tunicamycin nor neuraminidase treatment of HeLa cells impaired binding to C. trachomatis EB, implying that host cell N-linked carbohydrate domains and sialic acid moieties, respectively, are not involved in attachment. However, trypsinized HeLa cells do not bind to EB, suggestive of a proteinaceous host cell receptor. The trypsin sensitivity of two EB-specific binding proteins Mr = 18,000 and 31,000) was also examined, and the finding that 125I-labeled HeLa cells bind both the 18,000 and 31,000-dalton proteins after chlamydial trypsinization corroborates our earlier observation that these EB binding proteins mediate attachment.","['Kaul R', 'Chong KL', 'Wenman WM']",1989,48,1,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Kaul R, et al.

Both T and B cells proliferated in response to stimulation with LGV, but B-cell proliferation was T-cell-dependent, as shown by cell separation techniques and cell-cycle analysis with dual-laser flow cytometry. Lymphocytes isolated from both involved and uninvolved lamina propria did not proliferate in response to LGV stimulation, whereas mitogen-induced proliferation was not different in lamina propria lymphocytes and the other lymphocyte populations. This lack of antigen-specific proliferation was not caused by a suppressor effect of mucosal T cells or monocytes or the absence of antigen-presenting cells. In contrast, lamina propria T lymphocytes from infected animals were able to provide antigen-specific help for polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis by immune B lymphocytes after stimulation with LGV. Thus, in LGV proctitis in monkeys, mucosal antigen-reactive T cells differ from lymphocytes in other sites in that they can provide helper function, but are not able to proliferate in response to LGV antigens.","['Zeitz M', 'Quinn TC', 'Graeff AS', 'James SP']",1988,94,2,Gastroenterology,"Zeitz M, et al.

3112229,Differential antimicrobial activity of human mononuclear phagocytes against the human biovars of Chlamydia trachomatis.,"The antimicrobial activities of human mononuclear phagocytes against Chlamydia trachomatis were investigated. Phagocytes cultured for 7 days or less were efficiently microbicidal. Almost complete inactivation of organisms from both human biovars was observed after 48 hr of incubation. However, organisms from the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovar survived in mononuclear phagocytes infected after 8 days or more in culture, whereas those from the trachoma biovar continued to be killed by such cells. Phagocytes cultured as long as 21 days killed the trachoma organisms with the same effectiveness as those cultured for 7 days or less. An ultrastructural study of inoculated phagocytes illustrated phagolysosomal fusion with degradation of organisms from either biovar in phagocytes which had been cultured for 24 hr before infection. Phagolysosomal fusion was not observed in cells which had been cultured for 8 days or more and then infected with LGV. The addition of interferon-gamma to these macrophages partially restored the phagocytes' microbicidal activity for LGV. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was observed when eosinophil peroxidase was added with interferon. Specific antibody failed to neutralize the infectivity of LGV organisms in 8-day or older mononuclear phagocytes. The findings may reflect the differences in disease syndromes between the two biovars, with the trachoma biovar causing more peripheral diseases and the LGV biovar causing a more systemic disease, with lymph node involvement as its main syndrome.","['Yong EC', 'Chi EY', 'Kuo CC']",1987,139,4,J Immunol,"Yong EC, et al.

2952593,Cytotoxic and immunoregulatory function of intestinal lymphocytes in Chlamydia trachomatis proctitis of nonhuman primates.,"To study the role of natural killer cells and immunoregulatory T cells in the pathogenesis of proctitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis (L2 serovar), lymphocytes were obtained from the rectal mucosa and other sites of nonhuman primates and studied by using phenotypic and functional assays. In animals with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) proctitis, the percentage of lymphocytes with the natural killer cell phenotype (Leu-11+) was not significantly higher at any site in LGV infection, and natural killer cell function of lymphocytes isolated from the rectum was lower during LGV infection. This was not due to the suppressive effect of factors in serum, rectal lymphocytes, or LGV elementary bodies. In studies of regulatory T cells, the Leu-3+/Leu-2+ ratio was lower in the peripheral blood and the spleen during LGV infection, but the ratio did not decrease in lamina propria T cells. Both peripheral blood and rectal lymphocytes had higher helper T-cell function for polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cultures 2 weeks following LGV infection. Increased suppressor T-cell function for pokeweed mitogen-stimulated IgG synthesis was found only in the peripheral blood of animals 2 weeks after infection, but not in isolated rectal lymphocytes. These results indicate that in LGV proctitis natural killer cells are not an important component of the inflammatory infiltrate at the site of infection, and helper T-cell function increases in peripheral blood and rectal lymphocytes.","['James SP', 'Graeff AS', 'Zeitz M', 'Kappus E', 'Quinn TC']",1987,55,5,Infect Immun,"James SP, et al.

After inoculation, C. trachomatis was isolated from rectal cultures in three of five non-LGV-infected monkeys and in all five LGV-infected monkeys for a period of 10 weeks. LGV-infected monkeys developed a severe hemorrhagic ulcerative proctitis, in contrast to a mild proctitis in the non-LGV-infected monkeys. Hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles and a mucosal polymorphonuclear leukocyte and mononuclear cell infiltrate were evident in all infected monkeys. Crypt abscesses with giant cells and a rare granuloma formation were present in two of five LGV-infected monkeys. C. trachomatis inclusions were initially present in epithelial cells and later in tissue histiocytes.

2433383,Antigenic specificity of human antibody to chlamydia in trachoma and lymphogranuloma venereum.,"An understanding of the molecular basis of the humoral immune response to chlamydial infections in man requires the identification of target antigens to which antibodies are directed. The antigenic specificity of antibody from patients with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) or trachoma was therefore assessed by Western blotting. Surface polypeptides were first identified using purified chlamydial outer membrane complex as antigen. Antibodies in sera from patients with LGV but not from control negative sera reacted with a wide range of chlamydial surface polypeptides with molecular masses of 19, 29, 41, 58, 63 and 65 kDa. The major component of the antibody response detected by both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation assay was directed against the major outer membrane protein (MOMP). Antibody to MOMP was species-specific on Western blotting, whereas antibody to several other polypeptides recognized common immunodeterminants on polypeptides of C. psittaci Cal-10 of equivalent molecular mass. Immunologically C. psittaci Cal-10 was more closely related to LGV strains of C. trachomatis than a guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis strain of C. psittaci. Trachoma sera collected from a village in southern Iran showed predominantly type-specific antibody on micro-immunofluorescence to serotype A or B trachoma agents. These sera showed a weak immune response to MOMP, a pronounced response to a polypeptide of 36 kDa and much less widespread reactivity with other chlamydial polypeptides. The lack of an immune response to SDS-stable immunodeterminants on MOMP might contribute to the susceptibility of trachoma patients to repeated cycles of ocular infection with chlamydiae.","['Ward ME', 'Treharne JD', 'Murray A']",1986,132,6,J Gen Microbiol,"Ward ME, et al.

4055030,Differences in outer membrane proteins of the lymphogranuloma venereum and trachoma biovars of Chlamydia trachomatis.,"The lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and trachoma biovars of Chlamydia trachomatis exhibit differences in biological properties both in vivo and in vitro. To identify analogous biochemical differences, we studied the molecular charges of chlamydial outer membrane proteins (OMPs) by means of isoelectric focusing and nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis. Analysis of proteins of whole elementary bodies biosynthetically labeled with L-[35S]cysteine revealed that most chlamydial proteins were neutral or acidic. The major OMPs (MOMPs) of all strains tested were acidic and had apparent isoelectric points (pIs) that varied within narrow limits (approximately 5.3 to 5.5) despite differences in molecular mass of up to 3,000 daltons (Da). However, a low-molecular-mass cysteine-rich OMP analogous to that previously described for Chlamydia psittaci varied consistently in molecular mass (12,500 versus 12,000 Da) and pI (5.4 versus 6.9) between LGV strains and trachoma strains, respectively. OMPs with a molecular mass of 60,000 Da in the trachoma biovar strains had pIs in the 7.3 to 7.7 range. However, analogous OMPs in the LGV strains existed as a doublet with a molecular mass of about 60,000 Da. Both members of the doublet were basic (pIs greater than 8.5). Both proteins of this basic doublet in LGV strains and the neutral analog in trachoma strains bound a species-specific monoclonal antibody in an immunoblot assay. These data indicate substantial differences in biochemical characteristics of analogous OMPs in the LGV and trachoma biovars. Such differences are the first structural differences described between LGV and trachoma strains which support their distinction into separate biovars and may be related to some of their biological differences.","['Batteiger BE', 'Newhall WJ', 'Jones RB']",1985,50,2,Infect Immun,"Batteiger BE, et al.

4045232,Immunotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis with monoclonal antibodies.,"Rapid and precise immunotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis was achieved by testing whole organisms (elementary bodies) in the microimmunofluorescence test with monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies were produced with standard techniques by using an immunization schedule that encouraged the development of immunotype-specific antibodies. Fifteen monotypic or multitypic (subspecies) monoclonal antibodies were chosen for use in a two-step typing system that required strains of C. trachomatis to be tested against six to eight monoclonal antibodies for classification. Immunotyping with monoclonal antibodies was studied by testing 313 strains, typed with the previous method that utilized immunized mouse antisera, that represented each of the 15 established serovars. The two-step monoclonal antibody method resulted in a classification similar to the current one. Only one strain typed differently with the two methods. With the monoclonal antibody method, available lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serovars L1 and L3 could not be differentiated from trachoma serovars E and G, respectively, unless the strains had been identified as LGV. Monoclonal antibody typing was simpler to perform and more precise; it allowed easy differentiation between closely related serovars. Three new types were discovered among the strains previously classified as serovars D, I, and L2. These are tentatively being considered subtypes and are labeled D', I', and L2'.","['Wang SP', 'Kuo CC', 'Barnes RC', 'Stephens RS', 'Grayston JT']",1985,152,4,J Infect Dis,"Wang SP, et al.

4043951,Follicular proctocolitis and neuromatous hyperplasia with lymphogranuloma venereum.,"Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a sexually transmitted disease, is caused by certain immunotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis. Proctitis due to LGV may be histologically indistinguishable from Crohn's disease of the rectum, thereby creating a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. The pathologic features found at autopsy at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 28 patients in whom LGV had been diagnosed clinically were reviewed, with the clinical features, to determine whether any of those features could be used to distinguish between LGV and Crohn's colitis. The results showed that although many of the pathologic findings in the intestines of subjects with LGV were similar to those observed in patients with Crohn's disease, the distribution of lesions in the colons of subjects with LGV was distinctly different from that observed in patients with Crohn's colitis. With LGV, the salient histopathologic lesions consisted of follicular lymphohistiocytic-plasma cell infiltrates in the submucosa, muscularis propria, and serosa; neuromatous hyperplasia in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses; and extensive thickening and fibrosis of the bowel wall. The rectum was uniformly involved by these processes and, in addition, had deep ulceration and fissuring, while more proximal segments of the colon were generally spared of severe chronic inflammation. Thus, the colonic lesions of LGV have a distal left-sided predominance, in contrast to the usual right-sided predominance with rectal sparing in Crohn's colitis.","['de la Monte SM', 'Hutchins GM']",1985,16,10,Hum Pathol,de la Monte SM and Hutchins GM.

The pathological features of this infection resemble those of human LGV infection since both are characterized by granuloma formation. Mice developed resistance to reinfection with LGV, and this resistance was based on cellular immune mechanisms since it was transferable with immune spleen cells but not with immune serum. Resistance required viable organisms for induction. We compared LGV biovar infection with trachoma biovar infection. Trachoma biovar produced similar but less marked microbiological and pathological features. Cross-immunity was less apparent between serovars from trachoma and LGV biovars than it was between serovars within the same biovar.

The complement fixation test for chlamydial antibody is broadly reactive, but possesses low sensitivity, whereas the microimmunofluorescence test is highly sensitive, but technically difficult to perform. A simple, rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for the measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to C. trachomatis. Wells of microtiter plates were coated with Renografin-purified elementary bodies (serotype L2) grown in cycloheximide-treated McCoy cells, and serum antibody was detected with peroxidase-labeled goat antihuman IgG and IgM antibody. Of 41 sera tested from patients with lymphogranuloma venereum, pelvic inflammatory disease, cervicitis, or urethritis there was a 90 and 63% correlation of positive results for IgG and IgM, respectively, by microimmunofluorescence and ELISA. Of the positive correlates, ELISA titers were up to 128 times higher than microimmunofluorescence titers for IgG and IgM. The ELISA detected no false-positive results, but missed two positive results for IgG. Both of these sera were reactive against serotypes C and J, suggesting that the ELISA with LGV L2 antigen may not measure antibodies to serotypes within the C serogroup. The IgM ELISA detected 7 negative and 4 positive results not detected by the microimmunofluorescence test. Of four paired sera examined by ELISA, three showed a fourfold rise in IgG antibody titer, and one showed a twofold rise.

The RIA test gave compatible results with the standard microimmunofluorescence test, and by RIA it was possible to identify the infecting serotype in 30 out of 36 patients studied. In 28 cases this was L2 and in two cases L1. Each patient had IgG antibodies and most of them (80%) IgA antibodies to at least one of the LGV serotypes. The antibody titers were still high 40 years after the acute infection, being higher than in male patients with a recent chlamydial urethritis. Highest antibody titers were detected in LGV patients who had a severe disease with intestinal involvement.","['Meurman O', 'Terho P', 'Sonck CE']",1982,170,4,Med Microbiol Immunol,"Meurman O, et al.

6958011,Epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases in the Scandinavian countries.,"In the Scandinavian countries, laws require reporting of the traditional venereal diseases, i.e., gonorrhea, syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and ulcus molle, or chancroid. Incidence figures for these diseases, therefore, are fairly reliable. In the Scandinavian countries, LGV and chancroid are rare diseases, and the syphilis incidence has remained low. These three diseases are typically male afflictions. Gonorrhea outnumbers the other diseases mentioned and at present has a nearly 1:1 male: female ratio. In Scandinavia, as in other parts of the world after World War II, gonorrhea has shown great epidemiological fluctuations. A heavy increase in its incidence was evident in Sweden and Denmark during the 1960s. During the 1970s, however, the incidence in Sweden dropped significantly, with the 1980 figures corresponding to those seen in 1960. Sweden now has the lowest incidence of gonorrhea among the Scandinavian countries. During the past three years, the incidence of infections with penicillinase-producing gonococci (PPNG) has increased. Most of the strains isolated have originated from the Far East. As documented in several recent investigations, genital chlamydial infections are at least as common as gonorrhea in the Scandinavian countries. Acute salpingitis has been shown to be a common complication of such infections. Among the other sexually transmitted diseases (STD), Trichomonas infections are still common. The prevalence of genital warts and of Herpes Simplex Virus (type 2) infections is increasing and within the next few years these probably can be expected to become an even greater problem than are the traditional venereal diseases, because no specific treatment is yet available.","['Hansson H', 'Danielsson D']",1982,32,,Scand J Infect Dis Suppl,Hansson H and Danielsson D.

6958006,Biology of Chlamydia.,"The genus Chlamydia consists of two species, Chlamydia trachomatis and C. psittaci. The former includes (a) the trachoma/inclusion conjunctivitis (TRIC) agents, subdivided into the serotypes A-K; (b) the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) agents, subdivided into the serogroups (L 1-3); and (c) the mouse penumonitis agent. The major characteristics differentiating the two species are sulfonamide susceptibility and the formation of distinct inclusion granula in host cells, in the case of C. trachomatis, whereas C. psittaci is resistant to sulfonamides and forms less dense inclusions. Chlamydiae are characterized by a special growth cycle. The infective form of Chlamydia is the elementary body (EB), which stimulates its own phagocytosis by the host cell, an event followed by the EB's transformation into the reticulate body (RB). The RB forms small buds which subdivide by simple fission to produce several RB within the host cell cytoplasm. The growth cycle is completed by transformation of the RB into the infective EB from before liberation of the latter from the host cell. The chlamydiae are deficient in independent energy metabolism. Thus, their supply of ATP and essential building blocks must be obtained from the host cell cytoplasm. The TRIC agents have neuraminidase localized to the surface structures. Receptors of the microbe are temperature-sensitive, whereas the host cell is trypsin-sensitive.",['Bergan T'],1982,32,,Scand J Infect Dis Suppl,Bergan T. Biology of Chlamydia.

The clinical manifestations of LGV include extragenital infections such as pharyngitis, with cervical lymphadenopathy, and proctitis. Delayed diagnosis can lead to late complications, with disabling anatomic defects as an end result. Diagnosis usually is based on clinical grounds, with serological confirmation. Other chlamydial infections besides LGV can cause seroconversion, particularly in tests for complement-fixation antibodies.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) was isolated from the anal canal or rectum in 15 of the 52 (29 percent) men and characteristically caused severe anorectal pain and focal ulcerations visible on sigmoidoscopy. Despite negative initial Gram stains, seven men (14 percent) had anorectal gonococcal infection. Six (12 percent) had syphilis, including two with dark-field positive anal lesions. Four were infected with enteric pathogens, including Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica or Campylobacter fetus ssp. jejuni. Chlamydia trachomatis (LGV 2 strain) was isolated from one patient with severe granulomatous proctitis. One or more etiologic pathogens were identified in 28 (67 percent) of 42 men who had anorectal leukocytic exudate and in two of 10 who did not (p = 0.01).

C. trachomatis was isolated from the rectums of 14 men. Three of the isolates, which had lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) immunotypes, were recovered from three men with symptoms and signs of severe proctitis, two of whom had granulomatous inflammation that was observed at rectal biopsy and was initially suggestive of Crohn's disease. Eleven isolates, which had non-LGV immunotypes, were obtained from eight symptomatic and three asymptomatic men, all of whom had fecal leukocytes and mild abnormalities of the mucosa present at sigmoidoscopy, usually with mild nongranulomatous inflammatory changes that were seen on rectal biopsy. These observations suggest that the presence of LGV immunotypes of C. trachomatis in the rectum is associated with severe acute proctitis that mimics Crohn's disease of the rectum, whereas the non-LGV immunotypes are associated with a mild proctitis with or without symptoms.","['Quinn TC', 'Goodell SE', 'Mkrtichian E', 'Schuffler MD', 'Wang SP', 'Stamm WE', 'Holmes KK']",1981,305,4,N Engl J Med,"Quinn TC, et al.

Host lipid synthesis was reduced approximately 90% when cells were incubated for 24 h in medium containing cycloheximide (2 micrograms/ml). Lipid metabolism was monitored by measuring the incorporation of [3H]isoleucine into the total lipid of normal and infected cells. The results suggested that lipid synthesis of Chlamydia trachomatis lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV-404L) was not inhibited by cycloheximide treatment when the chlamydiae were grown in L cells, whereas host lipid synthesis was inhibited. Chlamydial lipid metabolism began about 6 to 12 h after infection when the noninfectious reticulate body was found and continually increased until the beginning of the appearance of intracellular infectious elementary bodies at 24 to 30 h.","['Reed SI', 'Anderson LE', 'Jenkin HM']",1981,31,2,Infect Immun,"Reed SI, et al.

All 18 men met standard serologic criteria for the diagnosis of LGV (complement-fixing antibody titer, greater than 1:16; microimmunofluorescent IgG antibody titer, greater than 1:1,000). However, four of the six chlamydial isolates were non-LGV strains of C. trachomatis.

The growth cycle of LGV in both host cells was similar; however, a greater number of infectious organism developed intracellularly and were released into the medium during LGV infection of HeLa 229 cells than MK-2 cells. A rapid infection accompanied by a high rate of glycogen synthesis and a short period of accumulation was found in GeLa 229 cells infected with LGV. LGV infected MK-2 cells started to accumulate glycogen about the same time as HeLa 229 cells; however, the rate of glycogen synthesis was lower and the period of accumulation was longer. The LGV agent grew in cycloheximide-treated cells in the absence of host cell protein synthesis. Protein synthesis associated with LGV throughout the developmental cycle was similar in both cell types and could be abolished by chloramphenicol. The continued synthesis of glycogen in the presence of cycloheximide suggested that the synthesis of glycogen was directed by the organism in both MK-2 cells and HeLa 229 cells.","['Weigent DA', 'Jenkin HM']",1978,20,3,Infect Immun,Weigent DA and Jenkin HM.

Both strains grew to a limited extent in the macrophages, but lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) grew better than trachoma. Growth was enhanced by centrifugation of the inoculum onto the macrophage cell layer and inhibited by pretreatment of macrophages for 2 h with 100 mug of concanavalin A per ml.

97940,Sero-epidemiological study of Lymphogranuloma venereum in Western Nigeria.,"A sero epidemiological study involving 5009 individuals resident in the two largest cities (Ibadan and Benin) in the Western Region of Nigeria has been carried out, using the LGVCFT to determine the presence of LGV antibodies. These individuals come from various population groups and social classes (i.e. blood donors, antenatal clinic patients, general out-patients, venereal diseases clinic patients and prostitutes). Among the 3638 subjects tested in Ibadan, the seroreactivity rates ranged from 5.3% to 11.5%, while of the 1371 in Benin, the seroreactivity ranged from 7.3% to 18.3%. The seroreactivity rates confirm previous suspicion that there is a considerable reservoir of infection among the female population both in normal women and in prostitutes. While the value of LGVCFT as an epidemiological tool in the estimation of latent or active infection in a community has been substantiated, a puzzling variation in the endemicity of the LGV agent, even within the same region, has been observed.

326816,Modification of the microimmunofluorescence test to provide a routine serodiagnostic test for chlamydial infection.,"A modification of the microimmunofluorescence test to provide a practicable routine serodiagnostic test for detecting and characterising chlamydial infection is described which uses four antigen pools, one of which corresponds with each of the four main clinical and epidemiological types of chlamydial infection. The three subgroup A Chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis) pools are: pool 1, hyperendemic trachoma TRIC agent serotypes A, B, and C; pool 2, paratrachoma TRIC agent serotypes D, E, F, G, H, I, and K; pool 3, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) agent serotypes L1, L2, and L3. Pool 4 contained four representative isolates of subgroup B Chlamydia (Chlamydia psittaci). For routine purposes sera need be screened only against these four representative antigen pools. This will detect antibody and indicate which clinical and epidemiological type of chlamydial infection is implicated, thereby clearly distinguishing those infections that are due to C. psittaci. The pattern of the cross-reactions may indicate the individual serotype involved, and further titration requiring a maximum of four individual antigens is sufficient to determine the serotype. The slight loss in sensitivity (twofold) is more than compensated for by the reduction in cost and the tenfold increase in the total number of sera which can be examined.","['Treharne JD', 'Darougar S', 'Jones BR']",1977,30,6,J Clin Pathol,"Treharne JD, et al.

There is general agreement that LGV has a predilection for lymphatic channels and lymph nodes. However, very little is known of the extent of lymph node involvement in the early bubonic stage and whether there is merely a lymphangitis or complete lymphatic obstruction. The present study was undertaken to determine the lymphographic appearance in acute bubonic LGV, the extent of lymphatic node involvement in early LGV, and the usefulness of the procedure in the management of LGV patients. The buboes were not outlined by this procedure. The vessel phase of the lymphogram appeared normal, while the nodal phase showed a gradient of pathological involvement from the inguinal region lessening towards the lumbar nodes. The main drawbacks of lymphography in LGV are the difficulty of visualizing the lymphatics in the negroid skin and the lack of diagnostic criteria for inflammatory diseases of the lymphatic system. The lymphographic findings in LGV as described here may be regarded as typical of LGV but cannot be accepted as specific for LGV with a high degree of confidence. It is suggested that the procedure could be used for monitoring patients with the severe and late sequelae of LGV infection.","['Osoba AO', 'Beetlestone CA']",1976,52,6,Br J Vener Dis,Osoba AO and Beetlestone CA.

963615,Differences in physicochemical and antigenic properties of chlamydial strains.,"Antigenic analysis of Chlamydia psittaci, C. trachomatis, and Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) revealed basic physicochemical differences among the three chlamydial strains. These were manifested in structural, isoelectric points, absorption spectra, and in the characteristics of the chromophobe-containing proteins. The effective period of sonication for C. psittaci and C. trachomatis is around 60 min during which the linkages most susceptible to external sonication forces were broken, releasing all attainable cellular components. Denaturation studies demonstrated that less than 50% of protein content of C. psittaci was denatured after 1 h of sonication, only 5% in the case of C. trachomatis. The protein and carbohydrate content of the most reactive fractions in macrophage-spreading inhibition test were different for LGV and C. trachomatis. The structural differences appear to determine the antigenic properties observed among the chlamydial strains as well as the specificity and probably the mechanisms (s) of cellular immune reactivity to Chlamydiae. This in turn may explain the failure of chlamydial vaccines, prepared from stock strains, to protect immunized children against 'wild' chlamydial strains.","['Sayed H', 'Fung K', 'Wilt JC']",1976,22,7,Can J Microbiol,"Sayed H, et al.

Factors affecting attachment and inclusion formation and correlation of the two are presented. It was shown that attachment is an important initial step in infection by Chlamydia trachomatis. The rate of attachment was temperature dependent. The attachment of LGV organisms was affected more profoundly by temperature than was that of trachoma organisms. Attachment and inclusion formation of trachoma and LGV organisms were inhibited by heparin. Diethylaminoethyl-dextran was again shown to enhance attachment and inclusion formation of trachoma but not LGV organisms. NaF had no effect on attachment, but inhibited inclusion formation of both trachoma and LGV organisms. Both attachment and inclusion formation of trachoma organisms were strongly enhanced by centrifugation of the inoculum onto the cell monolayer. Although inclusion formation of trachoma organism was much greater in susceptible cells (HeLa 229) than relatively insusceptible cells (fetal tonsil), attachment was only slightly greater. The results based on the test of two cell lines suggested that attachment prpbably is not a critical factor in determing a cell line's susceptibility to infection with trachoma organisms.","['Kuo CC', 'Grayston T']",1976,13,4,Infect Immun,Kuo CC and Grayston T.

Serial LGV complement fixation tests, the most valuable diagnostic tool, may reveal many more cases than reported previously. Early treatment is important. We recommend therapy for all persons sexually exposed to LGV who have any LGV complement fixation test anomaly, whether or not clinical signs develop.","['McLelland BA', 'Anderson PC']",1976,235,1,JAMA,McLelland BA and Anderson PC.

802791,[Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Biological diagnosis].,"In his thesis inspired on Favre's works, Phylactos (in 1922) synthetized the knowledges prevailing then on the disease which was characterized in 1913 by Durand, Nicolas, and Favre. He distinguished this disease from tuberculosis, Hodgkin's disease, pestis, syphilis, and chancroid, thus establishing the basic elements of the clinical diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum. In 1924, Gamma described the intracellular inclusions, thus giving rise to the biological diagnosis. In 1925, Frei proved that the heated pus filtrate obtained from buboes induced a specific intradermal reaction. In 1927, Gay Prieto described the elementary corpuscles.","['Svarch Scharager NN', 'Hernández Hernández OJ']",1976,28,1,Rev Cubana Med Trop,Svarch Scharager NN and Hernández Hernández OJ.

51883,Antigenic analysis of Chlamydiae by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis. II. A trachoma-LGV-specific antigen.,"Two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis was utilized to study precipitins in hyperimmune rabbit serum made against chlamydiae and from patients with chlamydial infections. An antigen of Triton X-100-solubilized L2/434/Bu organisms with an electrophoretic mobility of 0.65 relative to bovine serum albumin at pH 8.6 was excised from the agarose gel of electrophorograms as antigen-antibody complexes and used to immunize rabbits. A monospecific antiserum to antigen 0.65 was obtained that reacted with Trachoma-LGV strains L2/434/Bu, B/TW-5/OT, and K/UW-31/Cx, but not with the mouse pneumonitis (Nigg) strain or the psittacosis strain meningopneumonitis (Cal-10). The Trachoma-LGV specificity of antigen 0.65 was further shown by indirect immunofluorescence straining with the monospecific antiserum of chlamydial inclusions in infected HeLa cells. Precipitins with a specificity for antigen 0.65 were indentified in 15 of 18 sera from patients with diagnosed Chlamydia trachomatis infections LGV, trachoma, nongonococcal urethritis, and nongonococcal cervicitis by using monospecific antiserum to antigen 0.65 in the peak suppression test. Thus, antigen 0.65 appears to be a Trachoma-LGV-specific antigen that has considerable promise for serodiagnosis.","['Caldwell HD', 'Kuo CC', 'Kenny GE']",1975,115,4,J Immunol,"Caldwell HD, et al.

1097546,New knowledge of chlamydiae and the diseases they cause.,"The trachoma and LGV organisms, the human pathogens of the species C. trachomatis, cause oculogenital infections and disease syndromes of the eye and genital tract. The incidence of the most prominent disease, endemic trachoma with eye-to-eye transmission, is decreasing all over the world. At the same time there is increasing recognition of high-frequency venereal infections with trachoma organisms and of the genital disease and occasional ocular disease that they cause. Laboratory techniques for diagnosis and investigation are improving, but work with these interesting intermediate agents remains more difficult than that with many other microorganisms. Proper recognition of the diseases is important because specific therapy is available.","['Grayston JT', 'Wang S']",1975,132,1,J Infect Dis,Grayston JT and Wang S.

4214771,Lipid metabolism of monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK-2) infected with Chlamydia trachomatis strain lymphogranuloma venereum.,"Lipid metabolism of monkey kidney (LLC-MK-2) cells and cells infected with a Chlamydia trachomatis strain lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) was studied. The protein-to-lipid ratio of normal MK-2 cells was found to increase linearly over a 60-h period of incubation. The protein-to-lipid ratio of the infected cells was similar to that in normal cells until 36 h after infection, when a plateau in the ratio was observed. Lipid synthesis of the infected cells was found to be inhibited after 48 h of infection. Turnover of host lipids did not appear to be markedly altered by infection with LGV over a 48-h period of incubation. An anteiso branched chain of 15:0 fatty acid was found in infected cells but not in normal cells. The appearance of this fatty acid, correlated with a rise in the infectivity of LGV, suggests that synthesis of specific lipids was associated with the infection.","['Fan VS', 'Jenkin HM']",1974,10,3,Infect Immun,Fan VS and Jenkin HM.

16558075,A simplified method for immunological typing of trachoma-inclusion conjunctivitis-lymphogranuloma venereum organisms.,"Responding to the pressure of large numbers of trachoma-inclusion conjunctivitis (TRIC)-lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) isolates from field studies requiring serotyping, we have developed a simplified, less-precise method that utilizes cell culture-grown organisms to produce mouse antisera which is tested agaist prototype TRIC-LGV antigens in the micro-immunofluorescence test. Cell cultures with as few as 5 to 15% of cells showing inclusions produced adequate antibody in mice 4 days after single injection. Knowledge of the reaction of prototype antisera with the antigens has allowed typing of most isolates tested from the pattern of cross-reaction of their antiserum.","['Wang SP', 'Kuo CC', 'Grayston JT']",1973,7,3,Infect Immun,"Wang SP, et al.

4905529,Lymphogranuloma venereum. II. Characterization of some recently isolated strains.,"Five Bedsonia (Chlamydia) isolates from lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) patients were tested for inclusion type, sulfonamide sensitivity, and mouse virulence. Two matched the classical description of LGV agents. Two were not virulent for mice by the intracerebral route, therefore fitting the description for trachoma-inclusion conjunctivitis agents. One was highly virulent for mice and sulfonamide-resistant, and produced inclusions that did not stain with iodine, all characteristics generally associated with avian bedsoniae. A sixth isolate could not be adequately tested due to poor infective yields. Because of this variety of properties within the Bedsonia group, the term LGV might more appropriately be reserved for clinical disease rather than to describe a particular bedsonial agent.","['Schachter J', 'Meyer KF']",1969,99,3,J Bacteriol,Schachter J and Meyer KF.
