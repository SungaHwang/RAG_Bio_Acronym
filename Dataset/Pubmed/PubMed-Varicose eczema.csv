36800152,"Stasis Dermatitis: An Overview of Its Clinical Presentation, Pathogenesis, and Management.","Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the lower extremities. It typically occurs in older individuals and is the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux. Such retrograde venous blood flow is the result of incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or venous obstruction. Stasis dermatitis is eczematous. The associated impairment of venous valves may cause swelling of the legs, leading to serious conditions including venous ulcerations. Diagnosis can be challenging because of its clinical resemblance to other skin conditions and poor clinical recognition by physicians. The cornerstones of stasis dermatitis treatment are compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes, and interventional treatment options to correct the underlying causes of venous reflux. Given the central role of inflammation of the lower extremities in driving the cutaneous changes characteristic of stasis dermatitis, new therapeutic approaches that target the inflammation are under clinical evaluation in patients with stasis dermatitis.","['Yosipovitch G', 'Nedorost ST', 'Silverberg JI', 'Friedman AJ', 'Canosa JM', 'Cha A']",2023,24,2,Am J Clin Dermatol,"Yosipovitch G, et al.

Photosensitive rash and dermatitis may be caused by many conditions. Hydrochlorothiazide-induced dermatitis is a rare side effect of thiazide diuretics. Early identification of sulfa-sensitivity and photoallergic or phototoxic reaction is essential to accurate diagnosis and treatment of photosensitive dermatitis. Soliciting a targeted history is essential to delineating drug-induced dermatitis from stasis dermatitis. A thorough skin examination can elucidate the focal or extensive nature of the rash and is essential to making an accurate diagnosis.

35600200,Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome: Case series from a university hospital of Nepal.,"INTRODUCTION: Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital malformation with capillary and venous malformations and soft tissue/bony overgrowth with or without lymphatic malformation. Cutaneous vascular stain, varicosities and tissue hypertrophy represent its main clinical features. Besides, the patient can develop thromboembolic pathologies, recurrent bouts of infection, stasis eczema, limb length discrepancy and intolerable pain typical of intraosseous involvement.
METHODS: Here, we report a case series of seven patients aged 10-45 who presented to our centre with clinical features suggestive of KTS. Out of them, six patients had involvement of unilateral lower limb, while only one had involvement of bilateral lower limb. They all had typical cutaneous vascular stains and underlying venous malformation, while one patient had developed complications with multiple ulcer formation.
OUTCOMES: An interdisciplinary team of vascular surgeons, dermatologists, interventional radiologists, orthopaedics, and physiotherapists managed the cases. We performed an individualized treatment as per the patient's presentation, which included a combination of supportive, medical, interventional radiologic, and surgical interventions. The follow-up outcomes of all the patients revealed significant resolution of symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Patients with KTS can have diverse presentations. Therefore, clinicians should ensure an individualized treatment with the involvement of a multidisciplinary team for proper management and prevention of complications.","['Karmacharya RM', 'Vaidya S', 'Bhatt S', 'Tamang A', 'Shrestha RB', 'Bhandari N', 'Paudel B', 'Shah M', 'Nepal G']",2022,78,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Karmacharya RM, et al.

34883526,Injection sclerotherapy for varicose veins.,"BACKGROUND: Varicose veins are enlarged and tortuous veins, affecting up to one-third of the world's population. They can be a cause of chronic venous insufficiency, which is characterised by oedema, pigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, atrophie blanche, and healed or active venous ulcers. Injection sclerotherapy (liquid or foam) is widely used for treatment of varicose veins aiming to transform the varicose veins into a fibrous cord. However, there is limited evidence regarding its effectiveness and safety, especially in patients with more severe disease. This is the second update of the review first published in 2002.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of injection sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins.
SEARCH METHODS: For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, and LILACS databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries, on 20 July 2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster-randomised trials and first phase cross-over studies) that used injection sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed, selected and extracted data. Disagreements were cross-checked by a third review author. We used Cochrane's Risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias. The outcomes of interest were cosmetic appearance, complications, residual varicose veins, quality of life (QoL), persistence of symptoms, and recurrent varicose veins. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the worst-case-scenario for dichotomous data imputation for intention-to-treat analyses. For continuous outcomes, we used the 'last-observation-carried-forward' for data imputation if there was balanced loss to follow-up. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 23 new RCTs for this update, bringing the total to 28 studies involving 4278 participants. The studies differed in their design, and in which sclerotherapy method, agent or concentration was used. None of the included RCTs compared sclerotherapy to no intervention or to any pharmacological therapy. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, low number of studies providing information for each outcome, low number of participants, clinical differences between the study participants, and wide CIs. Sclerotherapy versus placebo Foam sclerotherapy may improve cosmetic appearance as measured by IPR-V (independent photography review - visible varicose veins scores) compared to placebo (polidocanol 1%: mean difference (MD) -0.76, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.60; 2 studies, 223 participants; very low-certainty evidence); however, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rates may be slightly increased in this intervention group (RR 5.10, 95% CI 1.30 to 20.01; 3 studies, 302 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Residual varicose vein rates may be decreased following polidocanol 1% compared to placebo (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.29; 2 studies, 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Following polidocanol 1% use, there may be a possible improvement in QoL as assessed using the VEINES-QOL/Sym questionnaire (MD 12.41, 95% CI 9.56 to 15.26; 3 studies, 299 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and possible improvement in varicose vein symptoms as assessed using the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (MD -3.25, 95% CI -3.90 to -2.60; 2 studies, 223 participants; low-certainty evidence). Recurrent varicose veins were not reported for this comparison. Foam sclerotherapy versus foam sclerotherapy with different concentrations Three individual RCTs reported no evidence of a difference in cosmetic appearance after comparing different concentrations of the intervention; data could not be pooled for two of the three studies (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Similarly, there was no clear difference in rates of thromboembolic complications when comparing one foam concentration with another (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.41 to 5.33; 3 studies, 371 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Three RCTs investigating higher concentrations of polidocanol foam indicated the rate of residual varicose veins may be slightly decreased in the polidocanol 3% foam group compared to 1% (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.04; 3 studies, 371 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No clear improvement in QoL was detected. Two RCTs reported improved VCSS scores with increasing concentrations of foam. Persistence of symptoms were not reported for this comparison. There was no clear difference in recurrent varicose vein rates (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.32; 1 study, 148 participants; low-certainty evidence). Foam sclerotherapy versus liquid sclerotherapy One RCT reported on cosmetic appearance with no evidence of a difference between foam or liquid sclerotherapy (patient satisfaction scale MD 0.2, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.67; 1 study, 126 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the RCTs investigated thromboembolic complications, QoL or persistence of symptoms. Six studies individually showed there may be a benefit to polidocanol 3% foam over liquid sclerotherapy in reducing residual varicose vein rate; pooling data from two studies showed a RR of 0.51, with 95% CI 0.41 to 0.65; 203 participants; very low-certainty evidence. One study reported no clear difference in recurrent varicose vein rates when comparing sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS) foam or liquid (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.42; 1 study, 286 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sclerotherapy versus sclerotherapy with different substances Four RCTs compared sclerotherapy versus sclerotherapy with any other substance. We were unable to combine the data due to heterogeneity or assess the certainty of the evidence due to insufficient data.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a very low to low-certainty evidence that, compared to placebo, sclerotherapy is an effective and safe treatment for varicose veins concerning cosmetic appearance, residual varicose veins, QoL, and persistence of symptoms. Rates of DVT may be slightly increased and there were no data concerning recurrent varicose veins. There was limited or no evidence for one concentration of foam compared to another; foam compared to liquid sclerotherapy; foam compared to any other substance; or one technique compared to another. There is a need for high-quality trials using standardised sclerosant doses, with clearly defined core outcome sets, and measurement time points to increase the certainty of the evidence.","['de Ávila Oliveira R', 'Riera R', 'Vasconcelos V', 'Baptista-Silva JC']",2021,12,12,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"de Ávila Oliveira R, et al.

34334489,Onset Mechanism and Pharmaceutical Management of Dry Skin.,"Dry skin is a common symptom of various conditions, and elderly individuals commonly exhibit this physiological symptom. Dry skin develops owing to sebum deficiency; however, the use of moisturizers can typically overcome this issue, particularly in patients in whom there are no other skin problems. If dry skin is left untreated, itching and eczema can occur, resulting in skin damage. Additionally, hemodialysis patients exhibit reduced barrier function and can experience pain associated with repeated needle insertion; the repeated use of lidocaine tape to manage the pain can cause further skin damage. To reduce the occurrence of dry skin, the skin is hydrated using moisturizers. Dry skin is also prominent in patients with varicose veins in the lower extremities, and many biochemical studies have shown that skin immunity is altered in patients with dry skin. Moreover, the incidences of dry skin and pruritus differ in male and female patients. Furthermore, in elderly patients, zinc deficiency is likely to cause dry skin, and zinc supplementation may maintain skin hydration. To date, few reports have described dry skin from a clinical point of view. In this review, research on dry skin is presented, and the findings of basic research studies are integrated.",['Ooi K'],2021,44,8,Biol Pharm Bull,Ooi K.

34171953,What's new in the 2020 update of the CEAP classification system of chronic venous disease?,"The aim of the 2020 update of the CEAP (Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology) classification is provide the reproducibility of clinical findings between physicians, enable comparison of old and new versions of the CEAP classification, incorporate new evidence- based knowledge into the classification, and provide a balance between simple practical use and highly specific and detailed description of patient with chronic venous disease (CVD) in clinical and other studies. Clinical (C) classification remained unchanged and clinical definitions of all seven classes C0-C6 have been preserved. Class C4 is newly divided into three subclasses: C4a - pigmentation or eczema, C4b - lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche and corona phlebectatica as the C4c clinical subclass has been added. Classes C2 (varicose veins) and C6 (active venous ulcer) are divided into subclasses C2R - recurrent varicose veins and C6R - recurrent active venous ulcer. Etiological (E) classification has not changed, more information on the subgroups has been recommended, resulting in a clearer description of each E subclass. ES is subcategorized to recognize intravenous secondary causes of venous disease (ESI), which is defined as any intravenous condition causing venous wall and/or valve damage; and extravenous secondary causes (ESE), in which case there is no venous wall or valve damage, yet symptoms are present owing to a condition affecting venous hemodynamics either locally or systemically. No cause identified category (EN) is defined of exclusion. The EN descriptor should be present when no other venous etiology (EC, EP, ESI or ESE) is found, yet there are clinical signs and symptoms that can be consistent with those typically associated with venous disease. In the Anatomical (A) classification anatomic abbreviations are now used instead of numbers of the venous segments. Pathophysiological (P) classification has not changed and the basic designation still includes four pathophysiological categories - reflux (PR), obstruction (PO), reflux and obstruction (PR/O), no venous pathophysiology (PN) with the addition of any (one or more) of named specific A anatomic venous segments according to the newly introduced abbreviations.",['Musil D'],2021,67,3,Vnitr Lek,Musil D.

33708219,Treatment of Chronic Venous Ulcers With Heterologous Fibrin Sealant: A Phase I/II Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Heterologous fibrin sealant (HFS) consists of a fibrinogen-rich cryoprecipitate extracted from 
METHODS: A phase I/II non-randomized, single-arm clinical trial was performed on 31 participants, accounting for a total of 69 active CVUs. All ulcers were treated with HFS, essential fatty acid, and Unna boot for 12 weeks. The outcomes assessed were: (1) primary safety, immunogenicity analyses, and confirmation of the lowest safe dose; (2) secondary promising efficacy by analyzing the healing process. Immunogenicity was evaluated using the serum-neutralizing (IgM and IgG) and non-neutralizing (IgA and IgE) antibody techniques against the product. The immuno-detection of IgE class antibodies was assessed using dot-blot assay before and at the end of treatment. Positive samples on dot-blot assays were subsequently analyzed by western blotting to verify the results.
RESULTS: No severe systemic adverse events related to the use of HFS were observed. Local adverse events potentially related to treatment include ulcer pain (52%), peri-ulcer maceration (16%), peri-ulcer pruritus (12%), critical colonization (8%), peri-ulcer eczema (4%), the opening of new ulcers (4%), and increased ulcerated area 4%). Neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies did not show significant deviations at any of the evaluated time points. Blot assays showed that all patients presented negative immunological reactions, either before or after treatment, with the thrombin-like enzyme component. In addition, two participants showed a positive immunological reaction to the cryoprecipitate component, while another two were positive before and during treatment. Regarding the secondary outcomes of preliminary efficacy, a total healing and significant reduction of the area was observed in 47.5 and 22%, respectively. A qualitative improvement was observed in the wound beds of unhealed ulcers.
CONCLUSIONS: The investigational HFS bioproduct proved to be safe and non-immunogenic with a good preliminary efficacy for the treatment of CVU, according to the protocol and doses proposed. A multicentric phase III clinical trial will be necessary to verify these findings.","['Abbade LPF', 'Barraviera SRCS', 'Silvares MRC', 'Lima ABBCO', 'Haddad GR', 'Gatti MAN', 'Medolago NB', 'Rigotto Carneiro MT', 'Dos Santos LD', 'Ferreira RS', 'Barraviera B']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Abbade LPF, et al.

32402427,Update of the SFMV (French society of vascular medicine) guidelines on the conditions and safety measures necessary for thermal ablation of the saphenous veins and proposals for unresolved issues.,"Venous insufficiency is a very common disease affecting about 25% of the French population (if we combine all stages of its progression). It is a complex disease and its aetiology has not yet been fully elucidated. Some of its causes are well known, such as valvular dysfunction, vein wall defect, and the suctioning effect common to all varicose veins. These factors are generally associated and together lead to dysfunction of one or more of the saphenous veins. Saphenous vein dysfunction is revealed by ultrasound scan, a reflux lasting more than 0.5 seconds indicating venous incompetence. The potential consequences of saphenous vein dysfunction over time include: symptoms (heaviness, swellings, restlessness, cramps, itching of the lower limbs), acute complications (superficial venous thrombosis, varicose bleeding), chronic complications (changes in skin texture and colour, stasis dermatitis, eczema, vein atresia, leg ulcer), and appearance of unaesthetic varicose veins. It is not possible to repair an incompetent saphenous vein. The only therapeutic options at present are ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, physical removal of the vein (saphenous stripping), or its thermal ablation (by laser or radiofrequency treatment), the latter strategy having now become the gold standard as recommended by international guidelines. Recommendations concerning thermal ablation of saphenous veins were published in 2014 by the Société française de médecine vasculaire. Our society has now decided to update these recommendations, taking this opportunity to discuss unresolved issues and issues not addressed in the original guidelines. Thermal ablation of an incompetent saphenous vein consists in destroying this by means of a heating element introduced via ultrasound-guided venous puncture. The heating element comprises either a laser fibre or a radiofrequency catheter. The practitioner must provide the patient with full information about the procedure and obtain his/her consent prior to its implementation. The checklist concerning the interventional procedure issued by the HAS should be validated for each patient (see the appended document).","['Gracia S', 'Miserey G', 'Risse J', 'Abbadie F', 'Auvert JF', 'Chauzat B', 'Combes P', 'Creton D', 'Creton O', 'Da Mata L', 'Diard A', 'Giordana P', 'Josnin M', 'Keïta-Perse O', 'Lasheras A', 'Ouvry P', 'Pichot O', 'Skopinski S', 'Mahé G']",2020,45,3,J Med Vasc,"Gracia S, et al.

31531971,Compression therapy for treating post-thrombotic syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) characterised by chronic complaints such as oedema and skin changes including; venous ectasia, varicose veins, redness, eczema, hyperpigmentation, and in severe cases fibrosis of the subcutaneous adipose in the affected limb. These chronic complaints are the effects of venous outflow restriction that can cause symptoms such as heaviness, itching, pain, cramps, and paraesthesia. Twenty to fifty percent of people with DVT develop post-thrombotic complications. Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of PTS during the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and compression therapy. There have been limited studies regarding the effectiveness of compression therapy for prevention or treatment of PTS. As a result, clinicians and guidelines differ in their assessment of compression therapy during treatment of DVT and in the treatment of PTS. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of compression therapy for treatment of post-thrombotic syndrome, including elastic compression stockings and mechanical devices compared with no intervention, placebo and with each other.
SEARCH METHODS: For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries on 2 July 2018.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included trials that evaluated compression therapy for the treatment of PTS. The primary outcomes were severity of PTS and adverse effects. There were no restrictions on date or language. Two review authors (SA, DNK) independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author extracted and summarised data and one review author (DNK) verified them. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We assessed methodological study quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified four trials, with 116 participants, investigating the effectiveness of compression therapy for treatment of PTS. The methodology used by each trial was too heterogeneous to perform a meta-analysis, so we reported our findings narratively.Two trials studied the effect of graduated elastic compression stockings (GECS) on improvement of PTS symptoms. One study reported beneficial haemodynamic effects, while the other found no benefits on PTS severity compared to placebo (very low-certainty evidence). There was very limited evidence available for adverse effects and quality of life (QoL). The two studies did not report on compliance rates during the study period.Two trials studied the effects of intermittent mechanical compression devices. Both reported improvement in PTS severity (low-certainty evidence). Improvement of the severity of PTS was defined by treatment 'success' or 'failure'. Only one study comparing compression devices evaluated adverse effects and QoL. Although 9% of the participants experienced adverse effects such as leg swelling, irritation, superficial bleeding, and skin itching (moderate-certainty evidence), QoL was improved (moderate-certainty evidence). Studies did not assess compliance using intermittent mechanical compression devices.None of the studies evaluated patient satisfaction.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very low-certainty evidence regarding the use of GECS for treatment of PTS as assessed by two small studies of short duration. One study reported beneficial haemodynamic effects, while one found no benefits on PTS severity compared to control/placebo stockings. There is very limited evidence for adverse effects, patient satisfaction, QoL, and compliance rates. There is low-certainty evidence favouring use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices compared to a control device for the treatment of severity owing to different measurements used by the studies reporting on this outcome and small studies of short duration. There is moderate-certainty evidence of improved QoL but possible increased adverse effects related to compression device use owing to small studies of short duration. High-certainty evidence to support the use of compression therapy in prevention of PTS is lacking and any conclusions drawn from current evidence should be interpreted with care. Further research is needed to assess whether compression can result in long-term reduction and relief of the symptoms caused by PTS, or prevent deterioration and leg ulceration.","['Azirar S', 'Appelen D', 'Prins MH', 'Neumann MH', 'de Feiter AN', 'Kolbach DN']",2019,9,9,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Azirar S, et al.

31393801,Rapid debridement with monofilament fibre debridement technology: clinical outcomes and practitioner satisfaction.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effect and consequential levels of health professionals and patient satisfaction with the results of debridement episodes of wounds with visible slough and/or scaly skin using monofilament fibre debridement technology.
METHODS: This was a non-comparative, open label evaluation conducted in static/non-healing acute and chronic wounds with visible slough and/or scaly skin that required debridement. Monofilament fibre debridement technology was applied in 1-2 sequential treatment episodes during normal clinical practice which followed local practice, guidelines or formularies. Following the clinical phase of the evaluation, health professionals were invited to complete an online survey of the clinical outcomes and their satisfaction with them.
RESULTS: Survey questions were answered by 1129 health professionals. Wounds managed using the monofilament fibre debridement technology during this evaluation included leg ulcers (63%), pressure ulcers (10%), dehisced surgical wounds (3%), diabetic foot ulcers (8%) and other wounds (13%). 'Other' wound types included acute dirty wounds, burns, cellulitis, psoriasis, diabetic amputation wounds, dry flaky skin, moisture wounds, trauma, varicose eczema. Of the wounds, 12% were reported as non-static. There was visible change in the wound and/or skin after first use of the monofilament fibre debridement technology in a high proportion of all wound types, and a further increase in the proportion of wounds with visible change after the second use. The visible difference was significant for both static and non-static wounds. User and patient satisfaction with all clinical outcomes were high, whether or not the user and patient had previous experience of monofilament fibre debridement technology.
CONCLUSION: Monofilament fibre debridement technology provides rapid, visible and effective debridement of slough and scaly skin after one application and further visible improvement after two applications in static and non-static wounds. Health professionals and patients report high levels of satisfaction with outcomes following application of the monofilament fibre debridement technology.","['Roes C', 'Calladine L', 'Morris C']",2019,28,8,J Wound Care,"Roes C, et al.

30687958,Lower limb cellulitis: low diagnostic accuracy and underdiagnosis of risk factors.,"Accurate diagnosis and recognition of predisposing factors has been shown to be challenging in lower limb cellulitis (LLC). Assessment of 1746 consecutive patients with cellulitis presenting to a UK university hospital showed increasing overdiagnosis, with only 31.9% of patients referred during the period 2015-2018 having the diagnosis of LLC confirmed. Recognition of at least one predisposing factor increased from 61% to 89% following introduction of more specific screening questions. This identified a need for better primary care dermatology education and the benefit of a proforma with specific screening questions for reversible predisposing factors for LLC.","['Mistry K', 'Sutherland M', 'Levell NJ']",2019,44,5,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Mistry K, et al.

29197190,Percutaneous treatment with radiofrequency ablation of varicose veins recurring after vein stripping surgery A preliminary study.,"AIM: The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new treatment of recurrent varicose vein after stripping of the great saphenous vein with rigid radiofrequency needles.
MATERIAL OF STUDY: 37 patients enrolled (11 males and 26 females). 10 patients had recurrent varicose veins for the presence of residual reflux in the Saphenous-Femoral Junction (SFJ) stump, whilst 21 patients for the presence of a single or multiple re-chanalized and refluxing perforator veins, and 6 had mixed rechanalization due to perforator veins and refluxing saphenous stump. All patients have been treated by percutaneous ultrasound-guided obliteration with radiofrequency needles. Treatment efficacy have been assessed by US evaluation, and/or the appearance of recurrent varicose veins and classified as REVAS questionnaire. Follow up has been carried out at 30, 60, 180 days and 1 year after treatment.
RESULTS: A complete obliteration of the perforator(s) stump(s) was observed in 12 procedures immediately after the treatment, and confirmed at 30 and 60 days. In 1 case (7.69 %) obliteration was not complete at 60 days. After 1 year of follow-up 3 perforators (23.07%) showed an incomplete or failed obliteration. A complete obliteration of the treated SFJ was observed in 27 cases at the end of the procedure and confirmed after 60 days of follow-up patients (Fig. 4). In 2 cases (6.89%), obliteration was non complete at 60 days. After 1 year of follow up 5 treated SFJ (17.24%) stumps showed an incomplete or a failed obliteration.
DISCUSSION: Results show a reduction of the number of limbs affected by ulcer, skin pigmentation and stasis eczema, demonstrating correction of haemodynamic overload to be effective.
CONCLUSIONS: This treatment is a new and effective solution to the problem of post-stripping recurrent varicose veins.

29143961,Upregulation of epidermal gap junctional proteins in patients with venous disease.,"BACKGROUND: Leg ulceration is a feared complication of venous insufficiency. It is not known whether varicose veins predispose skin to poor wound healing. The expression pattern of gap junctional protein connexin, a known marker of poor wound healing, was investigated across various stages of venous disease.
METHODS: Patients undergoing intervention for varicose veins were assessed according to the Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic (CEAP) classification of varicose veins. Paired 4-mm punch biopsies were taken from above the ankle (pathological) and above the knee (control). Tissues were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and for connexin 43, connexin 30 and connexin 26.
RESULTS: Forty-eight paired biopsies were taken (12 each for CEAP class C0, C2, C4 and C6). The pathological skin showed progressive epithelial hyperthickening, an increase in the number and depth of rete ridges, increased inflammation and loss of dermal architecture with disease progression from C4 onwards. The overall absolute connexin expression and mean connexin expression per cell in the pathological skin similarly increased across the CEAP classes from as early as C2. Increasing levels of connexin in control skin were also noted, indicating progression of the disease proximally. Connexin 43 expression showed the strongest positive correlation between pathological and control skin.
CONCLUSION: Connexins were overexpressed in patients with simple varicose veins, with a stepwise increased expression through venous eczema to ulceration. Connexin 43 is a potential biomarker for venous disease. This finding suggests that varicose veins predispose skin to poor wound healing. Surgical relevance The overexpression of connexins, a family of gap junctional proteins, is known to cause poor healing in venous leg ulceration. It is not known whether there is any association with superficial venous disease. Here, connexin proteins were overexpressed in patients with uncomplicated varicose veins, before histological skin changes. Connexin could be a biomarker of venous disease progression.","['Kanapathy M', 'Simpson R', 'Madden L', 'Thrasivoulou C', 'Mosahebi A', 'Becker DL', 'Richards T']",2018,105,1,Br J Surg,"Kanapathy M, et al.

28265131,Medical Treatment for Postthrombotic Syndrome.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a prevalent disease. About 20 to 30% of patients with DVT will develop postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) within months after the initial diagnosis of DVT. There is no gold standard for diagnosis of PTS, but clinical signs include pitting edema, hyperpigmentation, phlebectatic crown, venous eczema, and varicose veins. Several scoring systems have been developed for diagnostic evaluation. Conservative treatment includes compression therapy, medications, lifestyle modification, and exercise. Compression therapy, the mainstay and most proven noninvasive therapy for patients with PTS, can be prescribed as compression stockings, bandaging, adjustable compression wrap devices, and intermittent pneumatic compression. Medications may be used to both prevent and treat PTS and include anticoagulation, anti-inflammatories, vasoactive drugs, antibiotics, and diuretics. Exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation, and leg elevation are also recommended. Areas of further research include the duration, compliance, and strength of compression stockings in the prevention of PTS after DVT; the use of intermittent compression devices; the optimal medical anticoagulant regimen after endovascular therapy; and the role of newer anticoagulants as anti-inflammatory agents.","['Palacios FS', 'Rathbun SW']",2017,34,1,Semin Intervent Radiol,Palacios FS and Rathbun SW.

28139903,Endovenous laser ablation in patients with severe primary chronic venous insufficiency.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of study was to estimate the safety and efficacy of using laser wavelength of 1560 nm with the foam sclerotherapy (FS) of varicose veins (VVs) for the treatment of severe primary chronic venous insufficiency (CVI, C4-C6) in patients with different diameters of the proximal segment (DPS) of the great saphenous vein (GSV).
METHODS: We have separated the patients into two groups depending on the size of GSV: group 1 (281 cases; DPS of GSV less than 15 mm) and group 2 (210 cases; DPS of GSV more than 15 mm). Both groups received the endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of the saphenous vein trunk, incompetent perforator veins (IPs) and FS (Tessari method) of VVs. The linear endovenous energy density (LEED) was personalized depending on the vein size.
RESULTS: The healing of ulcers and resolution of venous eczema in 6 months were considered the primary end-point. Healing of ulcers was found in 45/55 (82%) cases in group 1 and in 31/35 (88%) cases in group 2. The resolution of venous eczema in 56 (80%) from 70 cases in group 1 and 45 (85%) from 53 cases in group 2 was observed. Leg ulcer recurrence at 3 years' follow-up in 7.3% cases in group 1 and 8.6% cases in group 2 was determined.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience of using laser wavelength of 1560 nm and FS of VVs for the treatment of severe primary CVI shows the safety and efficacy of this technique in patients with different DPS of GSV.","['Starodubtsev V', 'Lukyanenko M', 'Karpenko A', 'Ignatenko P']",2017,36,4,Int Angiol,"Starodubtsev V, et al.

29911374,Clinical Characteristics of Thai Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the demographic and clinical presentations as assessed by Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) and Venous Disability Score (VDS) in Thai Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) patients.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data
RESULTS: There were 78 CVI patients (102 legs) with the mean age of 59.6 years and 42% spending more than 75% of working hours upright. The proportional of C4, 5 and 6 were 24.4%, 9.0% and 66.7%. The mean BMI was 26.9. Seven legs (6.9%) had prior history of DVT. In 90 legs with no previous operation, the mean VCSS and VDS were 9.8 and 0.9 respectively. The mean VCSS for C4, C5 and C5 were 7.1,7.0 and 12.1. Pain was perceived in 50% and associated with venous eczema. The combined superficial and deep vein reflux were found in 57.8%. Overall, the prevalence of superficial and deep vein reflux was 80.0% and 63.3%. The venous pulsatile arterial wave was found in 3.3%. The visible varicose veins were found in only 50.0% and tended to be mild.
CONCLUSION: The symptoms are mild. Despite low prior DVT rate, the prevalence of deep vein reflux is high and commonly combined with superficial vein reflux. Reflux commonly located below the knee, adjacent to the ulcers. Visible varicose are infrequent but most of those veins are associated with reflux.","['Kanchanabat B', 'Ruangsetakit C', 'Stapanavatr W']",2017,100,1,J Med Assoc Thai,"Kanchanabat B, et al.

27257482,A multicenter review of epidemiology and management of varicose veins for national guidance.,"BACKGROUND: Varicose vein is a common surgical problems in India. This study was done to assess the clinico-epidemiological profile, risk factors and management practices in varicose veins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 170 varicose vein cases admitted in tertiary care hospitals in Mangalore between May 2011 to April 2014 were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Majority of cases 53(31.2%) were of the age group 41-50 years. Majority were males 127(74.7%) and majority were unskilled workers 101(59.4%). Superficial veins were involved in 123(72.4%) cases. Perforator followed by great saphenous vein were most frequently involved. Veins on the left side were more involved than on the right. Common symptoms at the time of presentation was ulceration 98(57.6%) followed by pain in the legs 96(56.5%). Ulceration was seen significantly more among females (p = 0.027) and among house wives (p = 0.004). Complications like eczema 46(27.1%), non-healing ulcers 21(12.3%) and deep vein thrombosis 10(5.9%) were reported among cases. Eczema was present significantly more among elderly patients aged above 60 years (p = 0.019). Risk factors like prolonged standing was observed in 86(50.6%) cases. This history was significantly seen among males (p = 0.001) and among those involved in unskilled occupations (p < 0.001). Recurrence of varicose vein was reported in 23(13.5%) cases. It was associated with patients of the age group 21-30 years (p = 0.021). Doppler ultrasound was the most common 120(70.6%) investigation done. Micronized purified flavonoid fraction was used in management in 15(8.8%) cases. Conservative management methods like limb elevation 50(29.4%) and compression stocking 36(21.2%) was advised to patients. Saphenous vein stripping was the most common surgical procedure 40(23.5%) performed.
CONCLUSION: The high risk groups identified in this study need to be made aware of risk of developing varicose veins. Use of compression stocking at work place added with newer procedure in management could help in betterment in their quality of life.","['Joseph N', 'B A', 'Faizan Thouseef M', 'Devi M U', 'Abna A', 'Juneja I']",2016,8,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Joseph N, et al.

26755477,Cost Analysis of Selected Patient Categories Within A Dermatology Department Using an ABC Approach.,"BACKGROUND: Present trends in hospital management are facilitating the utilization of more accurate costing methods, which potentially results in superior cost-related information and improved managerial decision-making. However, the Activity-Based Costing method (ABC), which was designed for cost allocation purposes in the 1980s, is not widely used by healthcare organizations. This study analyzes costs related to selected categories of patients, those suffering from psoriasis, varicose ulcers, eczema and other conditions, within a dermatology department at a Czech regional hospital.
METHODS: The study was conducted in a hospital department where both inpatient and outpatient care are offered. Firstly, the diseases treated at the department were identified. Further costs were determined for each activity using ABC. The study utilized data from managerial and financial accounting, as well as data obtained through interviews with departmental staff. Using a defined cost-allocation procedure makes it possible to determine the cost of an individual patient with a given disease more accurately than via traditional costing procedures.
RESULTS: The cost analysis focused on the differences between the costs related to individual patients within the selected diagnoses, variations between inpatient and outpatient treatments and the costs of activities performed by the dermatology department. Furthermore, comparing the costs identified through this approach and the revenue stemming from the health insurance system is an option.
CONCLUSIONS: Activity-Based Costing is more accurate and relevant than the traditional costing method. The outputs of ABC provide an abundance of additional information for managers. The benefits of this research lie in its practically-tested outputs, resulting from calculating the costs of hospitalization, which could prove invaluable to persons involved in hospital management and decision-making. The study also defines the managerial implications of the performed cost analysis for the hospital management. Based on the analysis results, it is possible to standardize activities and performance appraisal (Benchmarking), and provide all necessary information for hospital budgeting practices, especially Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB).","['Papadaki Š', 'Popesko B']",2015,8,6,Glob J Health Sci,Papadaki Š and Popesko B.

26507886,Patients' experiences of living with varicose veins and management of the disease in daily life.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim was to describe the experience of living with varicose veins classified according CEAP (clinical class, aetiology, anatomy, pathophysiology) as C4 (eczema or thrombophlebitis) and management of the disease in daily life.
BACKGROUND: Primary chronic venous insufficiencies with varicose veins are a relatively common condition among both men and women. Several studies have shown that quality of life improved after treatment of varicose veins compared to before treatment. This suggests that patients with a milder form of varicose veins such as C4 experience a negative influence on their quality of life before treatment.
DESIGN: This is an explorative qualitative study with a phenomenological approach.
METHOD: A purposive sample was used, and 12 in-depth interviews were conducted with persons having superficial venous insufficiency classified C4. A descriptive phenomenological analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The essence of the phenomenon of living with varicose veins classified C4 and management of the disease in daily life meant adapting to a life with varicose veins and relieve discomfort from legs with an unfavourable appearance. Coping with discomfort involved dealing with the disease emotionally and finding strategies that helped to relieve symptoms; however, living with 'repulsive' legs was seen as embarrassing, and many found the need to hide their condition.
CONCLUSION: Patients with varicose veins classified C4 had notable symptoms of the disease that affected daily living. This in turn required the use of different coping strategies to manage symptoms, and significant adjustments related to activities and social life were made.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It seems desirable that patients with varicose veins receive treatment at an earlier stage of the disease and are familiar with the tools and solutions available to alleviate symptoms and avoid a negative impact on daily life.","['Franz A', 'Wann-Hansson C']",2016,25,5-6,J Clin Nurs,Franz A and Wann-Hansson C.

26148310,Skin disorders in elderly subjects.,"BACKGROUND: Skin problems in the elderly population have rarely been the subject of scientific research.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to determine the prevalences of the most common dermatological conditions in elderly subjects and to investigate their associations with systemic diseases.
METHODS: The study involved a group of 198 consecutive patients aged ≥ 65 years who were admitted to the Departments of Dermatology and Geriatrics at the study institution. All participants were thoroughly evaluated in a clinical interview and physical examination in which special emphasis was placed on dermatological issues.
RESULTS: All subjects presented at least one dermatological condition. A significant correlation was found between the number of systemic diseases and the number of different skin lesions observed. The most common skin disorders included solar lentigines, senile angiomas, xerosis, seborrheic warts, varicose veins, edema of the lower legs, and pruritus. Patients aged ≥ 75 years demonstrated solar lentigines, edema of the lower legs, clavi, solar keratoses, and onychomycosis significantly more often, whereas patients aged < 75 years suffered more frequently from psoriasis. Diabetes was associated with the development of onychomycosis; hypercholesterolemia promoted the incidence of xanthomas and drug-induced skin reactions; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with senile purpura; and hypothyroidism favored the occurrence of varicose veins in the lower legs and telogen effluvium.
CONCLUSIONS: Skin disorders are common in elderly people. Systemic diseases promote the development of dermatological conditions.

26025146,Chronic venous disease and venous leg ulcers: An evidence-based update.,"Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a complex chronic vascular condition with multifaceted primary and secondary etiologies leading to structural and functional changes in veins and valves and blood flow of the lower legs. As a consequence, a spectrum of clinical manifestations arise, ranging from symptoms of mild leg heaviness and achiness to debilitating pain, and signs of skin changes, such as eczema and hemosiderosis, to nonhealing, heavily draining venous leg ulcers (VLUs). Triggers such as trauma to the skin are responsible for a large majority of VLU recurrences. Diagnostic testing for venous reflux includes ultrasound imaging; unfortunately, there are no diagnostic tests to predict VLUs. The hallmark of treatment of both CVD and VLUs is compression. Leg elevation, exercise, and wound management with dressings and advanced healing technologies that provide an environment conducive to healing should focus on reducing pain, necrotic debris, drainage, and odor, as well as preventing infection. VLUs that become chronic without evidence of healing over a 4-week period respond best to multidisciplinary wound experts within a framework of patient-centered care. Nurses are in key positions to provide early recognition of the signs and symptoms as well as initiate prompt diagnostic and promote early treatment to offset the progression of the disease and improve quality of life.","['Kelechi TJ', 'Johnson JJ', 'Yates S']",2015,33,2,J Vasc Nurs,"Kelechi TJ, et al.

25950393,A glossary of terms to assist the recognition and diagnosis of skin conditions associated with lower-limb chronic oedema.,"There are a number of recognised skin conditions associated with chronic oedema, but the lack of agreed definitions and terminology often leads to poor recognition and a delay in treatment. Many patients are given a diagnostic 'label' (e.g. varicose eczema) that often turns out to be incorrect, leading to an interruption in the patient pathway. Every skin condition can be described in a variety of ways and each professional group adheres to certain phrases and words that, within each discipline, are recognised, but when making onward referral or working between professions, it helps to have clear and concise definitions.

25818405,Estimating the costs associated with the management of patients with chronic wounds using linked routine data.,"Chronic wounds are known to represent a significant burden to patients and National Health Service (NHS) alike. However, previous attempts to estimate the costs associated with the management of chronic wounds have been based on literature studies or broad estimates derived from incidence rates and extrapolations from relatively small-scale studies. The aim of this study is therefore to determine the extent of resource utilisation by patients classed as having chronic wounds within Wales using linked routine data - available through the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) database - to estimate the costs associated with the management of these patients by the NHS in Wales. The SAIL database brings together, and anonymously links, a wide range of person-based data from general practitioner (GP) practices within Wales, which includes primary and secondary care consultations to create an encrypted anonymised linking field for each individual. This linkage allows the patient pathway to be tracked through the NHS system both retrospectively and prospectively from a specific reference date. The estimated costs were derived by extrapolating to an all-Wales level from the results gleaned from the SAIL database using the respective READ codes to capture relevant patients with chronic wounds. The number of patients identified as having chronic wounds within the SAIL database was 78 090, which equates to 190 463 across Wales as a whole and a prevalence of 6% of the Welsh population. The total cost of managing patients with chronic wounds in Wales amounted to £328·8 million - an average cost of £1727 per patient and 5·5% of total expenditure on the health service in Wales. A relatively few READ codes represented a significant proportion of expenditure, with diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers, foot ulcers, varicose eczema, bed sores and postoperative wound care constituting 93% of total expenditure. When a more conservative perspective was used in relation to classification of chronic wounds, the total cost amounted to £303 million. However, these are likely to be underestimates because of the lack of information for patients with treatments lasting over 6 months and not including patients who might have entered the health care system of wound management elsewhere - such as patients contracting pressure ulcers in hospitals and having surgical wound infections.","['Phillips CJ', 'Humphreys I', 'Fletcher J', 'Harding K', 'Chamberlain G', 'Macey S']",2016,13,6,Int Wound J,"Phillips CJ, et al.

Also, disease features such as: intensity of pain, edema and inflammatory response that exerted the most profound effect on different domains of QoL are reported. The global QoL in patients with lower leg venous ulcerations was relatively similar to that observed in other patients with chronic venous insufficiency. The presence of venous ulcerations was associated with lower QoL in a Physical domain. Significant correlations were found between pain intensity and the values of Physical, Physiological, Level of Independence and Environmental domains, between edema intensity and Social domain as well as between the intensity of inflammatory response and Physical and Spiritual domains.","['Tracz E', 'Zamojska E', 'Modrzejewski A', 'Zaborski D', 'Grzesiak W']",2015,29,2,Holist Nurs Pract,"Tracz E, et al.

25349049,Contribution of C-glucosidic ellagitannins to Lythrum salicaria L. influence on pro-inflammatory functions of human neutrophils.,"The herb Lythrum salicaria L. (Lythraceae) is used in traditional medicine to treat diseases with an inflammatory background, such as haemorrhoidal disease, dysentery, chronic intestinal catarrh, eczema, varicose veins, periodontosis and gingivitis. Because these diseases are closely associated with an excessive inflammatory response of stimulated neutrophils, the influence of aqueous extract and isolated C-glucosidic ellagitannins (dimeric salicarinins A, B and C, vescalagin, castalagin) on their pro-inflammatory functions was examined. Lythrum salicaria aqueous extract was shown to modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered production of IL-8 (at 20 μg/mL, 16.6 ± 4.2 % inhibition) but had no influence on MMP-9 production. It was active towards cytochalasin A/f-MLP- stimulated elastase release (at 20 μg/mL, 21.5 ± 3.9 % inhibition), myeloperoxidase release (at 1 μg/mL, 26.5 ± 5.4 % inhibition) and f-MLP- and PMA-induced reactive oxygen species production (at 20 μg/mL, 67.0 ± 3.9 and 66.5 ± 1.9 % inhibition, respectively). The extract was also shown to inhibit expression of integrin CD11b on the neutrophil surface without influencing selectin CD62L shedding. Dose-dependent inhibition of hyaluronidase activity was observed with IC50 = 10.1 ± 1.2 μg/mL. The main C-glucosidic ellagitannins were shown to be responsible for all these activities with more significant participation attributable to dimeric salicarinins A, B, C. This study has demonstrated potent activity of aqueous extract on stimulated neutrophils; this enhanced response is known to cause pathological changes in skin and mucosa tissues. These observations support and explain the traditional use of the herb Lythrum salicaria to treat certain diseases with an inflammatory background. C-glucosidic ellagitannins, especially dimeric salicarinins, are the factors responsible for these effects.","['Piwowarski JP', 'Kiss AK']",2015,69,1,J Nat Med,Piwowarski JP and Kiss AK.

25283621,Treatment of varicose veins in Denmark.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to report the treatment of varicose veins in Denmark in the five-year period from 2007 to 2011, primarily based on reports to the nationwide Clinical Vein Database (KVD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The KVD collects clinical patient data before, during and after invasive treatment of varicose veins in public hospitals, private outpatient clinics and private hospitals.
RESULTS: A slight decrease was observed in the total number of treated legs from about 15,000 annually to nearly 14,000 during the period. Public hospitals and private outpatient clinics treat an almost equal number of patients, whereas private hospitals perform 3% of the treatments. The coverage rate of KVD in public hospitals has been almost complete (94%), but it has been approx. 40% in private outpatient clinics and private hospitals. In 84% of the legs, there were only subjective complaints. The remaining 16% had developed complications, i.e. eczema, varicophlebitis, ulcers or bleeding. Operations still make up the vast majority of the procedures, and although the number of endovenous procedures has increased during the period, these procedures account for only 15% of the procedures performed in 2011. Of all legs, 36% had previously been treated for varicose veins.
CONCLUSION: The literature and our results show that there has been no significant change in the number of varicose vein treatments in Denmark for the past 20 years. Endovenous procedures still account for a small number of the procedures. Despite the increased focus on the treatment of varicose veins, just as many patients are treated for recurrence as in the 1990s.

24912834,Incorporating novel solutions to lower-limb problems into compression formularies.,"This study investigates the effect of a new short-stretch two-layer compression system in eight patients with common chronic lower-limb conditions in three locations in the UK. Chronic leg ulcers are the most common type of lower-limb ulceration with 70% caused by chronic venous hypertension. An appropriate level of compression is proven to heal chronic venous leg ulcers. The study was only a small sample of patients; however, the underlying conditions included chronic venous eczema, diabetes, sarcoma, cellulitis and mixed-aetiology ulcers. During the study, the UK experienced some of the hottest temperatures in the last 30 years. This had an impact on five patients, who noted an increase in malodour associated with their leg ulcers. CoFlex TLC (Aspen Medical Europe Ltd) foam comfort layer is impregnated with cyclodextrin-a naturally based oligosaccharide known to reduce malodour. The zinc-impregnated foam bandages in this study were viewed very favourably by both patients and staff, particularly those who had chronic venous eczema.","['Smith G', 'Simon D', 'McDermott E', 'Gibson E']",2014,Suppl,,Br J Community Nurs,"Smith G, et al.

24840970,Management of venous ulcers.,"Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) results from venous hypertension secondary to superficial or deep venous valvular reflux, as well as venous obstruction. The most severe clinical manifestation of CVI is venous leg ulceration that can result in significant morbidity, including venous gangrene and amputation, albeit rare. Treatment modalities are aimed at reducing venous hypertension. Diuretic therapy, although widely used, only provides short-term improvement of the edema but provides no long-term benefit. Compression therapy is the cornerstone in the management of CVI. Compression can be achieved using compression bandaging, compression pumps, or graduated compression stockings. Topical steroid creams may reduce inflammation, venous eczema, and pain in the short term, but they can be detrimental in the long run. Apligraf (a living, bilayered, cell-based product) in conjunction with compression therapy was noted to be more effective in healing venous leg ulcerations, when compared with treatment with compression therapy and zinc paste. Endovascular and surgical techniques that minimize valvular reflux and relieve venous obstruction improve venous hemodynamics, promoting wound healing.",['Kolluri R'],2014,17,2,Tech Vasc Interv Radiol,Kolluri R.

23619443,Sclerotherapy in the management of varicose veins and its dermatological complications.,"BACKGROUND: Varicose veins and its dermatological complications like stasis dermatitis, ulcers, spontaneous bleeding are commonly seen in the dermatology clinics. Surgery has been the most often used treatment for varicose veins. Sclerotherapy refers to introduction of sclerosing solution into the varicose veins, which causes endothelial damage and subsequent fibrosis. Sclerotherapy is being practised extensively by dermatosurgeons in the west. However, there are no Indian studies which specifically evaluate the role of sclerotherapy in the management of varicose veins and its skin complications. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy of sclerotherapy in managing varicose veins and its complications.
AIMS: To study the safety and efficacy of sclerotherapy in the treatment of varicose veins and its dermatological complications.
METHODS: This is a prospective study involving 50 patients with varicose veins and its dermatological complications attending the dermatology out-patient department. The study was conducted over a period of 18 months. After thorough clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation, the patients were treated with sclerotherapy using Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate of various concentrations depending on the vessel size. The patients were then followed up to look for disappearance of veins, healing of ulcers and eczema, and any complications.
RESULTS: Patients showed a good response to treatment with sclerotherapy. 70-80% of patients showed symptomatic improvement along with disappearance of veins and healing of eczema and ulcers. Most of the complications were minor, which resolved over a period of few weeks.
CONCLUSION: Sclerotherapy is a simple, safe and effective procedure for the treatment of varicose veins and its dermatological complications. The procedure is particularly effective for smaller, early varicosities and also for residual veins after surgery. Hence we recommend more and more of our fellow dermatologists to take up this procedure, which can be an efficient tool to manage patients with varicose veins and its related complications.","['Subbarao NT', 'Aradhya SS', 'Veerabhadrappa NH']",2013,79,3,Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol,"Subbarao NT, et al.

The target audience for this guideline is health care professionals who specialize in, direct, or provide wound care for patients at risk for or with lower-extremity venous disease. The full guideline opens with an overview of definitions of LEVD, its prevalence, clinical relevance, etiology, related physiology and pathophysiology, and overall management goals for patients at risk for developing venous leg ulcers. A detailed assessment section describes how to conduct a full clinical history and physical examination. Two approaches to interventions are provided: one addresses prevention strategies to reduce the risk of developing LEVD with ulcers. Methods to prevent ulcer recurrence are summarized including compression therapy, adjunctive therapies, medications, and patient education. A second approach presents treatment interventions including wound cleansing, debridement, infection control, antibiotic use, along with management of the periwound skin, nutrition, pain, and edema. This section also discusses limb elevation, surgical options, adjunctive therapies, patient education, and health care provider follow-up. A comprehensive reference list, glossary of terms, and appendices on cellulitis and venous eczema, types of edema, and compression therapy are available at the end of the guideline.

22312063,The relevance of the natural history of varicose veins and refunded care.,"Chronic venous disease (CVD) is one of the most common diseases in our population. Aside from venous symptoms like heaviness and pain, which are present in about 50% of the general population, signs of CVD include varicose veins (VVs), oedema, eczema, venous eczema, hyperpigmentation, white atrophy, lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulcers. The aim of this paper is to review current literature for the relevance of natural history of VVs in refunded care. Available papers on VVs, progression of the disease and complications were reviewed. Prevalence of VVs is high with more than 20% in the general population. Information on progression of uncomplicated VV to chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is rare. However, most venous ulcers have a primary venous origin. The progression rate of VV to higher clinical stages reaches 4% per year. Among the risk factors are obesity and higher age. Quality of life (QOL) is also reduced in uncomplicated VV in C2 patients. In conclusion, there is evidence from the literature that a high proportion of patients with uncomplicated VVs in the clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathophysiological classification (CEAP Clinical Class 2) will progress to CVI if untreated. VVs have a negative impact on QOL and clinical symptoms. VV patients with CVI (C3-C6) as well as those C2 patients with severe clinical symptoms and impaired QOL due to CVD should be treated with ablation of the VVs in a refunded care system.","['Pannier F', 'Rabe E']",2012,27 Suppl 1,,Phlebology,Pannier F and Rabe E.

A status paper.","Plant-derived elements used for pharmacological applications constitute an increasing research field. Centella asiatica is widely used mainly as an extract (TECA). Triterpenic fractions, the primary constituents of Centella asiatica, produce a wide range of preventive and therapeutic effects. The modulation of collagen production and deposition in wound healing is of primary importance. TECA is also used to treat several microcirculatory problems, inflammatory skin conditions (leprosy, lupus, varicose ulcers, eczema, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis) and also intestinal problems, fever, amenorrhea and genitourinary conditions. Cognitive functions, anxiety and mental impairment may be also affected by TECA administration. New applications in neurology include nerve growth factor enhancement and applications in neurological degenerative conditions. Interaction with other products is also indicated in this document. The multiplicity of actions of TECA is associated to six important mechanisms, all inter-connected and modulating each other: 1) edema - and capillary filtration - control; 2) a strong antioxidant power, effective on several forms of oxidative stress associated to inflammation or infections and synergic with other antioxidant products; 3) an anti-inflammatory action; 4) a modulation of the collagen production avoiding slower scarring or faster, hyperthrophic scarring and cheloids; 5) a modulating action of local growth factors; 6) a modulation of angiogenesis. This ""status"" paper - resulting from an expert meeting held in Cobham, Surrey, indicates most of the therapeutic potential of TECA, still to be explored in further studies. The status paper constitutes the basis for a consensus document on TECA to be developed in the next future.

21895625,Misdiagnosis and delay in referral of children with localized scleroderma.,"BACKGROUND: Localized scleroderma (LS) usually begins in childhood with a broad clinical spectrum and the diagnosis is often delayed.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diagnostic pathway in a large cohort of paediatric patients with LS, to identify the duration until correct diagnosis and to characterize clinical clues for early diagnosis.
METHODS: A retrospective case note review of 50 children with LS.
RESULTS: The median (range) age at disease onset was 5·2 (0·1-14·4) years and disease duration until diagnosis 11·1 (1·8-79) months. The patients were first seen by a general practitioner (or paediatrician) after 1·2 (0·2-48·7) months and in none of the cases was the condition recognized at presentation according to a parental questionnaire (no diagnosis in 44%, misdiagnosis of atopic eczema 20%, melanocytic naevus 8%, fungal infection 6%, bruise 4%, varicose vein 4%, bacterial infection 4% and others). The patients were referred to a local specialist (dermatologist in 72%) after a disease duration of 7·5 (1·0-70·9) months and in 64% the correct diagnosis was established. In 20% the diagnosis remained unknown, 8% were misdiagnosed as port-wine stains and others as atopic eczema and melanocytic naevus. The correct diagnosis was eventually identified by the referring dermatologists, the paediatric dermatologists at our hospital, external maxillofacial surgeons and a paediatrician in 29 (58%), 17 (34%), 3 (6%) and 1 (2%), respectively. Histology was performed in 15 (30%). The patients were commenced on appropriate treatment after a disease duration of 16·6 (1·8-113·4) months. The main clinical diagnostic clues were: Blaschko-linear distribution 76%, atrophic changes 68%, skin fibrosis 40% and loss of scalp hair or eyelashes 36%.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians involved in the care of these children need to be aware of the characteristic clinical appearance of LS for early recognition and prompt initiation of treatment.","['Weibel L', 'Laguda B', 'Atherton D', 'Harper JI']",2011,165,6,Br J Dermatol,"Weibel L, et al.

21413949,Venous ulcer: clinical characteristics and risk factors.,"BACKGROUND: Lower limb venous ulceration ranks among the 10 most common medical problems in Western countries and has significant socioeconomic impact. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for unhealed, recurrent, and large ulcers and to characterize patients with active or recently healed venous ulcers.
METHODS: We identified 97 patients and assessed 103 ulcerated limbs in 90 patients. All patients underwent clinical examination, arterial and venous system evaluation, ankle-brachial index determination, and ultrasound of the affected limb. Clinical characteristics included age, gender, race, ulcer duration, time since first episode, history of recurrence, localization of ulcer, ulcer area, eczema, ochre dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, pain, body mass index, and medical history data. Risk factors were identified by univariate analysis and estimated odds ratios.
RESULTS: We assessed 90 patients (103 limbs) with active or healed venous leg ulcers, of whom 84.4% were Caucasian and 68.9% were female. Mean age was 56.0 ± 13.3 years. Ulcers had remained unhealed for <1 year in 40.7%. Lipodermatosclerosis, lower limb hyperpigmentation, edema, and eczema were seen in 96.7%, 95.6%, 94.4%, and 51.1% of patients, respectively. Pain was a frequent symptom in 74.4%. Body mass index was assessed in 85 patients: 30.6% were slightly, 36.5% moderately, and 7% severely obese. Patient age >60 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.0), extensive lipodermatosclerosis (OR 8.7), and previous history of ulceration (OR 19.9) were risk factors for unhealed ulcers. Time since first ulcer episode ≥ 2 years (OR 29.2) and incompetence of venous systems (OR 1.6) were risk factors for recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Longstanding and large ulcers and recurrences are the main problems encountered by venous ulcer patients. Severe lipodermatosclerosis, previous ulcer history, and time since first ulcer episode ≥ 2 years are significant risk factors.","['Abbade LP', 'Lastória S', 'Rollo Hde A']",2011,50,4,Int J Dermatol,"Abbade LP, et al.

23074413,Endovascular radiofrequency ablation for varicose veins: an evidence-based analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the MAS evidence review was to conduct a systematic review of the available evidence on the safety, effectiveness, durability and cost-effectiveness of endovascular radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of primary symptomatic varicose veins.
BACKGROUND: The Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) met on August 26th, 2010 to review the safety, effectiveness, durability, and cost-effectiveness of RFA for the treatment of primary symptomatic varicose veins based on an evidence-based review by the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS). CLINICAL CONDITION: Varicose veins (VV) are tortuous, twisted, or elongated veins. This can be due to existing (inherited) valve dysfunction or decreased vein elasticity (primary venous reflux) or valve damage from prior thrombotic events (secondary venous reflux). The end result is pooling of blood in the veins, increased venous pressure and subsequent vein enlargement. As a result of high venous pressure, branch vessels balloon out leading to varicosities (varicose veins). SYMPTOMS TYPICALLY AFFECT THE LOWER EXTREMITIES AND INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO): aching, swelling, throbbing, night cramps, restless legs, leg fatigue, itching and burning. Left untreated, venous reflux tends to be progressive, often leading to chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). A number of complications are associated with untreated venous reflux: including superficial thrombophlebitis as well as variceal rupture and haemorrhage. CVI often results in chronic skin changes referred to as stasis dermatitis. Stasis dermatitis is comprised of a spectrum of cutaneous abnormalities including edema, hyperpigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis and stasis ulceration. Ulceration represents the disease end point for severe CVI. CVI is associated with a reduced quality of life particularly in relation to pain, physical function and mobility. In severe cases, VV with ulcers, QOL has been rated to be as bad or worse as other chronic diseases such as back pain and arthritis. Lower limb VV is a very common disease affecting adults - estimated to be the 7th most common reason for physician referral in the US. There is a very strong familial predisposition to VV. The risk in offspring is 90% if both parents affected, 20% when neither affected and 45% (25% boys, 62% girls) if one parent affected. The prevalence of VV worldwide ranges from 5% to 15% among men and 3% to 29% among women varying by the age, gender and ethnicity of the study population, survey methods and disease definition and measurement. The annual incidence of VV estimated from the Framingham Study was reported to be 2.6% among women and 1.9% among men and did not vary within the age range (40-89 years) studied. Approximately 1% of the adult population has a stasis ulcer of venous origin at any one time with 4% at risk. The majority of leg ulcer patients are elderly with simple superficial vein reflux. Stasis ulcers are often lengthy medical problems and can last for several years and, despite effective compression therapy and multilayer bandaging are associated with high recurrence rates. Recent trials involving surgical treatment of superficial vein reflux have resulted in healing and significantly reduced recurrence rates. ENDOVASCULAR RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION FOR VARICOSE VEINS: RFA is an image-guided minimally invasive treatment alternative to surgical stripping of superficial venous reflux. RFA does not require an operating room or general anaesthesia and has been performed in an outpatient setting by a variety of medical specialties including surgeons and interventional radiologists. Rather than surgically removing the vein, RFA works by destroying or ablating the refluxing vein segment using thermal energy delivered through a radiofrequency catheter. Prior to performing RFA, color-flow Doppler ultrasonography is used to confirm and map all areas of venous reflux to devise a safe and effective treatment plan. The RFA procedure involves the introduction of a guide wire into the target vein under ultrasound guidance followed by the insertion of an introducer sheath through which the RFA catheter is advanced. Once satisfactory positioning has been confirmed with ultrasound, a tumescent anaesthetic solution is injected into the soft tissue surrounding the target vein along its entire length. This serves to anaesthetize the vein, insulate the heat from damaging adjacent structures, including nerves and skin and compresses the vein increasing optimal contact of the vessel wall with the electrodes or expanded prongs of the RF device. The RF generator is then activated and the catheter is slowly pulled along the length of the vein. At the end of the procedure, hemostasis is then achieved by applying pressure to the vein entry point. Adequate and proper compression stockings and bandages are applied after the procedure to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and to reduce postoperative bruising and tenderness. Patients are encouraged to walk immediately after the procedure. Follow-up protocols vary, with most patients returning 1 to 3 weeks later for an initial follow-up visit. At this point, the initial clinical result is assessed and occlusion of the treated vessels is confirmed with ultrasound. Patients often have a second follow-up visit 1 to 3 months following RFA at which time clinical evaluation and ultrasound are repeated. If required, additional procedures such as phlebectomy or sclerotherapy may be performed during the RFA procedure or at any follow-up visits.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: THE MAS EVIDENCE SEARCH ON THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ENDOVASCULAR RFA ABLATION OF VV IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING EVIDENCE: three HTAs, nine systematic reviews, eight randomized controlled trials (five comparing RFA to surgery and three comparing RFA to ELT), five controlled clinical trials and fourteen cohort case series (four were multicenter registry studies). The majority (12⁄14) of the cohort studies (3,664) evaluating RFA for VV involved treatment with first generation RFA catheters and the great saphenous vein (GSV) was the target vessel in all studies. Major adverse events were uncommonly reported and the overall pooled major adverse event rate extracted from the cohort studies was 2.9% (105⁄3,664). Imaging defined treatment effectiveness of vein closure rates were variable ranging from 68% to 96% at post-operative follow-up. Vein ablation rate at 6-month follow-up was reported in four studies with rates close to 90%. Only one study reported vein closure rates at 2 years but only for a minority of the eligible cases. The two studies reporting on RFA ablation with the more efficient second generation catheters involved better follow-up and reported higher ablation rates close to 100% at 6-month follow-up with no major adverse events. A large prospective registry trial that recruited over 1,000 patients at thirty-four largely European centers reported on treatment success in six overlapping reports on selected patient subgroups at various follow-up points up to 5 year. However, the follow-up for eligible recruited patients at all time points was low resulting in inadequate estimates of longer term treatment efficacy. The overall level of evidence of randomized trials comparing RFA with surgical ligation and vein stripping (n = 5) was graded as low to moderate. In all trials RFA ablation was performed with first generation catheters in the setting of the operating theatre under general anaesthesia, usually without tumescent anaesthesia. Procedure times were significantly longer after RFA than surgery. Recovery after treatment was significantly quicker after RFA both with return to usual activity and return to work with on average a one week less of work loss. Major adverse events occurring after surgery were higher [(1.8% (n=4) vs. 0.4% (n = 1) than after RFA but not significantly. Treatment effectiveness measured by imaging defined vein absence or vein closure was comparable in the two treatment groups. Significant improvements in vein symptoms and quality of life over baseline were reported for both treatment groups.

22557433,Effect of taleeq (leech therapy) in dawali (varicose veins).,"Dawali (varicose vein) is first described in Ebers Papyrus over 3500 years ago. Dawali is a disease in which veins of legs and feet become dilated, tortuous, and greenish in colour due to excess accumulation of blood which is derived from saudavi madda & balgham ghaleez. The aetiology of varicose veins is still incompletely under stood, despite the fact that it is a very common disease affecting all ages from teenagers to elderly people. The complication of varicose veins like venous eczema, venous pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, superficial thrombophlebitis, venous ulceration, etc impair health related quality of life significantly. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Taleeq in Dawali and to provide safe & cost effective alternative treatment. Randomized controlled clinical open trial was conducted in regimenal unit of NIUM Hospital. 50 patients were divided into 2 groups, 30 in test & 20 in control group. Test group was treated with Taleeq on alternate day & control group was treated with grade 2 compression stockings & limb elevation for 2 months. Response was measured by assessment of pain / leg discomfort, limb girth at calf, ankle, and feet, pigmentation area & colour on every 15(th) day. Hb% was assessed on every 15(th) day to check anaemia. Effect on anatomy of vein was assessed by colour flow Doppler USG. Test group showed significant reduction in pain, limb girth, pigmentation, number of perforators. Control group showed significant reduction in pain & limb girth, but there was no improvement on pigmentation. Both groups do not show significant improvement on SFJ & SPJ incompetency. Test group has major effects in improvement of all parameters. Study stresses that leech therapy should be administered in combination with compression stockings & other effective treatment modalities like weight normalization for obese patients, physical therapy, dietary modification etc for optimal results.","['Nigar Z', 'Alam MA']",2011,30,3,Anc Sci Life,Nigar Z and Alam MA.

21078130,Cushing's syndrome and chronic venous ulceration--a clinical challenge.,"Cushing's syndrome is a condition caused by high levels of glucocorticoids, or most commonly as a result of prolonged exposure to exogenous steroids. Clinical features include diabetes, hypertension, obesity, skin atrophy, immune suppression and delayed wound healing. We report a patient with iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, in whom long-term topical steroid therapy was used to treat varicose eczema, which contributed to the development of type 2 diabetes, morbid obesity, sleep apnoea and chronic wound sepsis. In this case, repeated hospital admissions and systemic antibiotics were associated with considerable comorbidity. Aggressive local treatment, consisting of potassium permanganate soaks and irrigating gels, was highly effective in reducing the amount of exudate, pain and preventing from further deterioration of the patient's legs.","['Biswas M', 'Gibby O', 'Ivanova-Stoilova T', 'Harding K']",2011,8,1,Int Wound J,"Biswas M, et al.

20554008,An acidic glycoconjugate from Lythrum salicaria L. with controversial effects on haemostasis.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: Lythrum salicaria L. belongs to the small Lythraceae family of 22 genera, which range in habit from herbs to shrubs and trees found with worldwide distribution (Heywood, 1993). The generic name of Lythrum derived from Greek ""luthron""--blood, possibly referring to the color of the flowers or to the one of its herbal use as an astringent to stop bleeding (Thompson et al., 1987; Mountain, 1994; Pawlaczyk and Pacula, 2002). The flowering parts and the flowering branch tips are used in traditional medicine and pharmaceuticals internally in a form of decoctions or as extracts for treatment of diarrhea, chronic intestinal catarrhs, hemorrhoids and eczema, or externally to treat varicose veins, venous insufficiency and gums (Mantle et al., 2000; Rauha et al., 2000). The aim of this study was to isolate the plant glycoconjugate from flowering parts of Lythrum salicaria, and to verify its influence on blood coagulation process.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the air-dried flowering parts of this plant a water-soluble glycoconjugate has been isolated by hot alkaline extraction followed by neutralization and purification by multi-steps extraction with organic solvents, dialysis and concentration. The plant isolate was tested in vitro on anticoagulant activity on human plasma, and on Wistar rats blood system in vivo as well as ex vivo.
RESULTS: A dark brown isolate was obtained in the yield of 8% of starting material (w/w) as a macromolecular compound with M(w) approximately 12,500. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of carbohydrates (30%), phenolics (1g contained 1.2mM of gallic acid equivalent) and proteins (0.8%). The result of compositional analyses of carbohydrate part revealed the predominance of uronic acids (approximately 66%), galactose (approximately 12%), rhamnose (approximately 10%) and arabinose (approximately 9%) residues indicating thus the presence of pectic type of polymers, i.e. galacturonan and/or rhamnogalacturonan associated with arabinogalactan in Lythrum glycoconjugate. In vitro and ex vivo experiments showed complete inhibition of plasma clot formation, however, the application of Lythrum glycoconjugate in vivo showed controversial effect on animal blood system in comparison with in vitro ones, i.e. pro-coagulant activity.
CONCLUSION: The in vivo results give a scientific explanation for the traditional use of Lythrum salicaria as a styptic agent. It seems that pro-coagulant activity of this complex could be probably connected with the other factors in blood circulation system, like platelets.","['Pawlaczyk I', 'Czerchawski L', 'Kańska J', 'Bijak J', 'Capek P', 'Pliszczak-Król A', 'Gancarz R']",2010,131,1,J Ethnopharmacol,"Pawlaczyk I, et al.

20470915,[Heart failure and stasis ulcer: A significant association (prospective study of 100 cases)].,"BACKGROUND: Risk factors for stasis ulcers have been poorly studied. We conducted a three-year controlled prospective study of the usual risk factors [venous insufficiency (VI), obesity, phlebitis] and of other factors suggested by our experience, such as heart failure (HF).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Both in-patients and out-patients referred for stasis ulcers were included. The diagnosis of stasis ulcer was based on clinical criteria: venous insufficiency, cutaneous signs and/or severe leg oedema. Doppler ultrasound was performed systematically if the lesions showed no dramatic improvement within two months of treatment to eliminate arterial ulcers. VI, liver cirrhosis, heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, obesity, after-effects of leg injury, homolateral artificial hip and knee joints, and consumption of anti-leukaemia or leg-oedema-eliciting drugs were the criteria analysed by clinical examination or by consulting the information in the hospital records. Data were analyzed using SPSS/PCv12 software. Chi(2) and Fischer's exact tests were to compare cases and controls, who were identical in age, gender, and department of initial contact for reasons other than leg ulcers, stasis eczema or lipodermatosclerosis.
RESULTS: We included 100 cases and 200 control subjects. Most were out-patients and only 4% were hospitalized in cardiology. Univariate analysis showed that stasis ulcer was significantly associated (p < 10(-4)) with VI (71% of cases versus 32.5% of control subjects), HF (44% versus 11%), obesity (44% versus 21.5%), after-effects of injury (17% versus 0%), and to a lesser extent, with artificial knee joints (7% versus 2.5%; p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis showed that stasis ulcer was strongly associated with VI (OR=5.5; 3-9.9) and HF (OR=4.7; 2.1-10.4). HF (right 16%, left 11%, global 57%, unspecified 16%) was also significantly associated with bilateral localization of leg ulcers (p = 10(-4)) but not with delayed healing (> 6 months).
DISCUSSION: This study highlights two risk factors for stasis ulcer: artificial knee joints (in the univariate analysis only) and HF. An increase in leg oedemas is probably an important mechanism but we suggest the role of hypoxaemia in patients with isolated left HF. We advise an internist approach in the management of venous leg ulcers, which we prefer to name stasis ulcers, before having ruled out a general disease. In particular, we recommend a consultation with a cardiologist in the event of doubt.","['Augey F', 'Pinet A', 'Renaudier P']",2010,137,5,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Augey F, et al.

23074409,Endovascular laser therapy for varicose veins: an evidence-based analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the MAS evidence review was to conduct a systematic review of the available evidence on the safety, effectiveness, durability and cost-effectiveness of endovascular laser therapy (ELT) for the treatment of primary symptomatic varicose veins (VV).
BACKGROUND: The Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) met on November 27, 2009 to review the safety, effectiveness, durability and cost-effectiveness of ELT for the treatment of primary VV based on an evidence-based review by the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS). CLINICAL CONDITION: VV are tortuous, twisted, or elongated veins. This can be due to existing (inherited) valve dysfunction or decreased vein elasticity (primary venous reflux) or valve damage from prior thrombotic events (secondary venous reflux). The end result is pooling of blood in the veins, increased venous pressure and subsequent vein enlargement. As a result of high venous pressure, branch vessels balloon out leading to varicosities (varicose veins). SYMPTOMS TYPICALLY AFFECT THE LOWER EXTREMITIES AND INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO): aching, swelling, throbbing, night cramps, restless legs, leg fatigue, itching and burning. Left untreated, venous reflux tends to be progressive, often leading to chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). A NUMBER OF COMPLICATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH UNTREATED VENOUS REFLUX: including superficial thrombophlebitis as well as variceal rupture and haemorrhage. CVI often results in chronic skin changes referred to as stasis dermatitis. Stasis dermatitis is comprised of a spectrum of cutaneous abnormalities including edema, hyperpigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis and stasis ulceration. Ulceration represents the disease end point for severe CVI. CVI is associated with a reduced quality of life particularly in relation to pain, physical function and mobility. In severe cases, VV with ulcers, QOL has been rated to be as bad or worse as other chronic diseases such as back pain and arthritis. Lower limb VV is a common disease affecting adults and estimated to be the seventh most common reason for physician referral in the US. There is a strong familial predisposition to VV with the risk in offspring being 90% if both parents affected, 20% when neither is affected, and 45% (25% boys, 62% girls) if one parent is affected. Globally, the prevalence of VV ranges from 5% to 15% among men and 3% to 29% among women varying by the age, gender and ethnicity of the study population, survey methods and disease definition and measurement. The annual incidence of VV estimated from the Framingham Study was reported to be 2.6% among women and 1.9% among men and did not vary within the age range (40-89 years) studied. Approximately 1% of the adult population has a stasis ulcer of venous origin at any one time with 4% at risk. The majority of leg ulcer patients are elderly with simple superficial vein reflux. Stasis ulcers are often lengthy medical problems and can last for several years and, despite effective compression therapy and multilayer bandaging are associated with high recurrence rates. Recent trials involving surgical treatment of superficial vein reflux have resulted in healing and significantly reduced recurrence rates. ENDOVASCULAR LASER THERAPY FOR VV: ELT is an image-guided, minimally invasive treatment alternative to surgical stripping of superficial venous reflux. It does not require an operating room or general anesthesia and has been performed in outpatient settings by a variety of medical specialties including surgeons (vascular or general), interventional radiologists and phlebologists. Rather than surgically removing the vein, ELT works by destroying, cauterizing or ablating the refluxing vein segment using heat energy delivered via laser fibre. Prior to ELT, colour-flow Doppler ultrasonography is used to confirm and map all areas of venous reflux to devise a safe and effective treatment plan. The ELT procedure involves the introduction of a guide wire into the target vein under ultrasound guidance followed by the insertion of an introducer sheath through which an optical fibre carrying the laser energy is advanced. A tumescent anesthetic solution is injected into the soft tissue surrounding the target vein along its entire length. This serves to anaesthetize the vein so that the patient feels no discomfort during the procedure. It also serves to insulate the heat from damaging adjacent structures, including nerves and skin. Once satisfactory positioning has been confirmed with ultrasound, the laser is activated. Both the laser fibre and the sheath are simultaneously, slowly and continuously pulled back along the length of the target vessel. At the end of the procedure, homeostasis is then achieved by applying pressure to the entry point. Adequate and proper compression stockings and bandages are applied after the procedure to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism, and to reduce postoperative bruising and tenderness. Patients are encouraged to walk immediately after the procedure and most patients return to work or usual activity within a few days. Follow-up protocols vary, with most patients returning 1-3 weeks later for an initial follow-up visit. At this point, the initial clinical result is assessed and occlusion of the treated vessels is confirmed with ultrasound. Patients often have a second follow-up visit 1-3 months following ELT at which time clinical evaluation and ultrasound are repeated. If required, sclerotherapy may be performed during the ELT procedure or at any follow-up visits.
REGULATORY STATUS: Endovascular laser for the treatment of VV was approved by Health Canada as a class 3 device in 2002. The treatment has been an insured service in Saskatchewan since 2007 and is the only province to insure ELT. Although the treatment is not an insured service in Ontario, it has been provided by various medical specialties since 2002 in over 20 private clinics.
LITERATURE SEARCH: The MAS evidence-based review was performed as an update to the 2007 health technology review performed by the Australian Medical Services Committee (MSAC) to support public financing decisions. The literature search was performed on August 18, 2009 using standard bibliographic databases for studies published from January 1, 2007 to August 15, 2009. Search alerts were generated and reviewed for additional relevant literature up until October 1, 2009.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: English language full-reports and human studiesOriginal reports with defined study methodologyReports including standardized measurements on outcome events such as technical success, safety, effectiveness, durability, quality of life or patient satisfactionReports involving ELT for VV (great or small saphenous veins)Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analysesCohort and controlled clinical studies involving > 1 month ultrasound imaging follow-up

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The MAS evidence search identified 14 systematic reviews, 29 cohort studies on safety and effectiveness, four cost studies and 12 randomized controlled trials involving ELT, six of these comparing endovascular laser with surgical ligation and saphenous vein stripping. Since 2007, 22 cohort studies involving 10,883 patients undergoing ELT of the great saphenous vein (GSV) have been published. Imaging defined treatment effectiveness of mean vein closure rates were reported to be greater than 90% (range 93%- 99%) at short term follow-up. Longer than one year follow-up was reported in five studies with life table analysis performed in four but the follow up was still limited at three and four years. The overall pooled major adverse event rate, including DVT, PE, skin burns or nerve damage events extracted from these studies, was 0.63% (69/10,883). The overall level of evidence of randomized trials comparing ELT with surgical ligation and vein stripping (n= 6) was graded as moderate to high. Recovery after treatment was significantly quicker after ELT (return to work median number of days, 4 vs. 17; p= .005). Major adverse events occurring after surgery were higher [(1.8% (n=4) vs. 0.4% (n = 1) 1 but not significantly. Treatment effectiveness as measured by imaging vein absence or closure, symptom relief or quality of life similar in the two treatment groups and both treatments resulted in statistically significantly improvements in these outcomes. Recurrence was low after both treatments at follow up but neovascularization (growth of new vessels, a key predictor of long term recurrence was significantly more common (18% vs. 1%; p = .001) after surgery. Although patient satisfaction was reported to be high (>80%) with both treatments, patient preferences evaluated through recruitment process, physician reports and consumer groups were strongly in favour of ELT. For patients minimal complications, quick recovery and dependability of outpatient scheduling were key considerations. As clinical effectiveness of the two treatments was similar, a cost-analysis was performed to compare differences in resources and costs between the two procedures. A budget impact analysis for introducing ELT as an insured service was also performed. The average case cost (based on Ontario hospital costs and medical resources) for surgical vein stripping was estimated to be $1,799. Because of the uncertainties with resources associated with ELT, in addition to the device related costs, hospital costs were varied and assumed to be the same as or less than (40%) those for surgery resulting in an average ELT case cost of $2,025 or $1,602.

19497512,Risk factors for chronic ulceration in patients with varicose veins: a case control study.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Identifying which patients with varicose veins are at risk of progressing to more severe forms of chronic venous disease could help in assigning clinical priorities and targeting appropriate treatments. The aim of this study was to determine, in subjects with varicose veins, the characteristics of venous disease and other factors associated with an increased risk of ulceration.
METHODS: One hundred twenty subjects with varicose veins and an open or healed venous leg ulcer were compared with 120 controls with varicose veins and no history of venous ulcer on this case control study. Subjects were recruited from hospital settings and primary care. Each subject completed a questionnaire on lifestyle and medical history and underwent an examination comprising of clinical classification of venous disease (CEAP), duplex scanning, quantitative digital photoplethysmography, and measurement of dorsiflexion. Multiple logistic regression analyses and calculation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to identify the combination of factors which most accurately predicted which patients with varicose veins will develop leg ulcers.
RESULTS: An increased risk of ulceration was associated with the severity of clinical venous disease, especially with the presence of skin changes (P < .0001). Other significant risk factors included history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (P = .001), higher body mass index (BMI) (P = .006), smoking (P = .009), and reflux in the deep veins (P = .0001). Ulceration was associated with reduced volume of blood displaced as reflected by photoplethysmography and a limited range of ankle movement (not wholly due to the effects of an active ulcer) (both P < .05). Multivariate analyses showed that skin changes including lipodermatosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] 8.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-54.8), corona phlebectatica (OR 4.52, 95% CI 1.81-11.3) and eczema (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.12-7.07), higher BMI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15), and popliteal vein reflux (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.03-7.75) remained independently associated with increased risk of ulceration while good dorsiflexion of the ankle (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.97) and an effective calf muscle pump (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99) remained protective factors. ROC curve analyses indicated that a model based on clinical observation of skin changes, duplex scanning for popliteal reflux, and calf muscle pump tests would be the most accurate in determining which patients with varicose veins develop leg ulcers.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm that, in patients with varicose veins, those with skin changes of chronic venous insufficiency and deep vein incompetence are at greatly increased risk of ulceration. However, the risks may also be increased in those who smoke, are obese, and have restricted ankle movement and reduced calf muscle pump power.","['Robertson L', 'Lee AJ', 'Gallagher K', 'Carmichael SJ', 'Evans CJ', 'McKinstry BH', 'Fraser SC', 'Allan PL', 'Weller D', 'Ruckley CV', 'Fowkes FG']",2009,49,6,J Vasc Surg,"Robertson L, et al.

19293499,Contact sensitization in venous eczema: preliminary results of patch testing with Indian standard series and topical medicaments.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Elimination of allergens/topical medications causing contact dermatitis in venous eczema, which poses a significant problem in its chronicity and treatment, provides the basis for better therapeutic outcome. Our objective was to determine the pattern of contact sensitization in venous eczema patients in Himachal Pradesh (India).
METHODS: Thirty-four patients (M:F, 31:3) and 10 controls (M:F, 6:4) were patch tested with Indian standard series and 10 commonly used topical medicaments.
RESULTS: Positive patch test results were seen in 50% (M:F, 16:1) of the patients. Common allergens were Fragrance mix (15%), p-phenylendiamine (15%), nickel (9%), wool alcohol (9%), chinoform (9%), balsum of Peru (5%), cobalt chloride (5%), potassium dichromate (3%), epoxy resin (3%), thiuram mix (3%) and formaldehyde (3%). Only sisomycin and miconazole among the topical medications elicited a positive patch test reaction in 3 and 5% patients, respectively. Neomycin contact sensitivity was not seen in any of the patients. One patient who had exacerbation of venous eczema following accidental application of topical diclofenac showed a positive patch test reaction to it.
CONCLUSIONS: Patch test should be used to identify the topical agents that may be responsible for perpetuation or aggravation of eczema, especially in patients who do not improve despite adequate treatment of other underlying cause(s).","['Jindal R', 'Sharma NL', 'Mahajan VK', 'Tegta GR']",2009,75,2,Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol,"Jindal R, et al.

19248688,Classical varicose vein surgery in a diverse ethnic community.,"Chronic venous disorders range from telangiactasia or spider veins to varicose veins, venous swellings, skin changes and venous ulcerations. The aim of this study is to assess outcome of varicose vein surgery in the ethnically diverse population of Penang, Malaysia. This study is a retrospective analysis of patients seen from 1999 to 2004. All patients who presented to the outpatient clinic of our surgical department with saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) and/or saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) reflux associated with incompetence of the great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV) respectively underwent classical varicose varicose vein surgery. A single surgeon at a single institution performed the surgeries. Data from pre-operative, post-operative and follow-up procedures were recorded in case report forms. A total of 202 cases were treated. Of these, 200 were qualified by the inclusion criteria and follow-ups, with 23 who were treated bilaterally. Of those treated, Chinese comprised 47.5%, Indians 27.0%, Malays 12.5% and foreigners 13.0% (largely Indonesian Chinese, British and Americans). The average age was 52.1 years. Indians had the highest average BMI of 29.2, compared to the Chinese who had the lowest of 24.6. Based on occupation, housewives (43.0%), blue collar workers (19.0%), salespersons (12.0%) and factory workers (9.5%) were among those afflicted with varicose veins. While local Chinese predominated in the business groups (salespersons and food-related workers), the Indians and Malays in this study were mainly factory workers and/or blue collar workers. Symptomatology in descending order of severity included pain in 80.0% of cases, swelling in 65.5%, heaviness in 53.5%, cramps in 53.0%, lipodermatosclerosis in 39.0%, superficial thrombophlebitis in 33.5%, venous ulceration in 32.0%, eczema 22.0% and cellulitis in 12.5% of patients. Post surgery pains dropped to 9.9%, cramps 6.4%, heaviness 5.5% and swelling 5.3% (p<0.0001 in all groups). Indians had the highest rate of venous ulcers (35.2% of all Indians treated) possibly due to their high BMI and low socioeconomic background. In cases of venous ulcers, gram negative infections (49.8%) were more common than gram positive infections at 18.8%. Operative procedures performed included great saphenous vein high ligation in 96.5% of cases, stripping 93.5% and multiple avulsions in 98.5%, saphenous popliteal junction ligation with multiple avulsions in 13.0% and subfascial ligation in 10.5%. Operative complications included induration (40.0% of cases), bruising in 49.5%, pains in 15.0%, paraesthesia in 3.5%, wound infection in 4.0%, deep venous thrombosis in 3.0% and ulcer recurrence in 7.5%. A total of 96.2% of patients treated expressed satisfaction with varicose vein surgery. Late presentations of chronic venous insufficiency, possibly as a result of poor understanding and inadequate education on diet, weight control, use of stockings and change in lifestyle by patients, employers and general practitioners are probably the cause of high rates of severe chronic venous disease especially venous ulcerations in the local community. However, classical varicose vein surgery is widely applicable across diverse ethnicities with a high rate of success.","['Murli NL', 'Navin ID']",2008,63,3,Med J Malaysia,Murli NL and Navin ID.

19213228,Stasis dermatitis as a complication of amlodipine therapy.,"BACKGROUND: Lower leg edema is a common side effect of amlodipine therapy, but is often unrecognized as a contributor to stasis dermatitis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether amlodipine therapy is more common among patients with stasis dermatitis than age-matched controls.
METHODS: In this retrospective chart review study, the medication lists of all subjects with stasis dermatitis from a single practice site over the past 2 years were compared to alphabetically consecutive charts of patients with basal cell carcinoma to determine the relative usage of amlodipine.
RESULTS: Patients with stasis dermatitis (n=43) are more likely to take amlodipine than are basal cell carcinoma patients (n=117) of similar age (19% vs. 5%, P<.02), even when controlled for the use of any antihypertensive medications (25% vs. 10%, P=.05).
CONCLUSION: Amlodipine therapy is associated with stasis dermatitis and discontinuing amlodipine should be considered when stasis dermatitis is diagnosed.","['Gosnell AL', 'Nedorost ST']",2009,8,2,J Drugs Dermatol,Gosnell AL and Nedorost ST.

Management of this condition may depend on the background of the professional who carries out the initial assessment. Those with a tissue viability background may plan their care based on an assessment of the patient for suitability for compression, to reverse the venous hypertension which may be a causative factor of the eczema. On the other hand, professionals with a background in dermatology may base initial care plans on the use of emollients and topical steroids to reduce inflammation.

16630336,Do teachers have more health problems? Results from a French cross-sectional survey.,"BACKGROUND: Although only a few studies have been published on teachers' health, certain ideas are widely accepted, such as for example, the preconceived notion that teachers suffer from an excessively high rate of mental health problems. The objective of this study is to compare teachers' mental and physical health to that of a control group.
METHODS: A cross-sectional postal survey was conducted among a sample of 3,679 teachers and 1,817 non-teachers aged 20 to 60 years old.
RESULTS: No lifetime prevalence of any psychiatric disorder (with the exception of undifferentiated somatoform disorder in men) or mean scores of psychological distress were found to be significantly higher in teachers. However, multiple analyses, adjusted for all confounding variables, revealed a higher risk of lifetime anxiety disorders in male teachers. On the other hand, significant differences were observed for some physical ailments: a higher lifetime prevalence of rhinopharyngitis/laryngitis in both male and female teachers, of conjunctivitis and lower urinary tract infection in male teachers and of bronchitis, eczema/dermatitis and varicose veins in female teachers. No significant difference was found for chronic pain between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Teachers do not seem to have poorer mental health. However, their physical condition is characterized by a higher prevalence of health problems related to the ENT tract, and to a lesser extent, depending on the gender, to skin, eyes, legs and lower urinary tract.","['Kovess-Masféty V', 'Sevilla-Dedieu C', 'Rios-Seidel C', 'Nerrière E', 'Chan Chee C']",2006,6,,BMC Public Health,"Kovess-Masféty V, et al.

METHOD: This was an open prospective non-comparative multicentre clinical study. Patients were treated for four weeks with Physiotulle -Ag, which was covered by Alione Hydrocapillary Dressing (Coloplast).
RESULTS: Thirty patients were recruited into the study. One ulcer healed after three weeks of treatment. The mean relative ulcer area reduced by 55% after four weeks. Over the study period the mean amount of healthy granulation tissue increased from 26% to 62%, and the mean amount of fibrin decreased from 63% to 32%. The ratio of malodorous wounds was 50% at inclusion, 20% after one week and 3% after four weeks. The dressing was considered easy or very easy to apply in 100% and easy to remove in 89% of dressing evaluations. The dressing combination showed good exudate-management properties. Incidence and severity of maceration, erythema and eczema decreased during the study and no device-related adverse events were recorded.

16490980,Quality control in chronic wound management: the role of local povidone-iodine (Betadine) therapy.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of venous leg ulcers is often inadequate, because of incorrect diagnosis, overuse of systemic antibiotics and inadequate use of compression therapy. Stasis dermatitis related to chronic venous insufficiency accompanied by infected superficial ulcers must be differentiated from erysipelas, cellulitis and contact eczema.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of (1) topical povidone-iodine with and (2) without compression bandages, (3) to compare the efficacy of systemic antibiotics and topical antimicrobial agents to prevent the progression of superficial skin ulcers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 63 patients presenting ulcerated stasis dermatitis due to deep venous refluxes were included in the study. The clinical stage of all patients was homogeneous determined by clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathological classification. They were examined by taking a bacteriological swab from their ulcer area. Compression bandages were used in a total of 42 patients. Twenty-one patients with superficial infected (Staphylococcus aureus) ulcers were treated locally with povidone-iodine (Betadine), and 21 patients were treated with systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin). Twenty-one patients were treated locally with Betadine but did not use compression. The end point was the time of ulcus healing. The healing process of the ulcers was related to the impact of bacterial colonization and clinical signs of infection.
RESULTS: Compression increases the ulcer healing rate compared with no compression. Using the same local povidone-iodine (Betadine) treatment with compression bandages is more effective (82%) for ulcus healing than without compression therapy (62%). The healing rate of ulcers treated with systemic antibiotics was not significantly better (85%) than that of the Betadine group. Using systemic antibiotics, the relapse rate of superficial bacterial infections (impetigo, folliculitis) was significantly higher (32%) than in patients with local disinfection (11%).
CONCLUSION: Compression is essential in the mobilization of the interstitial lymphatic fluid from the region of stasis dermatitis. Topical disinfection and appropriate wound dressings are important to prevent wound infection. Systemic antibiotics are necessary only in systemic infections (fever, lymphangitis, lymphadenopathy, erysipelas).",['Daróczy J'],2006,212 Suppl 1,,Dermatology,Daróczy J.

The patch testing confirmed a pronounced sensitization to the hydrocolloid dressing apart from the sensitization to colophony. After review of the current literature we found several case reports from the last 10 years about sensitization to hydrocolloids which were identical but distributed under different brand names in different countries. These dressings contain the pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin as the tackifying agent which is the substance retaining the sensitizing potential of colophony. Especially patients with chronic wounds frequently tend to contact sensitizations, and colophony currently represents the 4th most frequent allergen in Germany.

15531974,Treatment of severe chronic venous insufficiency using the subfascial endoscopic perforator vein procedure.,"BACKGROUND: Before 1985, corrective surgical procedures for patients with chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulcers were performed using long incisions through diseased skin and subcutaneous tissues. The procedure, involving ligation of incompetent perforator veins, known as ""the Linton operation,"" often was complicated by wound infections and poor healing. This changed in 1985 when G. Hauer demonstrated a new surgical technique for direct visual identification of the incompetent perforator veins using an endoscope in the subfascial space. This seminal contribution marked the advent of subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery (SEPS).
METHODS: From 1996 to 2004, the authors group prospectively collected data on 110 patients with chronic venous insufficiency who underwent a SEPS procedure. Preoperative assessment of the limb's vascular status consisted of color-flow duplex ultrasound imaging and ascending and descending phlebography to locate vein valve incompetence, along with venous mapping. The ages of the patients ranged from 42 to 82 years (mean, 60 years). A total of 128 limbs underwent the SEPS procedure in the cohort of 110 patients. According to CEAP classification for venous limb disease, 60 limbs belonged to group C5 (skin changes, pigmentation, venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, healed ulcer) and 68limbs to group C6 (skin changes and active ulceration).
RESULTS: The 110 patients underwent 128 SEPS procedures without significant morbidity. Of the 68 limbs in class C6, 54 showed ulcer healing within the follow-up period of 12 weeks. The remaining 14 limbs in class C6 achieved ulcer healing within 24 weeks. In this latter group, 10 patients had venous ulcers larger than 4 cm in diameter. These patients underwent a split-thickness skin graft at the time the SEPS procedure was performed. The grafts remained healed during a 2-year follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the SEPS procedure when incorporated into the overall treatment strategy for patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Minimal postoperative complications accompanied by ulcer healing and relief of lower extremity symptoms were achieved for all the patients, underscoring the important role of incompetent perforator veins in the formation of chronic venous insufficiency.","['Baron HC', 'Wayne MG', 'Santiago C', 'Lown I', 'Castellano M', 'Cioroiu M', 'Grossi R']",2005,19,1,Surg Endosc,"Baron HC, et al.

PATIENTS: One hundred and twenty-four patients (156 limbs) operated primarily in standard surgeon-supervised operations, were audited.
METHODS: All patients were questioned via telephone interviews, and those with symptoms or recurrent varicosities were recalled for clinical review and investigations by the surgeon.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven cases presented with lower limb pain, 36 with eczema and 27 with ulcer. Eighty-one percent of operations were performed for symptomatic varicose veins and 19% were done for cosmesis. There were 153 limbs with varicosities, 121 of these had documented long saphenous vein reflux preoperatively. One hundred and sixteen limbs resolved post-operatively, five did not resolve, and four recurred. Incompetent perforators and short saphenous veins were the commonest causes of non-resolution and recurrence. Complications, including five cases of saphenous nerve paraesthesias, were temporary and met with full resolution eventually.

12574811,Body mass index is associated with the development of the post-thrombotic syndrome.,"Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a chronic complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Little is known about prognostic factors that might identify patients at high risk for the development of PTS. Body mass index (BMI) has been previously reported to be associated to the development of PTS. The aim of this study was to assess the association between BMI and other anthropometric parameters and PTS in a general population of DVT patients. In a prospective cohort study, 83 consecutive patients with objective diagnosis of DVT underwent physical examination. BMI was recorded at baseline and at 12 months, and waist circumference was recorded at 12 months to assess individual patterns of body fat distribution. The presence of PTS at 12 months was ascertained using a validated clinical scale. Sixty-three patients (75.9%) were overweight or obese at 12 months, 60 (72.3%) had a weight gain over 1 year. Twenty patients developed PTS (24.1%). Mean BMI was significantly higher in patients who developed PTS than in patients who did not (29.6 and 27.2 Kg/m(2), respectively, p = 0.022). A BMI of > 28 Kg/m(2) predicted early onset of PTS (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.07-12.08, p = 0.017).

12180894,Dermatological care of the diabetic foot.,"Approximately 30% of patients with diabetes mellitus will have disease-related dermatological problems. Dry skin can be associated with autonomic neuropathy and may be fragile, promoting bacterial invasion. Any potentially infected 'diabetic foot' must be taken seriously, and non-painful deep sepsis suspected if there is evidence of sensory loss. Consideration should be given to eliminating nasal carriage of staphylococci if recurrent superficial sepsis occurs in the presence of poor diabetic control. Fungal infections, both of skin and nails, are common but usually not serious in the absence of immunosuppression. Treatment with topical antifungals may need to be combined with systemic therapy for successful eradication. Systemic antifungal therapy should be carefully considered as treatment needs to be prolonged and is potentially toxic, particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus who often have co-morbidities. Varicose eczema should be treated by physical therapies intended to improve venous return and prevent peripheral edema and tissue injury. Allergic dermatitis is commonly associated with topical treatments and other sensitizers. Many reactions are not apparent from history, and patch testing for sensitivity is recommended. There are several diabetes mellitus-specific conditions that dermatologists must be aware of, including, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, granuloma annulare, diabetic dermopathy (spotted leg syndrome or shin spots), diabetic bullae (bullosis diabeticorum), and limited joint mobility and waxy skin syndrome. Ulceration, due to varying combinations of peripheral vascular disease and sensory neuropathy, is the province of the specialist team dealing with the diabetic foot and should ideally be referred to an appropriate multidisciplinary team.","['Aye M', 'Masson EA']",2002,3,7,Am J Clin Dermatol,Aye M and Masson EA.

11076834,"Investigation of chronic venous insufficiency: A consensus statement (France, March 5-9, 1997).","This consensus document provides an up-to-date account of the various methods available for the investigation of chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs (CVI), with an outline of their history, usefulness, and limitations. CVI is characterized by symptoms or signs produced by venous hypertension as a result of structural or functional abnormalities of veins. The most frequent causes of CVI are primary abnormalities of the venous wall and the valves and secondary changes due to previous venous thrombosis that can lead to reflux, obstruction, or both. Because the history and clinical examination will not always indicate the nature and extent of the underlying abnormality (anatomic extent, pathology, and cause), a number of diagnostic investigations have been developed that can elucidate whether there is calf muscle pump dysfunction and determine the anatomic extent and severity of obstruction or reflux. The difficulty in deciding which investigations to use and how to interpret the results has stimulated the development of this consensus document. The aim of this document was to provide an account of these tests, with an outline of their usefulness and limitations and indications of which patients should be subjected to the tests and when and of what clinical decisions can be made. This document was written primarily for the clinician who would like to learn the latest approaches to the investigation of patients with CVI and the new applications that have emerged from recent research, as well as for the novice who is embarking on venous research. Care has been taken to indicate which methods have entered the clinical arena and which are mainly used for research. The foundation for this consensus document was laid by the faculty at a meeting held under the auspices of the American Venous Forum, the Cardiovascular Disease Educational and Research Trust, the European Society of Vascular Surgery, the International Angiology Scientific Activity Congress Organization, the International Union of Angiology, and the Union Internationale de Phlebologie at the Abbaye des Vaux de Cernay, France, on March 5 to 9, 1997.

METHODS: Venous reflux was examined using duplex colour Doppler ultrasonography in 266 legs in 191 patients. The venous refilling and reflux times were also measured.
RESULTS: Of the 266 legs, 82 per cent had reflux in the long saphenous vein (LSV), 26 per cent in the short saphenous vein (SSV), 62 per cent had incompetent perforators (IPs) in the calf and 48 per cent had reflux in the deep veins. LSV reflux combined with SSV reflux and/or IPs was associated significantly with severe venous disease and abnormal venous haemodynamics. Femoropopliteal reflux played a role in the development of venous eczema and ulcers when combined with superficial venous reflux.
CONCLUSION: Patients at high risk of developing complications of venous disease may be identified by an accurate non-invasive evaluation of reflux patterns.","['Sakurai T', 'Gupta PC', 'Matsushita M', 'Nishikimi N', 'Nimura Y']",1998,85,2,Br J Surg,"Sakurai T, et al.

9482512,Prevalence of varicose veins in an Italian elderly population.,"The prevalence of varicose veins (VV) in the elderly population of the Campania Region, in Southern Italy, was estimated. A random sample of the people aged more than 65 years was drawn by means of a stratified multistage sampling design warranting that observed percentages were direct estimates of population percentages. The investigation covered 1319 subjects, 560 (42.5%) men and 759 (57.5%) women, their ages ranging from 66 to 96 years with an average value of 74.2 years, who were interviewed and visited by trained physicians. VV were defined as any reticular or truncal visible varicosities of the lower limbs, and investigated symptoms were heaviness, pain, nightly cramps, edema, eczema, hyperpigmentation, and ulceration. Some variables were studied as risk factors: age, sex, lifetime occupation, smoking, alcohol, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity; previous treatment and use of elastic stockings were also studied. Statistical associations were evaluated by Chi-square test, a two-tailed P value of 0.05 being assumed as significance level. In total, 391 (29.6%) subjects were reported to be affected by VV, but the clinical examination was positive in only 362 (27.4%) with a good correspondence between answers and clinical findings. Prevalence was greatly affected by sex, the percentage being two times higher in women (35.2%) than in men (17%). VV developed after a pregnancy in 40.5% of women, but a high percentage of women (38.2%) also reported menopause as a time starting point. No significant association between reported risk factors and VV was found among men, whereas obesity was strongly related to VV in women. One or more symptoms were reported in 92.1% of persons affected by VV, but no previous therapy was reported by 58.9% of subjects. Only 16.9% of patients used elastic stockings with a significant difference between men (7.4%) and women (20.2%).","['Canonico S', 'Gallo C', 'Paolisso G', 'Pacifico F', 'Signoriello G', 'Sciaudone G', 'Ferrara N', 'Piegari V', 'Varricchio M', 'Rengo F']",1998,49,2,Angiology,"Canonico S, et al.

8616652,Ambulatory venous pressure: correlation with skin condition and role in identifying surgically correctible disease.,"OBJECTIVES: (1) To evaluate the full spectrum of venous skin damage with respect to ambulatory venous pressure. (2) To determine whether the ambulatory venous pressure/tourniquet test can be used to select patients for superficial venous surgery (eg. long or short saphenous stripping).
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: Vascular studies unit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ambulatory venous pressure was measured in a larger sample of limbs (360) with a wide spectrum of venous disease. In addition the effect of a tourniquet placed below the knee on ambulatory venous pressure and venous refilling time was assessed in 234 limbs. This was compared with Duplex assessment of deep and superficial venous reflux at this site.
RESULTS: There was a linear trend towards more severe skin damage with increasing ambulatory venous pressure. Ulceration was associated with more severe calf muscle pump dysfunction (higher ambulatory venous pressure) than were lipodermatosclerosis, eczema or pigmentation. The tourniquet test was not able to distinguish between deep and superficial reflux as determined by Duplex scanning.
CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory venous pressure should be used to quantify venous insufficiency and remains the reference standard test of the venous calf muscle pump. The tourniquet test should not be used to select patients for surgery since it cannot distinguish deep from superficial venous incompetence. Venous reflux is best localised using Duplex ultrasound.","['Payne SP', 'London NJ', 'Newland CJ', 'Thrush AJ', 'Barrie WW', 'Bell PR']",1996,11,2,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,"Payne SP, et al.

8659219,Management of venous leg ulcers.,"In the management of leg ulcers two aspects should be considered, i.e. the exact underlying condition (main cause and contributing factors) and local conditions. Concomitant peripheral arterial occlusive disease must systematically be excluded. Effective compression therapy (35 mmHg pressure at the distal calf) is the corner-stone in treatment of venous leg ulcers. Superficial venous reflux can be the major cause of chronic venous insufficiency. Careful examination of reflux patterns helps to distinguish between indications for conservative treatment and indications suitable for surgical treatment. To what extent the stripping of varicose veins and/or endoscopic subfascial perforator vein discision really improves the outcome and prevents recurrence still remains to be shown in controlled trials. Local treatment considers ulcer wound bed and border. Modern synthetic wound dressings follow the concept of moist wound healing whilst local application of growth factors is currently under clinical evaluation. Management of eczema includes avoidance of potent or known allergens, patch tests in severe cases with suspicion of contact dermatitis and an adapted local therapy.","['Hafner J', 'Bounameaux H', 'Burg G', 'Brunner U']",1996,25,2,Vasa,"Hafner J, et al.

Ten had ankle brachial pressure indices (ABIs) < 0.8. Of nine patients with venous disease who received compression bandaging, only two ulcers healed and have remained healed with fitted below-knee elastic stockings. The remaining patients were unable to tolerate compression or developed deterioration of their ulcers. Nine patients had unhealing arterial ulcers all unsuitable for reconstructive surgery. Five patients presented with pressure sores due to bandages, shoes or heel pressure in bed. All healed slowly with leg elevation and pressure relief. Four patients had extensive non-venous, non-arterial ulceration associated with fluid retention and dependent oedema exacerbated by spending their nights in chairs. Varicose eczema was healed in 12 patients. All the patients had multiple pathology and poorly controlled pain. Although complete healing was achieved in only six patients, the importance of ABI measurement and the gross mixed pathology suggests that every elderly patient with a leg ulcer needs medical assessment and management and that this could form a valuable service of a geriatric day hospital.","['Bliss MR', 'Schofield M']",1993,22,4,Age Ageing,Bliss MR and Schofield M.

The technique employed was a posterior subfascial approach which avoids making the skin incision through the ulcer itself. The follow up periods ranged from one to three years and there was no recurrence of the ulcer in any of the patients in the study. The major indication for performing the procedure was the presence of a varicose stasis ulcer. Before surgery, all patients had a complete peripheral vascular examination to exclude deep venous thrombosis. Healing of varicose ulcers and elimination of stasis eczema had to be achieved four weeks before surgery. The authors maintain that patients who present with varicose veins of the lower leg and a postphlebitic stasis ulceration invariably have incompetence of the valves in the perforating veins and should be treated by subfascial ligation of the perforating veins.","['Malliwah JA', 'Aziz MR', 'Amir H']",1992,41,3,Hiroshima J Med Sci,"Malliwah JA, et al.

2056926,The roles of turbulence and vasa vasorum in the aetiology of varicose veins.,"Noradrenaline can dilate a canine lateral saphenous vein which at the time is constricted by noradrenaline. It does so when it is released from the vasa vasorum network of the constricted vein. By filling a limited section of the network of a normal, tonically constricted vein with endogenous noradrenaline it is possible to dilate the vein locally, in effect creating an acute experimental varicosity. These findings have led to the proposal that human varicosities are an active response of the vein to endogenous noradrenaline released from sections of its vasa vasorum network. The noradrenaline involved is part of the circulating overflow derived from normal adrenergic nerve activity. A bout of turbulence in the vein lumen is proposed as the trigger which causes a reflux of hypoxic blood and the endogenous noradrenaline in it from the vein lumen to the vasa. The size and shape of the varix reflects the mosaic pattern of a vein's vasa vasorum network. The site of the varicosity is determined by the location in the vein lumen of the bout of turbulent non-laminar flow.",['Crotty TP'],1991,34,1,Med Hypotheses,Crotty TP.

We studied 24 normal legs (N), 21 with primary varicose veins without chronic swelling, skin changes (liposclerosis, eczema, pigmentation) or ulceration (PVV) and 59 with chronic swelling and/or skin changes and/or ulceration; of these 59 legs, 31 had primary varicose veins (PVV/S) and 28 had popliteal reflux (PR). The classification was done according to clinical examination, Duplex scanning, ambulatory venous pressure measurements and venography. There was an increased incidence of sequelae with increasing values of VFI. The incidence of these sequelae was irrespective of whether reflux was in the deep or in the superficial veins. VFI is a practical non-invasive measurement of reflux. It should be used to study the effect of therapy and particularly to evaluate new reconstructive procedures designed to abolish reflux in the deep veins.","['Christopoulos D', 'Nicolaides AN', 'Szendro G']",1988,75,4,Br J Surg,"Christopoulos D, et al.

There is no clear distinction between inflammation, and tissular sclerosis, the final stage of its development. There may be a certain lesional reversibility. The term ""scleroinflammatory cellulitis"" is therefore quite apt. Physiopathology. Pathology venous reflex results in a flood of proteins in the interstitial tissue, and this shows in signs of tissular pain, especially at the level of the hypoderm and dermis (anatomical reasons). Clinical. This is most often in the case of women with varicose affections or with post-phlebitic syndromes causing a painful, inflamed plaque, on the surface of the inside leg, at the junction of the middle and lower thirds. As well as the inflammation of this area, adhesion to the subjacent layers and induration are also confirmed. Venous dilations may be detected at the centre of this scleroinflammatory plaque. To begin with, the skin is red and taut, but later becomes dry and atrophic. It is prone to eczema and sometimes to ulceration. The development of subcutaneous inflammation is marked by sudden manifestation of inflammation which may be extensive and results in circular suffing, in extreme cases. Varicose sclerosis can provoke sudden manifestations of inflammation and especially if the technique is faulty (excessive dosage, lack of compression, insufficient compression). Treatment. 1. Local. Bandaging and walking are imperative. The bandage must be compressive, immovable, durable, and should be reinforced as necessary at the site of the induration, by latex rubber pads. Once the object of these slightly or non-elastic pads has been achieved they can be replaced by elastic contention. 2. General. Corticoids and phenylbutazone in short courses of treatment. Other products constitute auxiliary remedies. Thermal cures are always indicated in difficult cases. Medical treatment is often enough. In certain perverse cases a surgical treatment may be required, such as hypodermal resection and ligation of the perforants. Grafts (Vigoni).

5439085,Stability of neomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.,"A strain of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from the skin of a subject with eczema showed a loss in resistance to neomycin and tetracycline after treatment with neomycin was stopped. Seven out of 22 strains of neomycin-resistant Staph. aureus showed a loss in resistance to neomycin and streptomycin after storage in nutrient broth for 14 days at room temperature, and it seems probable that resistance in these unstable strains was controlled by extrachromosomal elements or plasmids. Strains of phage types 84/85 and 29/77 and related types were frequently isolated in general hospital wards and showed no loss in resistance on similar storage in nutrient broth. Five of the neomycin-unstable strains were isolated from patients with eczematous lesions. Multiple-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive strains of Staph. aureus of similar phage type were isolated from patients in a ward for patients with skin disease, and the possibility of transfer of resistance in vivo is discussed.",['Ayliffe GA'],1970,23,1,J Clin Pathol,Ayliffe GA.
