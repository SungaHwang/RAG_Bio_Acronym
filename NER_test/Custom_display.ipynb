    "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a clear threat to humanity. It has infected over 200 million and killed 4 million people worldwide, and infections continue with no end in sight. To control the pandemic, multiple effective vaccines have been developed, and global vaccinations are in progress. However, the virus continues to mutate. Even when full vaccine coverage is achieved, vaccine-resistant mutants will likely emerge, thus requiring new annual vaccines against drifted variants analogous to influenza. A complimentary solution to this problem could be developing antiviral drugs that inhibit SARS CoV-2 and its drifted variants. Host defense peptides represent a potential source for such an antiviral as they possess broad antimicrobial activity and significant diversity across species. We screened the cathelicidin family of peptides from 16 different species for antiviral activity and identified a wild boar peptide derivative that inhibits SARS CoV-2. This peptide, which we named Yongshi and means warrior in Mandarin, acts as a viral entry inhibitor. Following the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to its receptor, the spike protein is cleaved, and heptad repeats 1 and 2 multimerize to form the fusion complex that enables the virion to enter the cell. A deep learning-based protein sequence comparison algorithm and molecular modeling suggest that Yongshi acts as a mimetic to the heptad repeats of the virus, thereby disrupting the fusion process. Experimental data confirm the binding of Yongshi to the heptad repeat 1 with a fourfold higher affinity than heptad repeat 2 of SARS-CoV-2. Yongshi also binds to the heptad repeat 1 of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Interestingly, it inhibits all drifted variants of SARS CoV-2 that we tested, including the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, kappa and omicron variants.[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2022.829241.].BACKGROUND: Since November 2019, when the novel coronavirus arose in Wuhan City, over 188 million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19. It is the third coronavirus outbreak in the twenty-first century. Until now, practically all coronavirus epidemics have occurred due to zoonotic spread from an animal or transitional host or through the consumption of their products. Coronaviruses can infect humans and cause severe illness and even death.\n",
    "MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review was designed to help us recognize and harmonize the similarities and differences between these three coronaviridae family members.\n",
    "RESULT: Measures aimed at containing the epidemic should be emphasized in this circumstance. Prioritizing and planning these activities require an understanding of the particulars of these three viruses. Given the pandemic's enormous death toll and rapid spread, we should be cognizant of the parallels and differences between these three viruses. Additionally, this pandemic warns us to be cautious against the possibility of a future pandemic.\n",
    "CONCLUSION: We highlight the fundamental characteristics of coronaviruses that are critical for recognizing coronavirus epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathological features that reveal numerous significant pathological attributes and evolutionary patterns in the viral genome that aid in better understanding and anticipating future epidemics.There is an urgent need for highly effective therapeutic agents to interrupt the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2. As a pivotal protease in the replication process of coronaviruses, the 3CLpro protein is considered as a potential target of drug development to stop the spread and infection of the virus. In this work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a novel and highly effective non-covalent inhibitor, WU-04, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro protein. The difference in dynamic behavior between the BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are associated with critical illnesses, including severe respiratory disorders. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the deadly COVID-19 illness, which has spread globally as a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 may enter the human body through olfactory lobes and interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) receptor, further facilitating cell binding and entry into the cells. Reports have shown that the virus can pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in various disorders. Cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 largely relies on TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, which activate S protein. TMPRSS2 is found on the cell surface of respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital epithelium, while cathepsin-L is a part of endosomes.\n",
    "AIM: The current review aims to provide information on how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects brain function.. Furthermore, CNS disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including ischemic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, and encephalitis, are discussed. The many probable mechanisms and paths involved in developing cerebrovascular problems in COVID patients are thoroughly detailed.\n",
    "MAIN BODY: There have been reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system (CNS), where it could cause a various illnesses. Patients suffering from COVID-19 experience a range of neurological complications, including sleep disorders, viral encephalitis, headaches, dysgeusia, and cognitive impairment. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 patients has been reported. Health experts also reported its presence in cortical neurons and human brain organoids. The possible mechanism of virus infiltration into the brain can be neurotropic, direct infiltration and cytokine storm-based pathways. The olfactory lobes could also be the primary pathway for the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain.\n",
    "CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can lead to neurological complications, such as cerebrovascular manifestations, motor movement complications, and cognitive decline. COVID-19 infection can result in cerebrovascular symptoms and diseases, such as strokes and thrombosis. The virus can affect the neural system, disrupt cognitive function and cause neurological disorders. To combat the epidemic, it is crucial to repurpose drugs currently in use quickly and develop novel therapeutics.Four new isoorotamide (Io) containing PNA nucleobases were designed for A-U recognition of double helical RNA. New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA 9-mers for binding A-U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly-modified PNA compared to known A-binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen-hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A-binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious global threat with surging new variants of concern. Although global vaccinations have slowed the pandemic, their longevity is still unknown. Therefore, new orally administrable antiviral agents are highly demanded. Among various repurposed drugs, niclosamide (NIC) is the most potential one for various viral diseases such as COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome), influenza, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), etc. Since NIC cannot be effectively absorbed, a required plasma concentration for antiviral potency is hard to maintain, thereby restricting its entry into the infected cells. Such a 60-year-old bioavailability challenging issue has been overcome by engineering with MgO and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), forming hydrophilic NIC-MgO-HPMC, with improved intestinal permeability without altering NIC metabolism as confirmed by parallel artificial membrane permeability assay. The inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2  replication is confirmed in the Syrian hamster model to reduce lung injury. Clinical studies reveal that the bioavailability of NIC hybrid drug can go 4 times higher than the intact NIC. The phase II clinical trial shows a dose-dependent bioavailability of NIC from hybrid drug  suggesting its potential applicability as a game changer in achieving the much-anticipated endemic phase.Host kinases play essential roles in the host cell cycle, innate immune signaling, the stress response to viral infection, and inflammation. Previous work has demonstrated that coronaviruses specifically target kinase cascades to subvert host cell responses to infection and rely upon host kinase activity to phosphorylate viral proteins to enhance replication. Given the number of kinase inhibitors that are already FDA approved to treat cancers, fibrosis, and other human disease, they represent an attractive class of compounds to repurpose for host-targeted therapies against emerging coronavirus infections. To further understand the host kinome response to betacoronavirus infection, we employed multiplex inhibitory bead mass spectrometry (MIB-MS) following MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung epithelial cell lines. Our MIB-MS analyses revealed activation of mTOR and MAPK signaling following MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 host kinome responses were further characterized using paired phosphoproteomics, which identified activation of MAPK, PI3K, and mTOR signaling. Through chemogenomic screening, we found that clinically relevant PI3K/mTOR inhibitors were able to inhibit coronavirus replication at nanomolar concentrations similar to direct-acting antivirals. This study lays the groundwork for identifying broad-acting, host-targeted therapies to reduce betacoronavirus replication that can be rapidly repurposed during future outbreaks and epidemics. The proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and MIB-MS datasets generated in this study are available in the Proteomics Identification Database (PRIDE) repository under project identifiers PXD040897 and PXD040901.Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought an unprecedented public health crisis and continues to threaten humanity due to the persistent emergence of new variants. Therefore, developing more effective and broad-spectrum therapeutic and prophylactic drugs against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, as well as future emerging CoVs, is urgently needed. In this study, we screened several US FDA-approved drugs and identified phenothiazine derivatives with the ability to potently inhibit the infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and distinct variants of concern (VOCs), including B.1.617.2 (Delta) and currently circulating Omicron sublineages XBB and BQ.1.1, as well as pseudotyped SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Mechanistic studies suggested that phenothiazines predominantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) infection at the early stage and potentially bound to the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which may prevent the proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, thereby exhibiting inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our findings suggest that phenothiazines can serve as a potential broad-spectrum therapeutic drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the infection of future emerging human coronaviruses (HCoVs).Whether RNA-RNA interactions of cytoplasmic RNA viruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe diseases in humans. Camels act as intermediate hosts for MERS-CoV. Currently, no licensed vaccine is available for this virus. We have developed a potential candidate vaccine for MERS-CoV using the cold adaptation method. We cultivated the vaccine in Vero cells at temperatures as low as 22 °C. This live-attenuated vaccine virus showed high attenuation levels in transgenic mice with the MERS-CoV human receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (K18-hDPP4). The inoculated K18-hDPP4 mice exhibited no clinical signs such as death or body weight loss. Furthermore, no traces of infectious virus were observed when the tissues (nasal turbinate, brain, lung, and kidney) of the K18-hDPP4 mice infected with the cold-adapted vaccine strain were tested. A single intranasal dose of the vaccine administered to the noses of the K18-hDPP4 mice provided complete protection. We did not observe any deaths, body weight loss, or viral detection in the tissues (nasal turbinate, brain, lung, and kidney). Based on these promising results, the developed cold-adapted, attenuated MERS-CoV vaccine strain could be one of the candidates for human and animal vaccines.The drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria is often due efflux pumps-specific proteins that remove foreign compounds from bacterial cells. To overcome drug resistance, adjuvants are often used that can inhibit efflux pumps or other systems that ensure the resistance of bacteria to the action of antibiotics. We assumed that a new level of effectiveness with the use of an antibiotic + an adjuvant pair could be achieved by their joint delivery into the pathogen. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of molecular carriers based on poly-(olygo-, dendry)mers based on cyclodextrin-grafted PEI or mannan, as well as glycol chitosan, covalently bound to antibiotic, adjuvant, and the oligosaccharide ligand to the macrophage mannose receptor (CD206), which we studied earlier and showed high efficiency and selectivity of delivery of a therapeutic \"cargo\" to macrophages. Moxifloxacin was used as an antibiotic, and terpenoid and allylbenzene compounds were used as adjuvants, for which we previously discovered the ability to inhibit bacterial efflux pumps. We show that: (a) the resulting structures were stable in vitro for a long time (up to 10 days); (b) they were adsorbed on bacterial cells, providing a local increase in the concentration of the antibiotic and adjuvant in pathogen cells; (c) they were internalized by bacterial cells, ensuring the accumulation of both antibiotic and adjuvant inside bacterial cells; (d) the adjuvant, after entering the bacterial cell, provided inhibition of the efflux pumps; (e) due to this action of the adjuvant, combined with the targeted delivery by the carrier, the antibiotic's half-life in rats increased by more than 2 times, the effective concentration of the drug in the blood plasma (AUC) increased up to 8-10 times; (f) a significant increase in the effectiveness of the antibacterial action against Gram+ and Gram- cells was achieved (up to 3 times). Potentially, such an approach would significantly increase the effectiveness of therapies for a number of infectious and other diseases, reduce the dosage of antibiotics, shorten the duration of treatment, and reduce the risk of developing bacterial resistance. Moreover, the use of a polymer carrier with covalently bound organic molecules of different structures will avoid problems linked to different (suboptimal) solubility and bio-distribution of the administered molecules, which would be almost inevitable when using the same compounds separately. It would be very difficult to find antibiotic/adjuvant pairs that simultaneously achieve optimal concentrations in the same target cells. In our case, terpenoids and alkylbenzenes used as adjuvants are practically insoluble as individual compounds, and their unacceptable pharmacological properties would not allow them to be used as efflux pump inhibitors.BACKGROUND: It is crucial to study the public's perceptions and behaviour during a pandemic as this will be the driving force for practicing recommended precautions. The current study aimed to identify perceptions of a group of Egyptian adults to COVID-19 using the Health Belief Model (HBM), to measure self-reported practice of preventive behaviours and to identify influencing factors.\n",
    "METHODS: Cross sectional study was used, including Egyptian adults aged 18 + years. A structured anonymous online questionnaire was used including: a demographic section, the modified MERS- CoV Health Belief Model scale after addition of questions related to COVID-19 and questions on preventive behaviours to COVID-19.\n",
    "RESULTS: Of the 532 study participants, 28.6% were males, age ranges (18 to 74 years). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between total practice score and all COVID-19 Health Belief Model constructs total scores except for perceived barriers score showing negative correlation (P value < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that older age, male gender and living inside Cairo were associated with lower practice score (P value < 0.01).\n",
